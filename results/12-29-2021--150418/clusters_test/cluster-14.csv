"The Evolution of Gene Regulation and Human Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Genetic variants that disrupt the functionality of regulatory sequences, and thereby alter gene expression levels, are major contributors to both evolutionary divergence between species and differences in risk for complex disease among humans. However, due to the complexity of the gene regulatory programs encoded in mammalian genomes and their rapid turnover between species, evaluating the function of non-protein-coding mutations is challenging. This is a major roadblock to tracing the evolution of human-specific biology. In addition, since the majority of disease-associated variants are non-coding, it impairs our ability to map the genetics of complex disease.  The long-term mission of my lab is to interpret the complex gene regulatory programs encoded in the human genome and accurately model the effects of genetic mutations to these elements on phenotypes relevant to disease and human evolution. We work toward these goals by integrating cutting-edge machine learning, statistical modeling of evolution, and the analysis of genotypes and phenotypes from large-scale clinical biobanks. In particular, my lab is uniquely well positioned to build on our previous work to address the following fundamental questions:  1. How have evolutionary transitions on the human-lineage modified the genome—in particular gene  regulatory programs—to produce human-specific biology? And how do these modifications relate to  human-specific disease risk?  2. What are the combinatorial rules underlying how TF binding patterns specify precise control of gene  regulation? And how do these gene regulatory “programs” evolve between species?  3. How do genetic and epigenetic mechanisms interact to specify the dynamic gene regulatory programs  that drive cellular development? And how are these programs perturbed in disease?  4. How can we interpret non-protein-coding mutations identified in patient genomes to inform treatment  and preventative care? Our work will produce much-needed methods for understanding the effects of mutations to gene regulatory regions and identify mutations responsible for differences in disease risk between human populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE The genetic mutations that distinguish humans from other great apes and that influence risk for complex disease are mostly found outside of genes. Many of these mutations influence when and where genes are expressed. However, we do not know how to interpret the effects of most such mutations on gene regulation, disease risk, or human evolution, we will develop computational models that leverage machine learning, evolutionary patterns, and large-scale clinical biobanks to identify mutations that disrupt proper control of genes and lead to disease.",The Evolution of Gene Regulation and Human Disease,10126866,R35GM127087,"['Biology ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Evolution ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pongidae ', ' Apes ', ' great ape ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Risk ', ' Work ', ' species difference ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' DNA mutation ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' genomic alteration ', ' DNA Sequence Alteration ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' To specify ', ' Modification ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' combinatorial ', ' mammalian genome ', ' human disease ', ' cellular development ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative care ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R35,2021,394980,CA-12
"Leveraging the TCR Repertoire to identify target neoantigens in FLT3-ITD positive Acute Myeloid Leukemia Abstract Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative treatment for patients with high- risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, HSCT is affected by graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and graft- versus-leukemia (GvL) effects, both are mediated by donor T lymphocytes and significantly impact treatment success and thus overall outcome. AML patients commonly harbor FLT3/internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD), a mutation in the receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3 that is associated with poor prognosis. FLT3 targeted therapies have proven clinical benefit particularly when used in combinational approaches. Midostaurin (a kinase inhibitor) was recently approved for pre-transplant patients with FLT3-ITD in combination with standard therapy. In addition to their direct leukemia suppressive effects, FLT3 inhibitors activate leukemia antigen-specific T-cell responses. T-cell receptors (TCRs) are proteins expressed on the surface of T cells that recognize antigens presented by MHC molecules. We recently characterized the TCR repertoire in patients who underwent matched donor or haplo-cord HSCT. We demonstrated that GvHD and relapse (exclusive of each other) are associated with lower TCR repertoire diversity and expansion of certain T-cell clones. Our data suggest that individual variations in the immune repertoire significantly impact the clinical outcome in AML patients and underscore the need for comprehensive quantitative, functional, and mechanistic analyses of the TCR repertoire in a large cohort of AML patients. Here, we hypothesize: 1) TCR repertoire (diversity, clonal expansion, and V-segment utilization) affects clinical outcome (GvHD or relapse) and can therefore be used to identify GvL- and GvHD- associated clones; 2) Somatic mutations in leukemic cells (e.g., FLT3-ITD) affect the TCR repertoire and subsequent expansion of specific T-cell clones; and 3) FLT3 inhibitors (e.g., midostaurin) modulate the TCR repertoire and function and enhance GvL effects in patients undergoing HSCT. We will conduct a prospective longitudinal cohort study characterizing the TCR repertoire and mutational landscape of leukemia cells in ~250 patients (~ 60–80 with FLT3-ITD). GvHD or relapse will be predicted using a proportional hazards model for competing risks based on TCR repertoire characteristics. TCR sequences and somatic mutations will be analyzed using a structure based prediction algorithms we developed to predict candidate leukemia neoantigens and associated TCR clones. Neoantigens will be validated using in vitro and murine models. Finally, functional analyses will examine the effect of midostaurin on TCR repertoire and function. Our findings will establish the TCR repertoire as a useful tool for predicting clinical outcomes of HSCT and identify responsible TCR clones. The identification of TCR clones associated with the GvL effect against FLT3-ITD+ cells will facilitate the development of engineered T cells expressing GvL-associated TCR clones. Modifying the TCR repertoire composition via therapies targeting specific somatic mutations will facilitate development of optimized combinational therapeutic approaches, such as the addition of targeted therapy to post-transplant regimens. Narrative: Sparing normal cells while killing leukemic cells (harnessing the graft-versus-leukemia effect) by manipulating alloreactive T cells remains challenging in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), the only curative approach for patients with high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this proposed research, we leverage genomic and immunogenomic data obtained from patients undergoing HSCT to identify leukemia- specific neoantigens for preclinical investigation as potential therapeutic targets. The knowledge resulting from this proposed research will advance the development of personalized treatments for AML patients.",Leveraging the TCR Repertoire to identify target neoantigens in FLT3-ITD positive Acute Myeloid Leukemia,10120569,R01CA248381,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clone Cells ', ' Diagnosis ', ' graft vs host disease ', ' GvHD ', ' Homologous Wasting Disease ', ' Runt Disease ', ' graft versus host disease ', ' graft vs. host disease ', ' Immunotherapy ', ' Immune mediated therapy ', ' Immunologically Directed Therapy ', ' immune therapeutic approach ', ' immune therapeutic interventions ', ' immune therapeutic regimens ', ' immune therapeutic strategy ', ' immune therapy ', ' immune-based therapies ', ' immune-based treatments ', ' immuno therapy ', ' In Vitro ', ' knowledge of results ', ' leukemia ', ' Acute Myelocytic Leukemia ', ' AML -

"Blood mitochondrial DNA biomarkers of midlife cognitive decline and adverse brain imaging changes - A longitudinal investigation in the CARDIA population‐based cohort study SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRDs) are typically the result of neurodegenerative processes that begin 15-20 years before clinical diagnosis. Despite this lengthy subclinical phase and advances in early diagnostic technologies including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, brain MRIs, and positron emission tomography (PET) measures there are no scalable biomarkers to identify individuals with preclinical disease, which may offer the best time window for intervention. Specifically, because brain MRI and PET tests are resource-intensive and CSF sampling is invasive, there is urgent need for biomarkers based on blood samples, which can be non-invasively collected even in centers lacking highly specialized technology. The mitochondrial genome (mtDNA), unlike the stable nuclear genome, is dynamic and accumulates somatic mutations over the lifespan. Mutations in the mtDNA can be induced by oxidative stress and lead to declining mitochondrial function as we age; in turn, less functional mitochondria generate higher levels of oxidative stress, which induces chronic inflammation and tissue injury in specific organs including the brain. Yet, no study has investigated mtDNA mutations as early predictors of ADRD. We hypothesize that individuals with higher levels and faster accumulation of blood mtDNA mutations have greater cognitive decline and preclinical ADRD brain imaging changes during midlife, and that these mtDNA biomarkers will predict ADRD diagnosis in older adults. We will test our hypotheses by leveraging the NHLBI-funded Coronary Artery Risk Development In young Adults (CARDIA) study. CARDIA is a multicenter, community-based, longitudinal cohort that recruited 5,115 black and white young adults (mean age 25 years), followed them up at least every five years, and is preparing to conduct its examination Year 35 (Y35) visit in 2020/21 (mean age 60 years) when over 3,000 participants are expected to return. We will use state-of-the-art deep sequencing technology to measure mtDNA mutations in CARDIA blood samples collected at Y15, Y25, and Y35. In Aim 1, we will determine whether higher levels of mtDNA mutations and their accumulation over time are associated with greater cognitive decline in midlife. In Aim 2, we will determine whether mtDNA mutations are associated with structural, physiological, and functional MRI phenotypes of preclinical ADRD as well as with sensitive MRI-based markers of accelerated brain aging and preclinical ADRD constructed by our team using contemporary machine learning techniques. Finally, in Aim 3, we will test the clinical utility of these mtDNA mutation biomarkers in identifying individuals at risk of future ADRD in four older cohorts that have large numbers of longitudinally identified, clinically-diagnosed ADRD. Our focus on longitudinal measures of blood mtDNA, cognitive function, and MRI changes over a 10- year period during midlife, combined with characterization of their clinical utility in older populations, is highly innovative. If successful, our study may help initiate possible future interventions in early midlife and reduce the public health and medical burden of AD and dementia. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT This study has high potential for characterizing novel blood-based biomarkers to identify preclinical ADRD and test their utility in predicting clinical ADRD. No other study has a similar design with repeated blood mtDNA mutations, cognitive assessments, and brain imaging data during midlife, a critical time window for interventions to prevent clinical ADRD development. By also using data from four large cohorts of older adults, we can determine the clinical utility of these mtDNA biomarkers to predict clinical ADRD and move the field closer toward the NIH’s goal of personalized health interventions.",Blood mitochondrial DNA biomarkers of midlife cognitive decline and adverse brain imaging changes - A longitudinal investigation in the CARDIA population‐based

"Single Cell Mosaic Mutation Atlas of Human Organ PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Somatic mosaicism is a biological phenomenon that describes the presence of genetically distinct cells within a subject. Mosaic mutations dictate numerous human phenotypes and are causal factors for a range of human diseases such as autisim, cardiac disorders and cancers. Analysis of somatic mutations in normal tissues is important for the understanding of both normal phenotype manifestations and the early onset of human diseases. However, our current knowledge of the mosaic mutations is only the tip of the iceberg due to the technical and computational challenges in detecting mosaic mutations with bulk genomic methods. In the past 3-5 years, high throughout single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have emerged as powerful tools to dissect the cellular ecosystems of human tissues by profiling thousands of single cell transcriptomes. The human cell atlas (HCA) projects have generated huge number of scRNA-seq datasets for many human organs from eye to brain. Whereas these projects are focused on delineating cell types and cell states within each tissue, they provide tremendous data resources to investigate the full spectrum of rare mosaic mutations in human organs. The lack of robust computational tools presents as one major gap in knowledge to construct a global mosaic mutation atlas of human organs from these data. Previous studies used bulk mutation calling methods to perform single cell genotyping from scRNA-seq data, which however had low sensitivity that is equivalent to bulk approaches. The central hypothesis is that rare mosaic mutations and their diversified effects on cellular functions can be uncovered by genotyping single cells from scRNA-seq data. This project has three major research goals: 1) Develop robust computational methods to accurately detect rare mosaic mutations from scRNA-seq data. This includes a Bayesian method MosaiCopy for detection of copy number variations, a toolkit MosaiTect for discovery of allele-specific point mutations, and a model-based method MosaiMtTect to detect mutations in mtDNAs in individual cells. 2) Estimate the functional effects of mosaic mutations in rare cells by developing a machine-learning software scGPS (single cell Genotype-Phenotype Synergy). Additionally, this method will quantify the threshold of phenotype manifestation for each mosaic mutation. 3) Genotype HCA datasets to investigate the cell type and cell state specific mutations and their functions in affected cells of human organs. As a case study and validation of the results, the in-house heart cell atlas datasets will be generated from healthy hearts (collected during heart transplantation). The overall goal of this project is to develop novel computational methods to investigate the global pictures of mosaic mutations and functional effects on cells of human organs. Successful completion of this project will lead to new insights into the effects of genomic diversification on cell functions within human body. In long term, this study will have significant impact on the development of novel prevention strategies for human diseases by inhibiting the manifestations of clinical phenotypes at the very early stage of normal development. PROJECT NARATIVE Analysis of rare somatic mutations in normal tissues is important for understanding the manifestation of normal phenotypes and the genetic disposition of human diseases. This project aims to detect mosaic mutations from scRNA-seq data generated by human cell atlas and many related projects to quantify their prevalence and functional effects on the rare mutated cells. Our bioinformatic tools provide a cost-effective way to construct a full picture of mosaic mutation atlas of human organs, to understand the effects of genomic diversification on cell functions within human body, and to develop novel strategies to prevent the clinical phenotype manifestations of human diseases.",Single Cell Mosaic Mutation Atlas of Human Organ,10498663,R35GM142539,[''],NIGMS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R35,2021,400000,IL-07
"The interaction of myosin and the thin filament: how mutations cause allosteric dysfunction and their connection to genetic cardiomyopathy Project Summary: The long-term goal of this research program is to develop a rigorously experimentally validated all-atom computational model of the cardiac thin filament (CTF) bound to myosin S1 which provides a unique and accessible platform to identify novel, high resolution disease mechanisms linked to Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM). In the prior funding period, we refined and extended our existing CTF computational model and successfully employed it to identify unique and clinically relevant allosteric disease mechanisms including HCM mutation-induced changes in myofilament Ca2+ kinetics, mutation-specific molecular causes of differential cardiac remodeling and disease progression. This included an in vivo validation via the development of a novel transgenic mouse model of cTnT-linked dilated cardiomyopathy and a predictive algorithm to determine the pathogenicity of cTnT mutations that out-performed existing computational approaches in a preliminary test. The key to these advances has been the ability of the current model to precisely identify and locate allosteric changes caused by mutations throughout all components of the CTF followed by closely coupled experimental validation and eventual in vivo model correlation. We now propose to significantly expand the biological complexity of the model to include myosin S1, the molecular motor that drives contraction and the second most common genetic cause of HCM. This important and challenging advance will facilitate a deeper understanding of disease pathogenesis by, for the first time, incorporating the role of molecular allosteric mechanisms between myosin S1 and thin filament. This new computational – experimental platform will be used for both mechanistic insight (for example used for the identification of novel myofilament disease targets,) and the development of a comprehensive deep-learning predictive algorithm to assign pathogenicity to both myosin and thin filament HCM mutations. The latter represents the first use of high-resolution structure, dynamics and function to predict HCM disease allele pathogenicity, a central challenge in the clinical management of these complex patients. Both the training and testing components of the deep learning development will utilize data from the highly annotated and curated SHaRe HCM registry thus greatly improving translational power. Two Specific Aims will be pursued: Aim 1 will utilize state of the art rare event simulation methods developed in one of our groups and refinement of existing unstructured domains of the CTF via FRET to establish the new model. Aim 2 will employ an extensive program of computational analysis and subsequent in vitro validation using pathogenic, variants of unknown significance and non- pathogenic HCM alleles derived from SHaRe to provide inputs to the machine learning environment for algorithm development. Novel disease mechanisms for myosin and thin filament HCM that include crosstalk between the two components will also be explored. Elucidation of these mechanisms can be the basis for robust molecular approaches to disease. Precision medicine and “molecular” medicine are concepts that aim to employ a patient’s genetic structure to discern the best medical treatments for disease. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a genetic disease that afflicts 1/500 people. This application translates our knowledge of the molecular level effects of cardiac tissue mutation to disease and will aim to lead to eventual treatment.",The interaction of myosin and the thin

"ADPKD: Disease Spectrum & Genotype-Phenotype Correlations Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common monoallelic disorder associated with progressive cyst development and resulting in end stage renal failure (ESRD) in 50% of patients by 60y. However, there is considerable phenotypic variability, extending from in utero onset to patients with adequate renal function into old age. Autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (ADPLD), as traditionally defined, results in PLD with minimal renal cysts. Classically there have been considered two ADPKD genes, PKD1 and PKD2, encoding PC1 and PC2, and two ADPLD genes, PRKCSH and SEC63, but in the past few years greater genetic heterogeneity has been described, with nine genes now implicated overall. Recent data also indicates an overlap in etiology and pathogenesis associated with ADPKD and ADPLD, with the efficient biogenesis and localization of the PC-complex central to both disorders. During the last funding period we identified a novel gene, GANAB, which is associated with both disorders, where the encoded protein, GII is involved in the maturation and trafficking of PC1.  In this proposal we will take advantage of advances in next generation sequencing (NGS) methodologies, and large populations of ADPKD and ADPLD patients that have been assembled and screened for the classic genes, to hunt for novel genes for these disorders (Aim 1). The phenotype associated with these genes will be characterized (Aim 3) along with their mechanism of action (Aim 2). NGS methods will be perfected to screen the segmentally duplicated locus, PKD1, and to identify missed mutations at the known loci, including those present in just some cells due to mosaicism (Aim 1). The significance of many PKD1 nontruncating variants has been difficult to evaluate (classed as variants of unknown significance; VUS), but recently evidence that some are incompletely penetrant alleles partially explains phenotypic variability in PKD1 populations. In Aim 2 improved in silico predictions, in combination with machine learning, will improve the understanding of the pathogenicity and penetrance of VUS. A cellular assay of the biogenesis and trafficking of this PC-complex will also be employed to quantify the penetrance of VUS. The mechanism of pathogenesis will be explored in animal models with ultralow penetrant (ULP) Pkd1 or Pkd2 alleles. Employing the large clinically, imaging, and genetically well-defined populations phenotypic groupings of patients will be defined that will then be compared to the genic and PKD1 allelic groups (Aim 3). This iterative process will allow the Variant Score (VS) associated with each PKD1 VUS to be refined. In a separate population the revised VS, alone and in combination with clinical, functional, and imaging data, will be employed to generate a comprehensive, predictive algorithm for ADPKD (Aim 3). Disease modifiers to severe disease, via biallelic ADPKD, and due to alleles at other loci will also be identified and characterized in the cellular assay and in vivo in combination with the Pkd1 hypomorphic, RC model. The final aim will exploit the newly identified information that some PKD1 and PKD2 VUS are rescuable, folding mutations that in a maturation-fostering environment can traffic and function appropriately. A screening scheme based on the level of cell surface PC1 will be improved and new chaperone drugs specific for the PC complex will be sought in collaboration with Sanford Burnham Prebys. A second mutation group that will be explored therapeutically are nonsense mutations. A cellular assay for readthrough efficiency is being developed and will be used for screening. Identified chaperone or readthrough drugs will be tested in available mouse models. Overall this proposal will better explain the etiology and the genetic causes of phenotypic variability in ADPKD/ADPLD, develop better prognostic tools for individual selection of patients for treatment that are now becoming available, and explore allele based treatments for ADPKD. ADPKD and ADPLD are genetic diseases associated with cyst development and loss of function in the kidney and liver cysts, where the disease severity varies greatly between patients. Here we will identify new genes that cause these disorders and evaluate mutations in silico, in a cellular assay, and in whole animals to better predict the disease course in each patient. Treatment options associated with the type of individual patient mutations will also be explored, bringing individualized medicine to these diseases.",ADPKD: Disease Spectrum & Genotype-Phenotype

"Precision base editing for the treatment of motor neuron diseases Motor neuron diseases (MNDs) such as spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are a class of progressive neurodegeneration disorders, often caused by minor genetic abnormalities to which motor neurons are particularly vulnerable. Because each of these diseases is rare and the molecular pathologies so diverse and unresolved, it is hard to envision a therapeutic intervention tailored to each individually, or a single treatment to effectively treat them all. Current genome editing tools are easily programmable to target discrete genomic loci and affected tissues of MNDs are largely similar. Thus, a general genome editing therapeutic strategy for MNDs fitted to each mutation could meet this urgent need.  Base editing tools can theoretically correct any C:G>T:A and A:T>G:C transition, yet the factors that determine efficiency and precision of base editing are not fully understood, and editing outcomes at a given locus are frequently unpredictable. For the development of base editing correction strategies at a great number of loci, screening through a multitude of base editor variants – currently any permutation of >10 deaminase enzymes and >15 Cas proteins, and counting – and sgRNA combinations for every target is prohibitive. A clear understanding of Cas protein, deaminase, and sequence determinants of editing outcomes is needed to facilitate the design of base editing strategies. We intend to develop a general workflow to design effective base editing strategies for causal MND SNPs and deliver these tools to MND affected tissues.  SMA is a monogenic MND with a well-defined genetic cause, and animal models harboring the human causal gene that faithfully recapitulate disease phenotypes of SMA patients. Successful development of an effective and safe SMA genome editing treatment will assist the development of similar genome editing therapeutics for other genetic MNDs, including some forms of familial ALS.  In this project we will (1) create a computational predictive model of base editing to facilitate the design of effective base editing strategies; (2) develop protocols to efficiently deliver base editing therapeutics to disease relevant tissues in mice to enable genome editing; and (3) use this pipeline to optimize a base editing therapeutic to rescue SMA in mice, and develop genome editing therapeutics for other causal MND mutations, focusing first on the most common single point mutation causal to ALS in North America, SOD1A4V.  I will take advantage of the world-class genomics environment of the Broad Institute and the expertise in AAV-delivery at the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research to realize these goals and develop skills that will help me to continue this work as an independent investigator. Through mentorship meetings and courses on grant-writing and data visualization I will improve my science-communication skills so that I may compete successfully for additional NIH R01 and R21 funding as a faculty member. By attending conferences and publishing my work I intend to establish myself as leader in the field of therapeutic genome editing for MND. Many motor neuron diseases (MNDs) such as spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and some forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) result from minor genetic mutations that cause damage and cell-death in a largely similar set of tissues, thus a method to genomically correct MND mutations in affected tissues could therapeutically treat MNDs of many genetic origins. Clarity on the determinants of base editing outcomes is much needed to efficiently and precisely correct disease-relevant single nucleotide mutations that are intractable to conventional base editing tools, including many MND targets such as the pathogenic SMA allele and the ALS SOD1A4V mutation. By thorough characterization of base editor variants, and establishing an effective method to deliver genome editing tools to MND relevant tissues in vivo, we will create a general pipeline to design and validate optimized base editing strategies to correct causal MND mutations for the development of a therapeutic treatment for SMA and other genetic MNDs.",Precision base editing for the treatment

"The MSK Genomic Data Analysis Center for Tumor Evolution Abstract The MSK Genomic Data Analysis Center for Tumor Evolution seeks to implement tools, best practices and analytical workflows for studying cancer evolution from cancer genome and transcriptome sequencing data. Over the last 15 years, survey sequencing of patient populations of many cancer types has elucidated novel driver mutations which are mechanistically responsible for disease pathogenesis. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and individual laboratory efforts have broadened the understanding of biological processes impacted by somatic mutation and revealed new therapeutic targets that have achieved clinical impact. However, most of this work has been based on bulk DNA sequencing from primary tumors and single biopsies from patients. It is well understood that cancer is an evolutionary process during which clonal expansions within patients generates heterogeneity and phenotypic diversity of cell populations across metastatic sites over time (with or without therapeutic intervention). Indeed, the same targeted therapies developed based on mutation discoveries often select for resistant clones, keeping durable cures out of reach. We will develop analytical methods, tools and software infrastructure to study cancer progression through the lens of evolution, shifting emphasis from analysis of primary tumors to dynamic analyses over clinical trajectories. We expect our program will advance the ability to study clinical trajectories of patients in a more comprehensive approach, including temporal, spatial and single cell analysis to better represent the full clonal repertoires of tumors and to study the determinants of how and why tumors evolve. We use tools, well established in our laboratories, in three key areas: i) variant interpretation from metastatic and post-treatment samples for discovery of therapeutic resistance mutations (Aim 1); ii) multi- sample analysis across anatomic space, and/or time series data from serial biopsy or cell free DNA to track and model clonal dynamics (Aim 2); iii) single cell approaches for clonal decomposition and clone-specific phenotyping within patients (Aim 3). Our team is well positioned to carry out our objectives having developed leading software infrastructures supporting TCGA and clinical sequencing through MSK-IMPACT, development of clinically approved assays for longitudinal monitoring of patients through cell free DNA sequencing (MSK- ACCESS) and through study of clonal evolution at bulk and single cell resolution. We will implement and improve tools to support each of these aims, including Cancer Hotspots, OncoKB, and cBioPortal for Aim 1, PyClone and fitClone for Aim 2 and CloneAlign and CellAssign for Aim 3, tailoring and customizing software to support investigations into the dynamic and evolutionary nature of human cancers. These tools comprise a software infrastructure focused on cancer evolution through variant allele interpretation, multi-sample analysis and single cell investigation. Our infrastructure will enable researchers to automate evolutionary interpretation of disease dynamics to better understand the clinical end points of metastatic progression and therapeutic resistance. Narrative: The MSK Genomic Data Analysis Center for Tumor Evolution will create a software platform for analysis of DNA mutations in cancer to help researchers and clinicians better understand why cancers often relapse. As cancer is a disease that changes at the cellular level over time, with some cells killed by treatment while others survive, we need to understand which mutations lead to treatment failure in specific patients. We expect that with improved tools that can measure, monitor and interpret changes in disease over time, we will make advances that allow for better management of cancer and prevention of relapse.",The MSK Genomic Data Analysis Center for Tumor Evolution,10301939,U24CA264028,"['Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', '

"Comprehensive analysis of point mutations in cancer PROJECT SUMMARY Precision medicine in cancer, a disease of the genome, relies on a deep and comprehensive understanding of the genetic mutations and abnormalities that accumulate in normal cells and drive transformation to cancer. The Getz and Rheinbay Labs have expertise in the discovery and characterization of point mutations through rigorous cancer genome analysis. In this proposal, we aim to create a Genome Data Analysis Center (GDAC) focused on employing our existing tools to robustly and comprehensively characterize point mutations (single-nucleotide variations and small indels) across the entire cancer genome to address scientific questions related to biological underpinnings of cancer that arise in each project we are assigned. We also have the flexibility to adapt our tools as deemed necessary by the unique needs of each project. Specifically, we plan to integrate and characterize mutations, mutational signatures, and other data types to comprehensively discover cancer drivers in coding and non-coding regions of the genome, including the often ignored more difficult-to-analyze regions of the genome. We will do this by incorporating methods to determine DNA methylation signatures as well as by interrogating the epigenome in both coding and non-coding regions of the genome. We further plan to advance our ability to determine trajectories of tumor evolution and heterogeneity by adapting our PhylogicNDT suite of tools to analyze the evolution, subclonal heterogeneity, and timing and order of mutational events from multiple samples (e.g., samples acquired longitudinally or spatially) from the same patient, or even from cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from non-invasive blood biopsy. In the interest of advancing the GDC’s goal of improving personalized medicine, we teamed with expert clinicians and translational scientists, Dr. Keith Flaherty and Dr. Kirsten Kübler, that will interpret our findings, associate them with clinical data and direct them towards clinical impact. They will also enhance our tools for identifying the tissue- and cell-of-origin of cancers to not only better understand the underlying mechanisms of transformation in a particular cancer type or subtype but also provide more effective therapeutic targets. Moreover, our final Aim is to perform patient-specific analysis to improve and enable precision medicine, especially in patients whose tumors do not have any identified actionable driver events. Here, we will employ machine learning techniques to build predictive models of therapeutic vulnerabilities. Overall, we offer primary competencies in DNA point mutation characterization, analysis of cfDNA, and determination of mutational signatures to the GDAN. We also bring added value with secondary competencies in methylation analysis (in the context of mutational signatures), mRNA analysis, single-cell RNA sequencing, and pathway/integrative data analysis. Bringing our extensive expertise to the various newly assembled Analysis Working Groups and collaborating with other GDACs within the GDAN can help to answer outstanding questions in cancer with the ultimate goal of improving diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment for every cancer patient. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cancer is a disease of the genome and arises due an accumulation of mutations that drive normal cells to become cancerous. As a Genome Data Analysis Center (GDAC) with expertise in discovering and characterizing point mutations in the cancer genome, we aim to integrate our state-of-the-art rigorous tools and pipelines for robust point mutation characterization and driver discovery into the Genome Data Analysis Network (GDAN) alongside other GDACs with expertise in complementary fields. Understanding the significance of the point- mutation drivers in the context of analyses from other GDACs in the GDAN will provide the cancer field with a deep, comprehensive understanding of many

"Phylogenetic approaches to the quantification and serilization of variants enabling cancer theraputic resistance and the reconstruction of etilogically relevant ancestral states PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cancer progression is an evolutionary process, enabling tumors to evade our best therapeutics and, ultimately, to recur and metastasize. The evolution of therapeutic resistance remains enigmatic in part because it must be reconstructed from patient biopsies which are prescribed by patient care, rather than from design to empower discovery. Some mechanisms of resistance in select cancer-therapy systems have been discovered, but this knowledge is the result of extensive work and is subject to obsolescence as therapeutic strategies themselves evolve, necessitating systematic approaches to reveal how therapy is subverted. Our goal is to leverage tumor phylogenies to examine the evolutionary forces operating on variants responsible for therapeutic resistance. To expose the timing of specific SNVs and quantify their contribution to therapeutic resistance, I will perform deconvolution of selection from the underlying mutation rate on therapy-exposed branches of tumor phylogenies to obtain cancer effect sizes for SNVs in the context of therapy. I employed this approach in a preliminary analysis of EGFR L850R-driven, erlotinib-treated lung adenocarcinoma, and it revealed that the EGFR T790M mutation in has a vast effect size—roughly 45× higher in the context of therapy than the L858R mutation driving primary progression has during primary progression. The results support molecular and clinical observations that EGFR T790M confers strong erlotinib resistance and suggest vulnerability of EGFR L850R-driven cancer lineages to simultaneous, orthogonal treatments. Application of this method to less well characterized cancer-therapeutic systems will enable detection of currently unknown enablers of resistance. Development of these approaches to illuminate the evolutionary dynamics of therapeutic resistance will reveal the series and timing of mutations enabling resistance. To fully utilize this knowledge, we will perform analyses of somatic variant epistasis on cancer chronograms, resolving the gene interactions and evolutionary trajectories that lead to therapeutic resistance. Further, we will learn from convergences in the mechanisms of therapeutic resistance, modifying a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to the Bayesian reconstruction of cancer chronograms, to quantify—on average—the time until specific mutations reach high frequency. Finally, we will develop synergistic phylogenetic and machine-learning strategies that characterize the etiology of unobservable ancestral features of cancer. For instance, our initial analysis of a lung adenocarcinoma patient receiving erlotinib preceded by cisplatin found that platin-induced mutational signature peaked on the same branch of the phylogeny as the EGFR c.2369C→T substitution causing the T790M resistance mutation, suggesting that preceding erlotinib therapy with cisplatin can supply exactly the genetic heterogeneity needed by the tumor to evade erlotinib therapy. These approaches will also extend to evolutionary changes of other clinical features on which we will perform similar ancestral reconstructions on gene expression, neoantigens, and exome sequencing, illuminating myriad other aspects of the evolutionary context of therapeutic resistance. PROJECT NARRATIVE The progression of cancer, including the acquisition of therapeutic resistance and the mortality-inducing metastatic spread of therapy-resistant cell populations, is fundamentally an evolutionary process. To contribute to the development of effective treatments against this evolving scourge, I will leverage phylogenetics, statistics, and machine learning techniques to quantify the effects of genetic variants responsible for therapeutic resistance, resolve the timing of their occurrence, and understand their genetic and developmental trajectories within cancer subtypes. These essential insights obtained will illuminate the mechanistic evolution of therapeutic resistance in the selected systems while creating a general and powerful framework for understanding resistance to future therapies.",Phylogenetic approaches to the quantification and serilization of variants enabling cancer theraputic resistance and the reconstruction of etilogically relevant

"Imaging signatures of genetic mutations in glioblastoma using machine learning Glioblastoma (GB) is the most common and aggressive malignant adult brain tumor, with grim prognosis and heterogeneous molecular and imaging profiles. Although the currently applicable treatment options (i.e., surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy) have expanded during the last 20 years, there is no substantial improvement in the OS rates. The major obstacle in treating GBM patients is the heterogeneity of their molecular landscape. Determination of molecular targets requires ex vivo postoperative tissue analyses, which are limited in assessing the tumor's spatial heterogeneity (sampling error due to single sample histopathological and molecular analysis) and temporal heterogeneity (not possible to continuously assess the molecular transformation of the tumor during treatment). Herein we propose to develop quantitative imaging phenomic (QIP) markers of a range of mutations of interest in GB. We will build on prior work on EGFR, IDH1 mutations and MGMT methylation QIP signatures, and develop an extensive panel of imaging signatures of 10 gene mutations, as well as MGMT promoter methylation, using machine learning methods applied to relatively routine clinical mpMRI (standard plus diffusion tensor and perfusion protocols). Availability of such biomarkers can contribute to non-invasive i) patient stratification into appropriate treatments, ii) measurement of individual molecular characteristics. In particular, we propose to carry out the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1 (SA1): To develop the enabling methodologies for constructing Quantitative Imaging Phenomic signatures of GB mutations Specific Aim 2 (SA2): Establish QIP signatures of 10 mutations of interest in gliomas, plus MGMT promoter status, using next generation sequencing (NGS). We will use 709 datasets. Specific Aim 3 (SA3): Characterize the molecular heterogeneity of GB using QIP signatures, leveraging the NGS samples of SA1, as well as a new sample that we will genotype, adding to a total of 600 tumor samples obtained from 4 different locations per patient from 150 patients. The first 150 tissue samples are already analyzed as part of ongoing work. Specific Aim 4 (SA4): Integrate our methods into the Cancer Imaging Phenomics Toolkit (CaPTk), in order to allow easy access to them by users This project will investigate the relationship between imaging characteristics of glioblastoma and its underlying genetic mutations/variants. As such, it aims to develop a number of imaging signatures of mutations that are important in GBM, using 1,159 (709 patients plus an additional 450 tissue samples of 150 of these patients obtained from different locations in the tumor) analyzed via next generation sequencing. The primary motivation of this work is to develop the imaging analytics methodologies and associated biomarkers that will allow us to evaluate the spatial, temporal and molecular heterogeneity of glioblastoma, thereby assisting in patient stratification and treatment.",Imaging signatures of genetic mutations in glioblastoma using machine learning,10067573,R01NS042645,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Atlases ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Biopsy ', ' Brain Neoplasms ', ' Brain Neoplasia ', ' Brain Tumors ', ' tumors in the brain ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diffusion ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Glioblastoma ', ' Grade IV Astrocytic Neoplasm ', ' Grade IV Astrocytic Tumor ', ' Grade IV Astrocytoma ', ' glioblastoma multiforme ', ' spongioblastoma multiforme ', ' Glioma ', ' Glial Cell Tumors ', ' Glial Neoplasm ', ' Glial Tumor ', ' Neuroglial Neoplasm ', ' Neuroglial Tumor ', ' glial-derived tumor ', ' neuroglia neoplasm ', ' neuroglia tumor ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Methylation ', ' Motivation ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Phenotype ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' radio-therapy ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ', ' EGF Receptor ', ' EGFR ', ' ERBB Protein ', ' Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Kinase ', ' Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinase ', ' Epidermal Growth Factor-Urogastrone Receptors ', ' HER1 ', ' TGF-alpha Receptor ', ' Transforming Growth Factor alpha Receptor ', ' Urogastrone Receptor ', ' c-erbB-1 ', ' c-erbB-1 Protein ', ' erbB-1 ', ' erbB-1 Proto-Oncogene Protein ', ' erbBl ', ' proto-oncogene protein c-erbB-1 ', ' Sampling Errors ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Spatial Distribution ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant -

"Evolutionary Human Genomics: Demography, Natural Selection, and Transcriptional Regulation To be fully understood, the human genome must be considered in the context of evolution. The activities that have dominated human genomics for three decades — such as genome sequencing and annotation, interrogation with high-throughput biochemical assays, and the identification of associations between genetic variants and diseases — have been enormously informative, but these descriptive studies must eventually be understood within the theoretical framework of evolutionary genetics. We must continue to press forward from the what? to the why? and how? of human genetics.  The goal of my laboratory is to interpret high-throughput genomic data from an evolutionary perspective. Drawing from ideas and techniques in molecular evolution, population genetics, statistics, and computer science, we aim both to understand the evolutionary forces that have shaped human genomes, and to use evolution to shed light on the phenotypic importance of particular sequences. Our recent activities have focused in three major areas: (1)  reconstruction  of  features  of  human  evolution  based  on  genome  sequences;  (2)  prediction  of  the  fitness consequences  of  human  mutations;  and  (3)  the  study  of  transcriptional  regulation  and  its  evolution  in primates.   We have reported major findings in each of these areas, including the existence of gene flow from early modern humans to Eastern Neandertals, a map of fitness consequences for mutations across the human genome, and an analysis showing that the architecture of transcription initiation is highly similar at enhancers and promoters in the human genome.  Here we propose to extend our research substantially in each of these areas, working together with a broad range  of  experimental  and  theoretical  collaborators.    Our  new  goals  include  the  development  of  improved methods for reconstructing human demography, with a focus on ancient gene flow; extensions of our ancestral recombination graph (ARG) sampling methods to accommodate much larger samples sizes, with applications in association mapping and the detection of natural selection; two complementary machine-learning approaches for  improving  the  prediction  of  fitness  consequences  from  sequence  data;  an  experimental  collaboration  to leverage CRISPR-Cas9 screens in characterizing noncoding mutations; a multi-pronged study of the sequence determinants of RNA stability and their implications for the evolution of transcription units; and development of a new probabilistic model for turnover of regulatory elements.  Together, these projects will address a wide variety of fundamental questions about the function and evolution of sequences in the human genome. Vast quantities of genomic data are now available to describe patterns of genetic variation within  human populations and across species, and various measures of biochemical activity along the human  genome. These data need to be interpreted in light of the fundamental forces of mutation,  recombination, natural selection, and genetic drift that have shaped genetic variation. This  proposal describes a series of projects that make use of new computational, statistical, and  theoretical methods to address fundamental questions in human evolutionary genetics, including how  humans arose   from our archaic hominin and ape cousins, how human populations diverged from one  another, how new mutations influence human health and fitness, and how regulatory sequences  contribute to unique aspects of human biology.","Evolutionary Human Genomics: Demography, Natural Selection, and Transcriptional Regulation",10107826,R35GM127070,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Demography ', ' Evolution ', ' Genes ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Laboratories ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Modernization ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pongidae ', ' Apes ', ' great ape ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Genetic Recombination ', ' DNA Recombination ', ' Recombination ', ' Research ', ' statistics ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Measures ', ' Enhancers ', ' Natural Selections ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Biochemical ', ' Series ', ' Sample Size ', ' Collaborations ', ' Molecular Evolution ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' computer science ', ' Human Biology ', ' Graph ', ' Reporting ', ' RNA Stability ', ' Sampling ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genetic Differentiation ', ' Genetic Divergence ', ' Genetic Drift ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' Transcription Initiation ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Address ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' reconstruction ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' Population ', ' genome annotation ', ' genome analysis ', ' human genomics ', ' CRISPR screen ', ' CRISPR editing screen ', ' CRISPR-based screen ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 screen ', ' clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats screen ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' genetic condition ', ' genetic disorder ', ' ']",NIGMS,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R35,2021,479215,NY-03
"A combined computational and experimental approach to the evolution and role of the DNA sequence environment in targeting mutations to antibody V regions Project summary There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how mutations are preferentially targeted to the variable (V) regions of the Immunoglobulin (Ig) loci during somatic hypermutation (SHM). The persistence of this gap has limited our understanding of the mutagenic mechanisms involving activation-induced deaminase (AID) in the immune response and in the role of AID in mis-targeting mutations leading to B-cell lymphomas and other cancers. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to understand the global targeting of mutations in immunity that are required to protect us from infections. As high-throughput data from human antibody immune responses became available, it provided us with new opportunities to generate hypotheses to explain the underlying mechanisms of SHM. We now propose to generate further hypotheses using computational models applied to additional databases and to validate these hypotheses using cellular and animal experiments. Our objective is to understand what directs SHM across the many human Ig heavy chain V-regions. Our central hypothesis is that the V-region SHM process is highly dependent on a DNA sequence signature(s) that drives mutations in a largely deterministic fashion. This hypothesis is supported by our preliminary results using human in vivo data from a few human V region genes and has begun to be validated using independent databases and experiments in human B cell lines. The rationale is that evaluations of computational data based upon biological mechanisms, together with appropriate biological experiments, will reveal the key differences between IGHV regions (IGHV 3-23, 4-34, 1-18, 1-02, etc.) that lead to the dominance of each of those V regions in the responses to medically important antigens. Our hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) identify the extent to which a DNA signature determines the mutation process in four individual human IGHV genes that are important in disease responses; 2) examine the relationship between AID hotspots and Polη hotspots across all the other human V region genes, thus rigorously defining a mutation targeting signature. Both aims will also entail studying human V region genes and modifications of them in human cell lines and in mice expressing a human V region to further confirm the signature and identify molecular mechanisms in vivo. Our approach is innovative because the computational models we are proposing will be mechanistically motivated focusing on the interaction between AID and Polη hotspots, thus testing molecular mechanisms as opposed to classic statistical models using whole V region sequences that ignore the underlying biology. In addition, to focus on mechanisms we will leverage new high-throughput data from human V regions that have not undergone antigen selection. Our results will be highly relevant to human IgV repertoire analyses from immune responses that are currently hard to interpret and will help future vaccine and therapeutic antibody development, as well as help to understand mutations in human malignancies where AID plays a key role. Project narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the targeting of AID-mediated mutations across many human heavy chain V-regions will make it possible to develop vaccines that will lead more rapidly to better and more broadly protective antibodies to infectious agents and reveal the risk factors in the development of B-cell malignancies and gastric and other solid tumors where AID is implicated.",A combined computational and experimental approach to the evolution and role of the DNA sequence environment in targeting mutations to antibody V

"Comprehensive mapping of trafficking and functional robustness in Inward Rectifier K+ channels for variant pathogenicity prediction and model-guided engineering of chemogenetic reagents Project Summary Inward Rectifier K+ channels (KIR) play key roles in the operation of cells in neuromuscular and other tissue. Pathogenic variants are linked to numerous neurological, cardiovascular, and metabolic disorders. Although some variants cause gating defects in KIR by altering ligand regulation or ion permeation, there is growing evidence that many –perhaps most– variants cause defects in folding and trafficking of KIR. Despite the central role for folding and trafficking in the disease etiology, there have been to date no comprehensive large-scale studies that determine sequence and structural determinants of KIR trafficking and functional robustness. Here we provide the first comprehensive assessment of missense and topological mutations’ effects on KIR trafficking and function. Acquisition of these data is the required first step to build quantitative biophysical model of the sequence, structure, and function relationship in KIR. These models will be useful to understand the mechanistic basis for KIR mutation phenotypes, to predict their pathogenicity, and to identify new treatment strategies for KIR- linked disorders. These models will also pave the way for rational engineering of KIR as chemogenetic reagents that can be used to study functional roles of K+ channels in intact tissues.

"Predicting Transcriptional and Epigenetic Networks in Cancer from Sequencing Data Limitless replicative potential is a key hallmark of cancer and critically depends on telomere maintenance. Many cancers thus aberrantly reactivate the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), a catalytic subunit of the telomerase complex that elongates telomere. It has been recently discovered that this common path to immortality in multiple cancers is through two activating point mutations in the TERT promoter (TERTp), found in more than 50 different cancer types, often at strikingly high frequencies, e.g. roughly 83% in glioblastomas (GBM) and 71% in melanomas. In the previous funding period, the PI has identified the molecular function of these highly recurrent mutations, demonstrating that the transcription factor (TF) GABP binds the mutant TERTp with exquisite specificity, but not the wild-type TERTp. The high prevalence of TERTp mutations across multiple cancer types and the selectivity of GABP recruitment to mutant TERTp thus provide an unprecedented opportunity for treating a large number of cancer patients with minimal toxicity to healthy cells. Despite the clear significance of this opportunity, however, several important questions surrounding the molecular functions and modulators of TERTp mutations remain poorly understood, hindering the development of effective and safe therapeutic strategies.  Our long-term goal is to establish a rigorous computational framework for understanding the aberrant transcriptional and epigenetic networks in cancers and to apply the resulting knowledge to devise novel therapeutic strategies that account for the genetic background of individual patients and that can a priori predict and avoid potential resistance mechanisms. The objective of our current renewal proposal is to develop powerful computational methods for transforming our knowledge about the non-coding TERTp mutations into an effective and safe molecular target. At the same time, the resulting methods will help resolve several outstanding challenges in the field of transcriptional gene regulation and have broad applications in cancer genomics. We will accomplish our objective my pursuing the following Aims: (1) Develop and test a computational framework for inferring sequence features that determine the distinct and shared binding patterns of paralogous TFs; (2) Develop and validate integrative tools for discovering the molecular basis of genetic interactions between germline variations and oncogenic mutations; (3) Develop and apply computational methods for studying the role of DNA helical phase between adjacent binding motifs in recruiting ETS factors to chromatin; (4) Perform a systematic genomic characterization of the effects of knocking out GABPB1L in TERTp-mutant cancer cells and healthy cells. The results of this proposal will have a broad impact on cancer research by providing powerful tools for studying paralogous oncogenic TFs and revealing novel insights into a highly promising therapeutic strategy. The proposed research will provide computational and bioinformatic resources for studying the binding pattern of paralogous oncogenic transcription factors. It will provide a computational framework for inferring the function of non-coding regulatory mutations and studying their interaction with common genetic variants. As an important application, we will systematically analyze a novel therapeutic strategy that has the potential to treat effectively a large number of patients across multiple cancer types harboring the recently discovered TERT promoter mutations.",Predicting Transcriptional and Epigenetic Networks in Cancer from Sequencing Data,10054960,R01CA163336,"['Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Drug resistance ', ' drug resistant ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' Family ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genome ', ' Glioblastoma ', ' Grade IV Astrocytic Neoplasm ', ' Grade IV Astrocytic Tumor ', ' Grade IV Astrocytoma ', ' glioblastoma multiforme ', ' spongioblastoma multiforme ', ' Goals ', ' knowledge of results ', ' melanoma ', ' Malignant Melanoma ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Patients ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase ', ' EC 2.7.7.49 ', ' RNA Transcriptase ', ' RNA-Dependent DNA Polymerase ', ' Reverse Transcriptase ', ' Revertase ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Work ', ' c-myc Genes ', ' c myc ', ' cmyc ', ' v-myc Avian Myelocytomatosis Viral Oncogene Cellular Homolog ', ' telomere ', ' Family member ', ' Mediating ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' Telomerase ', ' Point Mutation ', ' base ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Somatic Mutation ', ' dimer ', ' mutant ', ' Isoforms ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Telomere Maintenance ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' EST2 ', ' TCS1 ', ' Telomere Reverse Transcriptase ', ' telomerase catalytic subunit ', ' TERT gene ', ' Address ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' DNA mutation ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' genomic alteration ', ' DNA Sequence Alteration ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Knock-out ', ' Knockout ', ' resistance mechanism ', ' resistant mechanism ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cancer genomics ', ' oncogenomics ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' anticancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' cancer type ', ' Oncogenic ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' therapeutic target ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic strategies ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' individual patient ', ' recruit ', ' bioinformatics resource ', ' bio-informatics resource ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2021,326483,IL-13
"The fitness effects of de novo structural variants PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposal for the NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) focuses on the training of Dr. PingHsun Hsieh to become an independent investigator of large-scale genomics and human population genetics. Dr. Hsieh is a population geneticist by training, and the proposed studies will advance his training into long-read- based sequencing technologies and novel machine-learning approaches to study the fitness consequences of new mutations, with a focus on structural variants (SVs), in humans and nonhuman primates. Another essential piece will be the development of resources on which types of new SVs are most likely to be pathogenic and hence most worth further effort by medical researchers. The methods developed in this work will enable other researchers to do more hypothesis-free analysis of SVs in disease etiology. Specifically, the training program will center on the study of the distribution of fitness effects of new SVs in human and nonhuman primates using high-quality SV calls and genotypes from several large-scale long- and short-read sequencing projects. The mentored work will take place under the supervision of the primary mentor, Dr. Evan Eichler, and the co-mentor, Dr. Sharon Browning, both at the University of Washington (UW). The mentor and co-mentor are well-established experts in the characterization of genomic variations using high-throughput technologies and the development of stochastic modeling methods for large-scale genetic data, respectively. Dr. Hsieh will also gain advice from a formal advisory committee as well as through activities arranged by the Department of Genome Sciences (GS), which is an optimal place for the mentored training providing the candidate with access to outstanding scientists in areas including genetics of model organisms, disease, population genetics, and the development of high-throughput genomic technologies. While found in nature and yet generally deemed to be deleterious given their size, SVs can be beneficial, and thus, the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of new SVs (i.e., the relative frequencies of beneficial, neutral, and deleterious SVs) remains elusive. In the proposed studies, we will infer the DFE of new SVs and other variants to assess their relative importance in nature, which in turn helps prioritize variants (e.g., SVs vs. single- nucleotide variants [SNVs]) in medical genetics. Specifically, in the K99/R00 phases we will (1) infer the DFE of new SVs and SNVs using a diverse panel of ~100 long-read and ~4,000 short-read high-coverage human and nonhuman primate genomes; (2) compare the DFE of new mutations among primates using contemporary and ancient DNA genomes; and (3) study the fitness effects and selective constraints on diseases in different mutation categories in large cohorts of >20,000 genomes. The skills learned in this proposal are on the cutting-edge and are tailored for the candidate to amass a great amount of knowledge in new areas of genomics, which will be applicable to many organisms and diseases and critical to the candidate’s future independent laboratory. NARRATIVE Understanding the relative abundance of beneficial, neutral, and deleterious mutations in different variant categories (e.g., genic vs. intergenic) provides useful guidance and resources for biomedical researchers to prioritize disease-causing mutations and strategize their efforts. To date, however, little effort has been made to study the full spectrum of fitness effects of new structural variants – an important but largely underappreciated genomic variation. The work proposed here seeks to leverage long-read sequencing technologies and develop novel machine-learning approaches to quantify the fitness effects of new mutation, with a focus on structural variants, and subsequently delineate the relative importance among different types of mutations in genetic diseases.",The fitness effects of de novo structural variants,10153859,K99HG011041,"['genomic science ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' genomic locus ', ' gene locus ', ' genetic locus ', ' Affect ', ' Award ', ' Communities ', ' Demography ', ' Diploidy ', ' Diploid ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Evolution ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Genetic Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Parents ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' pressure ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Public Health ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Natural Selections ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' base ', ' biomedical resource ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' Sample Size ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' QTL ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' cohort ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' human population genetics ', ' tech development ', ' technology development ', ' trait ', ' Base Pairing ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' single nucleotide variant ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' high throughput technology ', ' Genomics ', ' Genetic Differentiation ', ' Genetic Divergence ', ' Genetic Drift ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' genome sequencing ', ' fitness ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' copy number variant ', ' copy number variation ', ' Copy Number Polymorphism ', ' Data ', ' Resource Development ', ' Phylogenetic Analysis ', ' Phylogenetics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Instruction ', ' genome wide association study ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' disease-causing mutation ', ' biological systems ', ' genomic variation ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' genetic condition ', ' genetic disorder ', ' genome sciences ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2021,132244,WA-07
"Physics-based precision medicine: computationally phenotyping myosin isoforms and cardiomyopathy mutations PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Myosins are a diverse and ubiquitous class of molecular motors that are responsible for generating much of the macroscopic force in the human body. The human genome encodes 38 different isoforms of myosin, and members of this group act as force sensors or generators for a diverse set of processes throughout the body. To serve this wide array of functions, each myosin isoform has been biophysically tuned for its physiological role. In fact, the tuning is so precise that missense variants in one myosin isoform, !-cardiac myosin, can cause a congenital cardiomyopathy that is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death in people under 30. And yet, it is unknown how particular variants cause disease, or how to infer the pathogenic potential for novel mutations.  Large differences in functional properties between myosin isoforms are not the result of large differences in coding sequence or overall topology. Neither foreknowledge of phylogeny nor crystal structure is sufﬁcient to predict an isoform's biophysical properties. Furthermore, mutations causing disease frequently occur in regions of the protein far from the site of their deleterious effects. Poor understanding of the biophysical regulation of motor function has hampered the development of pharmaceuticals and the interpretation of human genomic data.  My goal is to establish a mechanistic understanding of myosin motors that is capable of predicting if and how sequence variation changes biophysical properties and can cause cardiac disease. Since myosin kinetics are not apparent from sequence or overall structure, they must be determined by other factors. I hypothesize that kinetic differences result from differences in the allosteric networks in these proteins. Allosteric network in this context refers to the coordinated conformational ﬂuctuations that give protein regulation the appearance of action at a distance. To test this hypothesis, we will use our unique combination of enormous computational power for molecular simulation and cutting-edge machine learning tools for analyzing protein allostery.  Aim 1 is to identify the biophysical determinants of myosin isoforms' differing speeds. To test our hypothesis that allosteric networks are responsible for modulating dynamics, I will use molecular simulations of different myosin isoforms and compare their allosteric networks with biochemical data about their properties. Aim 1 directly addresses outstanding questions about normal molecular-biological function of the heart, putting it in line with NHLBI overarching objective #1.  Aim 2 is to determine the difference, at atomic resolution, between healthy and diseased !-cardiac myosin. I hypothesize that the pathogenicity of variants with an unknown molecular etiology is a consequence of allosteric disruption, and will use our computational tools to test this hypothesis by simulating a set of known-pathogenic variants. This aim uses techniques from data science to understand the genetic determinants of health, and will apply equally well to rare alleles in under-represented groups as to majority groups. It is directly addresses NHLBI overarching objectives #3, #4, and #7. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Myosins are a closely-related group of molecules that are responsible for generating much of the force in the human body, including the heartbeat, the movement of limbs, and driving food through the stomach and intestines. Small changes to the myosin genes can have large effects: in healthy people, these give rise to different myosins that perform different functions, and mutations in some myosin genes can give rise to diseases that cause of sudden cardiac death. This proposal aims to learn, at the level of atoms and interatomic bonds, why and how these subtle changes to the myosin gene can create such large effects in the protein's function.",Physics-based precision medicine: computationally phenotyping myosin isoforms and cardiomyopathy mutations,10087552,F30HL146052,"['Actins ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Behavior ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Catalysis ', ' Chemistry ', ' Crystallization ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Genes ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Intestines ', ' Intestinal ', ' bowel ', ' Kinetics ', ' Learning ', ' Membrane Proteins ', ' Membrane Protein Gene ', ' Membrane-Associated Proteins ', ' Surface Proteins ', ' Methods ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Myosin ATPase ', ' Actin-Activated ATPase ', ' Myosin Adenosine Triphosphatase ', ' Myosin Adenosinetriphosphatase ', ' Myosins ', ' Phenotype ', ' Phylogeny ', ' Physics ', ' Proteins ', ' Relaxation ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Solvents ', ' Stomach ', ' gastric ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Measures ', ' sudden cardiac death ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Biochemical ', ' heart function ', ' cardiac function ', ' function of the heart ', ' insight ', ' Human body ', ' Human Figure ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Msec ', ' millisecond ', ' Techniques ', ' limb movement ', ' Molecular Dynamics Simulation ', ' molecular dynamics ', ' Isoforms ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' Molecular Motors ', ' Ran 2 ', ' rat Ran-2 antigen ', ' rat Ran 2 protein ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Appearance ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Myocardial Diseases ', ' Myocardial Disorder ', ' Myocardiopathies ', ' myocardium disease ', ' myocardium disorder ', ' Cardiomyopathies ', ' genetic determinant ', ' Genetic Determinism ', ' Cardiac Muscle Myosins ', ' Cardiac Myosins ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Affinity ', ' Data ', ' Drug Binding Site ', ' Motor ', ' Protein Analysis ', ' Protein Region ', ' Resolution ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' protein function ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' prototype ', ' disease-causing mutation ', ' rare variant ', ' rare allele ', ' biophysical properties ', ' biophysical characteristics ', ' biophysical characterization ', ' biophysical measurement ', ' biophysical parameters ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' Patient risk ', ' Data Science ', ' Congenital cardiomyopathy ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' under representation of groups ', ' under represented groups ', ' under represented populations ', ' underrepresentation of groups ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' force sensor ', ' ']",NHLBI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,F30,2021,50520,MO-01
"Predicting and analyzing variation in cellular interactomes Project Summary Over the last two decades, significant experimental efforts have determined large sets of “reference” interactions for humans and other model organisms, along with substantial knowledge about the binding specificities of proteins, including for a large fraction of human transcription factors (TFs). The resulting data have proven to be an incredibly useful resource for understanding how cells function; nevertheless, they do not capture how molecular interactions and networks are different from the reference across individuals. Indeed, while human genomes in both healthy and disease populations are rapidly being sequenced, the corresponding individual-specific interaction networks remain largely unexamined; this represents a major gap in our knowledge, as mutations that alter molecular interactions underlie a wide range of human diseases. Further, the substantial amount of genetic variation across populations makes it infeasible in the near term to experimentally determine per-individual interaction networks. Thus our long-term goal is to develop computational methods to uncover whether and how mutations within coding and non-coding portions of the genome perturb cellular interactions and networks. Our specific aims are: (1) We will develop computational structure-based approaches to identify and catalog, at proteome-scale, variations within proteins that are likely to impact their ability to bind with DNA, RNA, small molecules, peptides or ions, thereby providing a comprehensive resource for analyzing protein interaction variation. (2) We will develop novel structure-based and probabilistic methods to predict how DNA-binding specificities are altered when a TF is mutated; since mutated TFs have been linked to numerous diseases, this will be a great aid in understanding disease networks and pathology. (3) We will develop new methods to uncover non-coding somatic mutations that alter human regulatory networks in cancer; this is a critical step towards ultimately uncovering patient-specific cancer networks. Overall by pursuing these aims—which integrate mutational information with existing knowledge about reference interactions, interfaces and specificities—we will develop novel computational methods that will significantly advance our understanding of molecular interactions perturbed in disease and healthy contexts. Narrative The proposed research will yield new software tools that predict whether specific genetic mutations alter molecular interactions and networks. Since many human diseases are caused by mutations that affect molecular interactions, this research will expand our understanding of the underlying basis of disease and will provide new avenues for diagnosis and treatment.",Predicting and analyzing variation in cellular interactomes,10112245,R01GM076275,"['Affect ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Amino Acid Sequence ', ' Primary Protein Structure ', ' protein sequence ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Ions ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Peptides ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Specificity ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' Mutagenesis ', ' Genetics-Mutagenesis ', ' Mutagenesis Molecular Biology ', ' Zinc Fingers ', ' Zinc Finger Domain ', ' Zinc Finger Motifs ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Protein Binding ', ' bound protein ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Knowledge ', ' catalog ', ' Catalogs ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' Somatic Mutation ', ' preference ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Proteome ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' DNA Binding Interaction ', ' DNA bound ', ' DNA Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' small molecule ', ' DNA-Protein Interaction ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' DNA mutation ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' genomic alteration ', ' DNA Sequence Alteration ', ' Data ', ' Mutate ', ' Protein Analysis ', ' Ligand Binding ', ' cancer genome ', ' cancer cell genome ', ' tumor genome ', ' virtual ', ' Population ', ' human disease ', ' tumor ', ' disease-causing mutation ', ' predictive tools ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' Infrastructure ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,312660,NJ-12
"Computational evaluation of the causal role of somatic mutations in human aging Project Abstract Although genome instability has long been considered as one of the major causal factors of aging, little is known about the actual number of genome alterations per cell and their effects on aging organisms, most notably humans. In the research proposed here I will take a single cell approach to identify the most common types of somatic mutations, i.e., base substitutions, small INDELS, copy number variation, genome structural variation and retrotranspositions, in human B lymphocytes as a function of age. The overarching goal is then to estimate functional effects of these DNA mutations accumulated during human aging in this particular cell type, which will also serve as a model for studying somatic mutations and their consequences in other cell types. This could never be tested before, because it was never possible to analyze random somatic mutations in a tissue by sequencing bulk DNA from that tissue (mutations are low- abundant), I will achieve this goal by utilizing a new, single-cell, whole genome sequencing (SCWGS) protocol that we developed. In this project I will focus on human B lymphocytes from individuals varying in age from about 30 to over 100 years and determine the genome-wide frequency and location of the different types of mutations in multiple cells from each individual (Aim 1). Preliminary results already show a significant increase of both base substitution mutations and CNVs with age, with a substantial number of these mutations in B cell genomic regions that are potentially functional. Hence, in Aim 2 I will predict the actual functional effects of these potentially functional, age-related mutations using machine learning approaches and integrative network analysis. Finally, in Aim 3 I will empirically test these predictions as to whether the mutation loads observed affect B cell's ability of response to stimulus. Hence, to test the long-standing hypothesis of genome instability as a causal factor in aging ,I will determine age-related mutations in single cells at four levels: (1) number of mutations, mutation spectra and genome distribution in individual cells; (2) potential functional effects of individual mutations, i.e., non-synonymous mutations in exons and mutations in gene regulatory regions; (3) mutations collectively affecting the gene regulatory network; and (4) relationship between mutation load and B cell activation status. In summary, the results of the proposed project will, for the first time uncover possible direct functional effects of somatic mutations on cellular function. Project Narrative Genome instability is considered as one of the major factors of aging and age-related diseases. This research aims to study somatic DNA mutations in normal blood cells (B lymphocytes) of humans of different ages and evaluate the functional effect of these mutations. It will dramatically improve the knowledge of DNA mutations in aging and deepen the understanding of genome instability as a basic aging mechanism in human.",Computational evaluation of the causal

"PROTEAN-CR: Proteomics Toolkit for Ensemble Analysis in Cancer Research Project Summary Understanding protein–ligand molecular interactions is fundamental to understanding the role of proteins in complex diseases such as cancer. For instance, there is growing interest in predicting the binding modes of peptide-based ligands (e.g., cyclic and phosphorylated peptides) to inhibit or induce targeted degradation of high-proﬁle cancer targets. Another promising example is the identiﬁcation of tumor-associated antigens for cancer immunotherapy applications. Both examples involve very speciﬁc molecular interactions, provide opportunities for computer-aided design of better cancer treatments, and highlight the need for structural analyses in cancer research. They also require new methods that account for the ﬂexibility and variability of the protein receptors involved in these molecular interactions. The objective of this project is to develop an integrated approach to the structural modeling and analysis of protein–ligand interactions in cancer research that will be implemented in the proteomics toolkit PROTEAN-CR. The proposed toolkit will adopt a data-science approach to the problem by introducing approaches for data acquisition and aggregation, as well as algorithmic advances for handling receptor ﬂexibility and for modeling driver mutations, drug-resistance polymorphisms, and post-translational modiﬁcations. PROTEAN-CR will streamline running structural analyses at scale while providing meaningful data analytics. The long-term goal of our research is to fully integrate three-dimensional structural information about proteins and ligands and structural analysis into cancer research. The PIs will work with collaborators to target a wide range of users, from experimentalists with little to no programming experience, to advanced users who are comfortable scripting large-scale analyses and integrating the toolkit with their own computational pipeline. The central hypothesis is that a uniﬁed data-science-inspired approach can be used to address major challenges in structural analysis of protein–ligand interactions in cancer research at scale. The ﬁrst aim will incorporate protein ﬂexibility in docking studies for cancer research. Speciﬁc workﬂows will be used to generate ensembles of protein conformations (receptor ﬂexibility) and innovative machine learning methods will be implemented aiming at a better scoring of protein–ligand complexes. The second aim will focus on including cancer variability into structural analysis.

"Elucidating sequence, structural and dynamic basis of the functional regulation of membrane proteins Project Summary The overall aim of the research is Shukla group is to develop computational methods that facilitate investigation of rare conformational transitions in proteins and help guide the design of experiments to validate the in silico predictions. In par- ticular, we apply these computational methods to investigate functional regulation of membrane proteins such as membrane transporters and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Here, we propose development of transfer learning based methods to predict the effect of mutations on protein function and apply these methods to investigate monoamine transporters, sugar transporters and Class C GPCRs. Deep mutagenesis, whereby tens of thousands of mutational effects are determined by combining in vitro selections of sequence variants with Illumina sequencing, is an emerging technology for indirectly interrogating and observing protein conformations in living cells; the solving of an integrative structure of a neuronal class C G protein-coupled receptor in an active conformation by deep mutagenesis-guided modeling is one prominent example of this approach's success. Using deep mutagenesis and molecular dynamics simulations to inform each other, we plan to determine the mechanism of ion- coupled neurotransmitter import by monoamine transporters at atomic resolution. Fluorescent substrates have enabled us to use ﬂuorescence-based sorting of libraries of transporter mutants to ﬁnd mutations along the entire permeation pathway that increase or decrease substrate import. These comprehensive mutational landscapes will be used to interpret and support/reject hypotheses from simulations, including the role of ion-coupling in substrate transport regulation, proposed free energy barriers in the conformational-free energy landscape that limit import kinetics, and how sodium-neurotransmitter symport is coupled by a shared cytosolic exit pathway. Other notable features that arise from the deep mutational scans (e.g. putative regulatory sites) will be further explored, and a machine learning algorithm will be applied to transfer mutagenesis information to related transporters; the predicted mutational landscapes will then be validated by a small number of informative targeted mutants. We will further relate sequence to conformation and activity in metabotropic neurotransmitter receptors and sugar transporters. Finally, we plan to improve the proposed transfer algorithms by using deep learning techniques, which will facilitate integration of features derived from simulation datasets and multiple deep mutational scans to inform the effect of mutations on related proteins or tasks. The success of the proposed research program of results will be measured by development of algorithms that can accurately predict the variant effects on protein structure and function, elucidation of the mechanisms of ion-coupled regulation of neurotransmitter transport, selectivity mechanisms in sugar transporters and activation mechanisms of class C GPCRs. Narrative Advanced computational methods are needed to obtain comprehensive mechanistic understanding of the regulation of substrate transport via membrane transporter proteins. The research projects pursued in the PI's lab employ a synergistic combination of experiments, computational modeling and data-driven approaches to investigate neurotransmitter and sugar transporters.","Elucidating sequence, structural and dynamic basis of the functional regulation of membrane proteins",10275155,R35GM142745,"['Structure ', ' simulation ', ' G Protein-Complex Receptor ', ' G Protein-Coupled Receptor Genes ', ' GPCR ', ' G-Protein-Coupled Receptors ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Emerging Technologies ', ' Emergent Technologies ', ' protein function ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Coupled ', ' Coupling ', ' conformational conversion ', ' conformational transition ', ' mutation screening ', ' mutation scanning ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' deep learning ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' in silico ', ' algorithm development ', ' Algorithms ', ' Carrier Proteins ', ' Transport Protein Gene ', ' Transport Proteins ', ' Transporter Protein ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Fluorescence ', ' In Vitro ', ' Ions ', ' Kinetics ', ' Libraries ', ' Membrane Proteins ', ' Membrane Protein Gene ', ' Membrane-Associated Proteins ', ' Surface Proteins ', ' Methods ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurotransmitters ', ' Nerve Transmitter Substances ', ' Protein Conformation ', ' Proteins ', ' Neurotransmitter Receptor ', ' Neurohumor Receptors ', ' Neuromediator Receptors ', ' Neuroregulator Receptors ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sodium ', ' Na element ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' Measures ', ' Mutagenesis ', ' Genetics-Mutagenesis ', ' Mutagenesis Molecular Biology ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Ion Cotransport ', ' Symport ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' sugar ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Techniques ', ' Membrane Transporters ', ' Membrane Transport Proteins ', ' Molecular Dynamics Simulation ', ' molecular dynamics ', ' mutant ', ' neurotransmitter transport ', ' protein structure function ', ' success ', ' monoamine ', ' Free Energy ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R35,2021,354588,IL-13
"Novel Use of Genome Information to Understand Mutations There are significant advantages from translating genome sequences into proteins, where there is a large body of accumulated knowledge regarding their relationships among sequence, structure and function. Advances in genome sequencing are producing a deluge of data that can be used to train and test prediction methods to identify the characteristics of various mutants by building atop the large functional protein data. Clinicians need to know the functional behavior of mutants - whether they are neutral or deleterious - whether they affect protein structure – whether they affect protein dynamics - whether they affect protein binding specificity. Protein structures have local environments for each amino acid in the sequence, and usually amino acids at each position are compatible with their local environment. This leads to strongly correlated amino acids as manifested in the multiple sequence alignments. This project will combine protein sequence and structure data together with amino acid properties and their correlations to characterize each site in the protein structure to investigate the hypothesis that outliers in the distributions over the important amino acid properties for each position will negatively impact functionality, i.e. they will be deleterious mutants. The project will drill down deeply to learn what is the nature of the impaired mechanism. Two diverse approaches will be taken in the two aims: Aim 1 will investigate the amino acid property distributions to identify the properties that best characterize each position in the sequence and structure, and determine how the outliers negatively impact the functional structures, dynamics and binding characteristics. Preliminary results show that the deleterious mutants usually have a significantly broader range of single amino acid properties for the deleterious mutants. Data from these analyses will be fed into Aim 2 where two type of machine learning approaches – Extreme Learning Machines and Random Forests will be jointly applied. Preliminary results show that incorporating just one amino acid property yields significant gains over existing methods. One of the major strengths of this project is that results from the two Aims will be exchanged frequently to achieve improved predictions for both approaches. The project builds on the long experience of the PIs in datamining from protein structures and sequences, as well as previous machine learning applications. Important potential outcomes include a more reliable, more informed understanding of how mutants affect function. In addition, the project aims to predict connections of mutants to specific diseases. The results of the project will be important for drug development, because the specific part of the protein where function is impaired will be identified, to allow drug developers to narrow their focus onto more limited parts of a protein that is targeted for drug design. The predictors established by this project will also have the potential to screen for large numbers of previously unknown mutations that could be used to identify specific regions of a protein structure susceptible to further disease-related mutations. Individualized medicine in the future will need to know exactly what specific mechanisms are affected by each individual disease mutant. This project will develop that information from the computational assessments of the effects of any possible mutation by building upon the knowledge that will be mined from the large number of genome sequences, interpreted in terms of functional proteins. The results will impact the selection of drugs for individual patients, the design of more effective drugs developed by narrowing the focus to the specific parts of a targeted protein that will be identified as being responsible for adversely affecting mechanism. The project will provide quantitative predictors of the potential adverse effects of mutants on specific mechanisms and will organize relevant data and predictions into readily accessible databases, to provide important new information to the practitioners of individualized medicine.",Novel Use of Genome Information to Understand Mutations,10303852,R01HG012117,"['Affect ', ' Amino Acid Sequence ', ' Primary Protein Structure ', ' protein sequence ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Behavior ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug Design ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Genome ', ' Gold ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Probability ', ' Proteins ', ' Quantitative Evaluations ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Sequence Alignment ', ' sequencing alignment ', ' Normal Range ', ' Normal Values ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Protein Binding ', ' bound protein ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Amino Acid Substitution ', ' experience ', ' mutant ', ' user friendly computer software ', ' user friendly software ', ' Missense Mutation ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Property ', ' drug development ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' genome sequencing ', ' protein structures ', ' proteins structure ', ' protein structure ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Protein Dynamics ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' protein function ', ' Output ', ' disease phenotype ', ' cost ', ' protein structure prediction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' human disease ', ' screening ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' individualized medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapeutic strategy ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' individual patient ', ' random forest ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' ']",NHGRI,IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,480608,IA-04
"Synergistic integration of topology and machine learning for the predictions of protein-ligand binding affinities and mutation impacts Project Summary Fundamental challenges that hinder the current understanding of biomolecular systems are their tremendous complexity, high dimensionality and excessively large data sets associated with their geometric modeling and simulations. These challenges call for innovative strategies for handling massive biomolecular datasets. Topology, in contrast to geometry, provides a unique tool for dimensionality reduction and data simplification. However, traditional topology typically incurs with excessive reduction in geometric information. Persistent homology is a new branch of topology that is able to bridge traditional topology and geometry, but suffers from neglecting biological information. Built upon PI’s recent work in the topological data analysis of biomolecules, this project will explore how to integrate topological data analysis and machine learning to significantly improve the current state-of-the-art predictions of protein-ligand binding and mutation impact established in the PI’s preliminary studies. These improvements will be achieved through developing physics-embedded topological methodologies and advanced deep learning architectures for tackling heterogeneous biomolecular data sets arising from a variety of physical and biological considerations. Finally, the PI will establish robust databases and online servers for the proposed predictions. Project Narrative The project concerns the integration of topological data analysis and machine learning architectures for the predictions of protein-ligand binding affinities and mutation induced protein stability changes from massive data sets.

"Reverse Sensitivity Analysis for Identifying Predictive Proteomics Signatures of Cancer Title: Reverse Sensitivity Analysis for Identifying Proteomics Signatures of Cancer Abstract Cancer is a complex disease in which genetic disruptions in cell signaling networks are known to play a significant role. A major aim of cancer systems biology is to build models that can predict the impact of these genetic disruptions to guide therapeutic interventions (i.e. personalized medicine). A prominent driver of cancer cell growth is signaling pathway deregulation from mutations in key regulatory nodes and loss/gain in gene copy number (CNV). However, current mathematical modeling approaches do not adequately capture the impact of these genetic changes. Reasons for this include the poorly understood layers of regulation between gene expression and protein activity, and limitations in most modeling and protein measurement technologies. In addition, there is a paucity of overarching hypotheses that can link specific gene expression or mutation patterns to the cancer phenotype. Recent work by our group has resolved some of the technical challenges that have hindered the application of proteomics technologies to cancer systems biology research. It has also suggested a new approach for using quantitative proteomics data to understand mechanisms driving cancer cell behavior. Using an ultrasensitive, targeted proteomics platform that can measure both abundance and phosphorylation of proteins present at only hundreds of copies per cell, we found that signaling pathways appeared to be controlled by only a limited number of key nodes whose activity is tightly regulated through low abundance and feedback phosphorylation. We propose to build on these findings by critically testing the hypothesis that CNV and genetic mutations dysregulate signaling pathways in cancer by shifting control from tightly regulated nodes to poorly regulated ones. This will be done by systematically identifying key regulatory nodes of normal and cancer cells using CRISPRa/i screens, determine the relationship between protein abundance and signaling pathway activities using ultrasensitive targeted proteomics and phosphoproteomics and then use these data to semi-automatically generate mathematical models of the functional topology of the signaling pathways. Specifically, we propose to: 1) Use targeted CRISPR gene perturbation libraries to identify the regulatory topologies of signaling pathways important in cancer and how they are disrupted by common cancer mutations, 2) Use the CRISPR perturbation and proteomics data to semi-automatically build predictive models of cancer cell signaling pathways, and 3) Combine modeling and perturbation screens to understand how feedback regulation in cancer contributes to drug resistance. This work will result in simplified, computationally tractable yet mechanistic models of signaling pathways and provide network maps of feedback and crosstalk circuits that can be used to rapidly map the regulatory state of cells. Most important, it will provide a generic platform for translating protein abundance and phosphorylation patterns into a “state” snapshot of cancers that can lead to predicting their response to specific drugs. Narrative Cancer is an extremely complex disease which is frequently caused by signaling pathway deregulation from genetic mutation or loss/gain in gene copy number. Modern analytical techniques have provided a wealth of data on the molecular changes associated with cancer mutations, but it has been extremely difficult to use this information to design targeted therapies. We propose a new methodology that combines CRISPR-based targeted screens, advanced proteomics technologies, and a new mathematical modeling approach for identifying proteomics signatures of altered signaling pathways in cancer that can be used to build predictive models and explore mechanisms of drug resistance.",Reverse Sensitivity Analysis for Identifying Predictive Proteomics Signatures of Cancer,10148720,U01CA227544,"['Affect ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Behavior ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug resistance ', ' drug resistant ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Feedback ', ' Flow Cytometry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometries ', ' Flow Cytofluorometry ', ' Flow Microfluorimetry ', ' Flow Microfluorometry ', ' flow cytophotometry ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Libraries ', ' Maps ', ' melanoma ', ' Malignant Melanoma ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Modernization ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Phenotype ', ' Phosphorylation ', ' Protein Phosphorylation ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' Reagent ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt ', ' AKT ', ' Akt protein ', ' Protein Kinase B ', ' RAC-PK protein ', ' c-akt protein ', ' proto-oncogene protein RAC ', ' proto-oncogene protein akt ', ' rac protein kinase ', ' related to A and C-protein ', ' base ', ' Gene Dosage ', ' Gene Copy Number ', ' Link ', ' Measurement ', ' Genetic ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Gene Alteration ', ' Gene Mutation ', ' Protein Gene Products ', ' Gene Proteins ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Proteomics ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Normal Cell ', ' Address ', ' Systems Biology ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' DNA mutation ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' genomic alteration ', ' DNA Sequence Alteration ', ' Data ', ' Mutate ', ' Predictive Cancer Model ', ' Cancer Cell Growth ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' cancer type ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' cell behavior ', ' cellular behavior ', ' screening ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' CRISPR ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' Breast Epithelial Cells ', ' mammary epithelial cells ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' Breast Cancer cell line ', ' Breast tumor cell line ', ' phosphoproteomics ', ' phospho-proteomics ', ' CRISPR library ', ' CRISPR-based library ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 library ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats library ', ' proteomic signature ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NCI,BATTELLE PACIFIC NORTHWEST LABORATORIES,U01,2021,597684,WA-04
"The adaptive potential of translational regulation Project Summary/Abstract  Our current understanding of the adaptive effects of mutation is largely limited to alterations in protein coding sequence and disruption of transcriptional cis-regulatory promoters. Very little is known about how mutations alter translation, or the role these mutations play in adaptation and evolution. This project seeks to address this gap by identifying the functional effect of mutations on translation. To accomplish this I will first identify mutations that arise from adaptation to various nutrient limited environments. I will then use expression profiling (e.g. RNA-seq, ribosome profiling, and RATE-seq) to identify the effect these mutations have on translation, as well as other levels of gene expression. This will provide insight into the magnitude of effect mutations have on translation and their relative rate. Furthermore, to fully characterize the role synonymous mutations have on fitness I will be using a deep scanning synonymous mutation library. To understand the role tRNA abundance plays in the fitness effect of a given synonymous mutations, I will also be evaluating fitness within tRNA under- and over-expression backgrounds. Because of the closely coupled nature of translation rates and mRNA decay, I will also characterize the effect synonymous mutations have on mRNA decay using RATE-seq. My analysis of the functional effects of these mutations on gene expression, particularly within the genetic background and environment in which they arose, will allow for the development of a machine learning algorithm that can use sequence and annotation features to predict the effect of a mutation on gene expression. This tool will aid future research into the effect mutations have of gene expression by allowing the identification of high-confidence candidates for further evaluation.  This project will be conducted at New York University’s Center for Genomics and Systems Biology, whose mission is to answer otherwise intractable biological questions using applied experimental and computational approaches. The Center houses numerous facilities and cores that will be instrumental in the performance of this work. The collaborative atmosphere and multi-disciplinary nature of NYU’s research communities that will enable me to stay abreast of developments in related fields and to rapidly communicate my research to interested parties. I will be trained under the guidance of Dr. David Gresham, an excellent researcher working on complementing long-term evolution experiments with gene expression studies to characterize the adaptive potential of the regulation of gene expression. Project Narrative The translation of mRNA into protein is a critical step in gene expression that is tightly regulated with mis-regulation of translation being a hallmark of many human pathologies.

"Determining the role of LSD1 in multiple myeloma through a multi-omics approach at single cell resolution PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Multiple myeloma (MM) kills nearly 13,000 people annually in the United States1. MM is preceded by a less life- threating blood condition, which is similar to MM, yet non-lethal and asymptomatic2. in fact, most people don’t even know they have it. An outstanding question in MM research is why some patients diagnosed with the precursor condition go on to develop the full disease and why others do not. This question has been approached from a genetics standpoint, however there is no clear genetic link defining who goes on to develop MM from a precursor condition and who does not. Bone marrow creates a microenvironment to support developing blood cells. Multiple myeloma hijacks the bone marrow microenvironment (BMM) to favor its own growth3. Without a genetic driver of cancer development, I hypothesize that the BMM is modified epigenetically to facilitate the selective growth of MM. Epigenetics encompasses that which influences the expression of genes without altering the genes themselves. Chromatin regulators (CRs) are proteins that mediate epigenetic changes through altering the ability of a cell to express a given gene. CRs carry out this process through modifying the histone proteins around which genes are wrapped (histones and DNA taken together comprise chromatin, hence: chromatin regulators). In addition to these very specific functions, CRs can also mediate interactions with transcription factors (TFs), the proteins that turn the expression levels of genes up or down. A specific CR LSD1, which is known to repress or turn off genes, has been the target of other blood cancer diseases and drugs designed to block LSD1 activity are quite effective in models of acute myeloid leukemia (AML)45. These drugs work by disrupting an interaction between LSD1 and another protein. When that interaction is disrupted, a master TF is able to turn on genes that cause AML cells to die5. Despite some similarities between AML and MM, treatment with LSD1-targeting drugs actually enhances the growth of MM6. Interestingly, a small subset of patients have been found to be predisposed to MM development through a heritable set of mutations in LSD1 – these mutations mimic mutations that confer drug resistance in AML5,6. While these mutations only make up a small fraction of MM cases, it points to LSD1 as a key component in the development of MM7. I thereby hypothesize that LSD1 plays a role in the progression of MM; this role is potentially specific to the BMM. The specific aims of this project can be summarized as follows:  1. Develop a computational tool using novel techniques from machine learning and mathematics to learn  about factors that drive the BMM to contribute to the progression of MM.  2. Collect BMM samples from patients across a spectrum of MM development to analyze single cell gene  expression and chromatin accessibility data to learn the ways in which the epigenome is altered as MM  progresses in the BMM. PROJECT NARRATIVE Multiple myeloma is a lethal cancer preceded by well-defined pre-myeloma conditions that are asymptomatic and non-lethal, though the transition between these precursor states and overt multiple myeloma is poorly understood. The bone marrow microenvironment is thought to be altered in patients that progress from pre- myeloma to overt multiple myeloma and a better understanding of this tissue’s involvement in disease development may highlight opportunities for therapeutic intervention prior to the development of overt multiple myeloma. This project aims to analyze single cells from the bone marrow microenvironment across a spectrum of patient disease development, as well as construct a novel computational architecture, to learn about the drivers of this oncogenic transformation.",Determining the role of LSD1 in multiple myeloma through a multi-omics approach at single cell resolution,10154128,F31CA257625,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Cells ', ' Peripheral Blood Cell ', ' Bone Marrow ', ' Bone Marrow Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' cell growth ', ' Cellular Expansion ', ' Cellular Growth ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Drug Design ', ' Drug resistance ', ' drug resistant ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Hematology ', ' Histones ', ' Learning ', ' Acute Myelocytic Leukemia ', ' AML -

"A pan-cancer atlas of driver mutations in >100,000 patients based on a hypothesis-driven combined computational and experimental approach PROJECT SUMMARY Most mutations in cancer genomes are random passengers that do not contribute to oncogenesis, whereas only a few are drivers critical for tumor development. Existing cancer therapies interfere directly with the biology of drivers, which have been characterized extensively in protein-coding regions but remain largely uncharacterized outside coding regions. Most tumors harbor a combination of several driver mutations, but it is unclear how multiple events are coordinated in tumor development. The applicant's long-term goal is to advance cancer medicine by identifying new drug targets and clinical markers for therapies in complex pathways. The overall objectives in this application are to (i) reveal the biological role of noncoding drivers, (ii) capture the coordination of driver events at a pathway level, and (iii) profile the effects of noncoding drivers on cancer gene expression. The central hypothesis is that refining the biological assumptions of computational methods will enhance their statistical power. The rationale is that defining the biology of noncoding drivers and their combination will offer a strong foundation for new therapies. The central hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: 1) Determine the impact of integrating biological mechanisms into statistical methods for localizing noncoding drivers; 2) Evaluate mechanisms by which promoter mutations increase the expression of cancer genes; and 3) Assess the coordination of multiple driver events in tumor development. The proposed research is innovative, in the applicant's opinion, because it will allow for an unbiased characterization of driver mutations across the entire genome, address the limitations of existing cancer genomics methods in noncoding regions, and facilitate the usage of statistical concepts for non-computational scientists. The proposal is significant because it will enable a systematic interrogation of noncoding drivers and their combinations. Ultimately, this will pave the way for new targeted therapies. Dr. Dietlein will be mentored by Dr. Van Allen, an Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School with considerable experience in cancer genomics methods that require statistical innovation for clinically focused questions. His co-mentor, Dr. Meyerson, is a Professor of Genetics and Medicine at Harvard Medical School and a pioneer in developing targeted therapies based on driver mutations. Additional support will be provided by 4 computational and 2 experimental collaborators. Dr. Dietlein's training plan contains four goals, which will be pursued by hands-on experiential training, conference meetings, and structured coursework: 1) Acquire computational skills for interpreting drivers in noncoding regions; 2) Experimental techniques to validate driver mutations by CRISPR interference; 3) Develop professional leadership skills for interdisciplinary teams of scientists; and 4) Use machine-learning methods for interpreting drivers in cancer genomes. Dana-Farber, Harvard Medical School, and the Broad Institute provide an ideal environment to execute the applicant's career development plan. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it combines computational methods for defining noncoding driver mutations in whole cancer genomes with genome editing experiments to identify their biological role in tumor development. The functional characterization of these driver events will pave the way for the development of new cancer therapies and genomic markers to select the right therapy for each patient. Hence, this project will have immediate impact on the clinical interpretation of patient sequencing data and is relevant to the NIH's mission to improve the clinical care and survival of cancer patients.","A pan-cancer atlas of driver mutations in >100,000 patients based on a hypothesis-driven combined computational and experimental approach",10276520,K99CA262152,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ',

"Single-Cell Analysis of the Noncoding Genome in Human Diseases and Evolution Project Summary/Abstract  Noncoding regulatory mutations had driven human evolution since the split from chimpanzees and more than 90% of disease-associated loci reside in noncoding regions. Because gene regulation is dynamic and context dependent, functions of noncoding regulatory mutations should be defined in specific cell types and at particular developmental stages. However, such a fine-resolution mapping of noncoding mutations in human diseases and evolution has been lacking in the literature, and this proposal aims to develop a comprehensive research program to close the knowledge gap by pushing our genome analysis to a single-cell resolution.  My recent work has developed innovative approaches for disease genome analysis and has identified key elements driving recent human evolution. Given the prime importance of the noncoding genome in human diseases and evolution, the long-term goal of my research is to identify causal noncoding mutations that affect human phenotypes by perturbing gene regulation. Built on our recent success in capturing pathogenic noncoding somatic mutations that are predictive of prostate tumor characteristics, in the next five years, my research will push our genome analysis to a single-cell resolution. By developing a series of machine learning frameworks, we will be able to directly determine the allelic effects on altering cell-type-specific epigenomic architecture, revealing the cellular contribution to human diseases or to any evolutionary traits. Towards this goal, my laboratory is actively generating single-cell epigenome data, have obtained access to large-scale genomes for different disease categories, and have developed an innovative deep learning model achieving substantially enhanced precision for capturing pathogenic noncoding mutations.  To demonstrate the general applicability of our research framework, we will investigate rare germline mutations in prostate cancer, common variants in preterm birth, and the Neanderthal introgressed alleles in the modern human genome for their regulatory effects on affecting human brain development. These conditions have wide population prevalence, and our preliminary analyses have clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of our machine learning model on identifying consequential noncoding mutations in specific cell types. We will also build an open-access genome browser which will allow users to visualize and analyze regulatory effects of any mutations in a given cell type. Overall, the proposed program will uncover new disease mechanisms from the noncoding genome, will reveal the Neanderthal impact on brain development of modern humans, and will provide a generally applicable tool for genome analysis at a single-cell resolution. Different from conventional approaches, this proposed research by introducing single-cell analysis will directly reveal the most affected cell populations in diseases, thereby guiding the future development of therapeutic strategies targeting the affected cell types. Project Narrative Many genetic loci associated with phenotypic traits do not code for proteins but reside in noncoding regions by dysregulating gene expression. The dynamic nature of gene expression in specific cells and at particular developmental stages has prevented us from understanding noncoding mutations in human diseases and evolution. The goal of the proposed project is to introduce single-cell analysis in our human genome research: by leveraging a deep learning framework to integrate single-cell epigenomes and large-scale patient genomes, we will be able to determine the molecular context where noncoding mutations exert their pathogenic effects, and this new framework is expected to foster the development of therapeutic strategies targeting the most vulnerable cell types in human diseases. 1",Single-Cell Analysis of the Noncoding Genome in Human Diseases and Evolution,10276412,R35GM142983,"['Affect ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Evolution ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Literature ', ' Modernization ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Prostatic Neoplasms ', ' Prostate Neoplasms ', ' Prostate Tumor ', ' Prostatic Neoplasia ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Work ', ' Pan Genus ', ' Chimp ', ' Chimpanzee ', ' Pan Species ', ' Premature Birth ', ' Prematurely delivering ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' premature childbirth ', ' premature delivery ', ' preterm delivery ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Germ-Line Mutation ', ' Germline Mutation ', ' Hereditary Mutation ', ' Fostering ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' cell type ', ' Somatic Mutation ', ' single cell analysis ', ' success ', ' trait ', ' Categories ', ' Modeling ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Consequentialism ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' epigenomics ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' human disease ', ' therapeutic development ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' genome analysis ', ' epigenome ', ' genome browser ', ' deep learning ', ' genomic locus ', ' gene locus ', ' genetic locus ', ' ']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R35,2021,403750,CA-12
"Unraveling molecular and system-level mechanisms of human disease-associated protein mutations Project Summary Although a quickly expanding catalogue of protein mutations have been discovered, including those that cause human diseases or confer drug resistance, mechanistic understanding and prediction of functional consequences of these mutations remain rather limited. There is a critical need to develop novel, multiscale computational frameworks that are rigorous and generalizable to help close the ever-increasing gap between phenotypic data and mechanistic knowledge about the mutations and to develop effective therapeutic strategies.  My long-term research goals are two folds: (1) to unravel how a change in protein sequence ripples through various aspects of molecular and system-levels to a change in cellular function and cause human diseases or confer drug resistance; and (2) to translate learned mechanistic knowledge to effective drug-design strategies for human diseases and drug resistance. Toward these goals I propose to advance and combine the strengths of computational molecular biology (structural modeling and design for proteins or protein interactions) and computational systems biology (pathway/network-level topology and dynamics) and follow a novel, formal paradigm to develop methods that systematically identify mechanisms underlying various stages of consequence propagation (from conformation, molecular and system-level variables, to cellular functions, where intermediates can be skipped if necessary). In the forward direction of propagating consequences, I will determine, explain and understand mutational consequences at various levels with machine learning, causal analysis, and combinatorial optimization, starting with known or modelled changes at various levels. In the inverse direction of designing consequences, I will follow known or learned mechanistic hypotheses and develop efficient combinatorial optimization methods to design mutagenesis experiments or screen / design ligands for desired perturbations at various levels, which would test and refine corresponding hypotheses directly and translate mechanistic hypotheses to therapeutic strategies. Mechanisms underlying distal (potentially allosteric) mutations, multiple mutations within a protein or across proteins as well as systems pharmacology strategies will also be rigorously determined in the process.  The expected outcomes from the innovative project will include two main components. The first will be both biophysical principles of proteins and integrative understanding of biomedical systems, which will be organized in a database for public access. The second will be translating mechanistic insights into therapeutic intervention strategies to treat diseases. In particular, targeted experiments (mutagenesis or ligand-binding) will be designed following known or discovered mechanistic hypotheses. This project will involve close collaboration with structural biologists and clinician-scientists who are active collaborators of the PI. Project Narrative Genetic mutations, many of which lead to protein mutations, are often associated with human diseases: they often directly cause diseases or contribute to their progressions. Understanding mechanisms by which these mutations lead to significant functional consequences is of extreme importance to developing effective therapeutics to cure diseases and ameliorate drug resistance.",Unraveling molecular and system-level mechanisms of human disease-associated protein mutations,10263154,R35GM124952,"['Amino Acid Sequence ', ' Primary Protein Structure ', ' protein sequence ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug Design ', ' Drug resistance ', ' drug resistant ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' Goals ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Ligands ', ' Methods ', ' Structural Models ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Protein Engineering ', ' genetic protein engineering ', ' protein design ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Mutagenesis ', ' Genetics-Mutagenesis ', ' Mutagenesis Molecular Biology ', ' Distal ', ' insight ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' catalog ', ' Catalogs ', ' Scientist ', ' System ', ' novel ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' resistance to disease ', ' resistant disease ', ' resistant to disease ', ' Disease Resistance ', ' Computational Molecular Biology ', ' Systems Biology ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' DNA mutation ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' genomic alteration ', ' DNA Sequence Alteration ', ' Structural Biologist ', ' Ligand Binding ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' human disease ', ' Combinatorial Optimization ', ' phenotypic data ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' ']",NIGMS,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R35,2021,335245,TX-17
