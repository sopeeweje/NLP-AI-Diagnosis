"Implementing a digitally-enabled community health worker intervention for patients with heart failure Project Summary/Abstract Heart failure (HF) 30-day readmissions generate over a third of HF healthcare costs in the US and are the leading cause of US 30-day readmissions. Drivers of HF readmissions include increasing complexity associated with clinical, social, and behavioral factors. Despite numerous interventions, readmission rates remain elevated and a quarter of these could be prevented by a multidisciplinary approach promoting better connections to and communication with clinical care teams while addressing social and behavioral barriers to HF care. Community health workers (CHWs) are members of medical teams who address social, behavioral, and basic clinical factors influencing health outcomes while fostering patient connections to and communication with care teams. CHW care is one of a few interventions shown to reduce readmissions in patients with chronic disease. However, CHW care relies on intensive 1:1 patient care models that do not leverage technology which limits efficiency and scalability. There has been limited attention on developing technology-based interventions in CHW care to reduce HF 30-day readmissions. A HF mobile phone application-based digital platform that utilizes artificial intelligence driven biometric data to minimize false alarms, promotes early identification of true decline, and encourages communication with providers was developed in 2016 to reduce HF 30-day readmissions. Preliminary clinical trial data for the digital platform has been promising. A prototype designed for patients with HF and the CHWs caring for them has recently been created. The current proposal will assess the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of a digitally-enabled CHW intervention to reduce HF 30-day readmissions. Aim 1: Identify behavioral (e.g., diet, activity) and social (e.g., socioeconomic status, social supports, living situation) factors that influence HF outcomes relevant to a digitally-enabled CHW intervention by performing semi-structured interviews with 30 patients with HF and 20 CHWs. Aim 2: Test usability of a digitally- enabled CHW intervention (focused on CHW workflow integration) in 10 patients with HF in an open pilot trial. Aim 3: Assess the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of implementing a digitally-enabled CHW intervention compared to CHW care to reduce HF 30-day readmissions within a pilot RCT (n=50). The candidate’s overall career goals are: to identify social and behavioral drivers of HF/cardiovascular clinical outcomes; to develop expertise in qualitative methods, behavioral science, and RCTs; and ultimately, to develop interventions that improve care and reduce costs in HF/cardiovascular disease and other NHLBI diseases seen by generalists. This training plan includes strong mentorship, formal coursework, and scientific meetings with cohesive training in behavioral and social sciences, qualitative research, and the conduction of RCTs. This proposal investigates a potentially transformative intervention that addresses important gaps in the literature by assessing the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of a digitally-enabled CHW intervention in reducing 30-day readmissions and improving patient engagement. Project Narrative: Despite ongoing efforts to improve outcomes in heart failure (HF), a leading cause of mortality and elevated healthcare costs, 30-day HF readmission rates remain elevated and a quarter of these are preventable. Community health worker (CHW) care delivery has been shown to improve healthcare outcomes but inefficiency limits its scalability. Implementation of a 30-day digitally-enabled CHW intervention for HF patients may provide support for similar interventions in larger HF/cardiovascular populations by reducing 30-day readmissions and improving patient engagement.",Implementing a digitally-enabled community health worker intervention for patients with heart failure,10084315,K23HL150287,"['Affect ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Attention ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' community health worker ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' General Practitioners ', ' Generalists ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentorship ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Patient Care Team ', ' Patients ', ' Pneumonia ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Singapore ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Technology ', ' Telemetry ', ' Telemetries ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' medical costs ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Fostering ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' experience ', ' cohesion ', ' care delivery ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' Structure ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' member ', ' social ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' cardiac research ', ' Heart Research ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' pilot trial ', ' cost ', ' implementation research ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' usability ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' prototype ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic strategies ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' clinical care ', ' effective intervention ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' improved outcome ', ' health difference ', ' differences in health ', ' barrier to care ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' readmission rates ', ' hospital re-admission rates ', ' hospital readmission rate ', ' re-admission rates ', ' re-hospitalization rate ', ' rehospitalization rate ', ' care outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' patient engagement ', ' participant engagement ', ' social factors ', ' comparison intervention ', ' compare intervention ', ' ']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2021,198857,MA-08
"PREcision Care In Cardiac ArrEst - ICECAP (PRECICECAP) Project Summary The objective of PREcision Care In Cardiac ArrEst - ICECAP (PRECICECAP) is to discover novel biomarker signatures of post cardiac arrest brain and extracerebral organ failure that predict treatment responsiveness and long-term recovery. We will achieve this by partnering with the ICECAP trial, a response-adaptive dose finding clinical research trial that seeks to determine the optimal duration of post-arrest hypothermia. Cardiac arrest is a major public health problem with high morbidity and mortality. Four in five patients hospitalized after cardiac arrest have significant brain injury, and death from neurologic damage is common. Improving survival and functional recovery is a critical public health objective and will require innovative approaches. The current clinical situation is unprecedented. Currently post-CA brain injury is an acute, sudden critical illness with major knowledge gaps about how best to characterize severity of injury and to identify which individual patients are likely to benefit from specific neuroprotective strategies. Thus, development of high- performing biomarker signatures is a critical need and would translate in to immediate changes in care. We hypothesize that not all patients are identical (i.e. there will be a heterogeneity of treatment effect) and that through our innovative, multi-parametric data driven approach, we will be able to identify novel signatures that define subgroups of patients. Advanced data science and analytical approaches will allow the identification of these subgroups that was previously not possible. These subgroups will be clinically important insofar as they will indicate differential responses to treatment and different trajectories of functional recovery. This project will acquire high resolution multi-modal data early in the disease course that will allow us to address these current knowledge gaps and improve our understanding of the disease in the early acute setting when interventions can improve outcome. The knowledge learned here will be applied to develop personalized treatments for cardiac arrest survivors, addressing the NIH's and our goals of lengthening life and reducing disability. Project Narrative Post-cardiac arrest injury affects the brain and other critical organs and is a major public health problem causing significant death and disability. This project will use novel data-driven approaches to collect high resolution monitoring data from patients in the critical care unit and will use that multi-parametric data to develop newly defined patient sub-groups with differing clinical trajectories and responses to therapies. This project will have a major impact on public health by allowing treatment of the right patient at the right time with the right therapy, thereby reducing disability and saving lives.",PREcision Care In Cardiac ArrEst -

"Multi-Omic Markers of Cardiac Function and Structure within the Pressure Overloaded Heart PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposed study is motivated by the public health importance of aortic stenosis (AS), a common form of valvular heart disease that is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Once symptomatic, survival is a dismal 50% at 1-year if left untreated. Clinical symptoms develop once cardiac compensatory mechanisms fail, indicating the need for aortic valve replacement (AVR), but because AS primarily affects the elderly, symptoms are often incorrectly attributed to comorbid conditions, advanced age, or both—resulting in delayed treatment. While most patients that eventually undergo AVR experience improvements in symptoms and survival, nearly half of patients die within the first year after AVR or fail to reap the symptom and health status improvements for which they underwent AVR. Our research suggests that irreversible cardiac remodeling and injury related to delayed treatment contribute to these poor clinical outcomes, highlighting the unmet need for objective and sensitive measures to inform clinical decisions regarding the timing of AVR. Our long-term goal is to develop and implement an omics-based precision medicine approach for identifying patients with severe AS at-risk for irreversible cardiac remodeling and injury who would benefit from earlier AVR, and our central hypothesis is that multi-omic signatures reflective of dimensions of cardiac structure and function will identify irreversible cardiac remodeling and therefore predict the clinical response to AVR. Our prior work and preliminary studies provide strong support for our hypothesis and demonstrate that our experienced multidisciplinary team is uniquely qualified to complete the proposed study. We have identified metabolomic signatures that relate strongly to measures of cardiac function and structure and predict mortality after AVR, and also proteomic signatures relating to cardiac function that differentiate severe AS and associate with mortality. Within this proposal, we adopt a longitudinal systems biology approach that leverages the latest in proteomic and metabolomic (multi-omic) sciences to: discover, test, and cross-validate multi-omic signatures of cardiac function and structure in patients with severe AS (Aim 1); characterize longitudinal multi-omic signatures and associations with changes in cardiac structure and function after AVR (Aim 2); and evaluate the accuracy with which multi-omic signatures predict response to AVR (Aim 3). Our approach will enable us to identify multi-omic signatures of irreversible cardiac remodeling and injury in patients with severe AS. These data will support the development of new precision medicine-based strategies for identifying patients who would benefit from earlier clinical intervention in an effort to reduce mortality and maximize health after AVR. PROJECT NARRATIVE Aortic stenosis ultimately leads to heart failure and death, but valve replacement is curative. For many patients, valve replacement is performed too late, after damage to the heart muscle is no longer reversible, resulting in persistent symptoms and increased risk for death. The goal of my research is to identify compounds within the blood that can serve as an early warning that the heart is struggling to overcome aortic stenosis and can therefore help physicians plan the optimal timing of valve replacement surgery.",Multi-Omic Markers of Cardiac Function and Structure within the Pressure Overloaded Heart,10127697,R01HL151838,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' aortic valve replacement ', ' Aortic Valve Stenosis ', ' Aortic Stenosis ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cause of Death ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Energy Metabolism ', ' Energy Expenditure ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Heart ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart Injuries ', ' cardiac injury ', ' Heart Valve Diseases ', ' Valvular Heart Diseases ', ' Valvular Heart Disorder ', ' cardiac valve disease ', ' cardiac valve disorder ', ' cardiac valvular disease ', ' degenerative valvular heart disease ', ' heart valve disorder ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Myocardium ', ' cardiac muscle ', ' heart muscle ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' pressure ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Distress ', ' heart function ', ' cardiac function ', ' function of the heart ', ' Individual ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Clinical Practice Guideline ', ' Metabolic ', ' Myocardial depression ', ' cardiac dysfunction ', ' heart dysfunction ', ' Myocardial dysfunction ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' LVEF ', ' Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction ', ' Complex ', ' Ejection Fraction ', ' EFRAC ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' LV remodeling ', ' left ventricle remodeling ', ' Left Ventricular Remodeling ', ' Structure ', ' cardiac dimension ', ' cardiac size ', ' heart dimension ', ' heart size ', ' heart dimension/size ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Proteomics ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' patient registry ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' valve replacement ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Ventricular ', ' Cardiac ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' protein metabolite ', ' Outcome ', ' Impairment ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' clinical predictors ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' predicting response ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' persistent symptom ', ' chronic symptom ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' proteomic signature ', ' predictive signature ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' classification algorithm ', ' ']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,665495,MA-08
"Clinical and Molecular Epidemiology of High Risk Coronary Plaque Although current practice focuses largely on the detection and management of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), there is marked heterogeneity in the relationship between CAD and risk for cardiovascular (CV) events. Some patients, despite having obstructive CAD, do not experience cardiovascular events, while others with non-obstructive CAD do. The mechanisms of this high risk coronary plaque (HRCP) development are incompletely understood; application of emerging imaging and molecular technologies holds great promise for simultaneously identifying underlying biological pathways, markers for early noninvasive detection, and novel therapeutic targets for HRCP. Thus, we propose to (1) determine the role of inflammation and other candidate biological pathways in the pathophysiology of HRCP; (2) identify novel biological pathways mediating development of HRCP through machine learning analyses of integrated metabolomic, proteomic and transcriptomic profiling; and (3) determine the incremental prognostic value of these imaging and molecular biomarkers over clinical factors and create an integrated clinico-molecular model of CV event risk prediction. We will accomplish these goals by, for the first time, integrating advanced CTA-based phenotyping of HRCP with molecular profiling and adjudicated CV events, leveraging the robust, existing resources of a large, unique NIH-funded clinical trial of imaging in chest pain patients (PROMISE). This proposal holds great public health significance by augmenting current population- and ischemia- based approaches and more precisely and preemptively identifying those patients at highest risk. Our findings will provide a critical foundation for the development of diagnostics and therapeutics targeted at specific, culprit atherosclerotic phenotypes and molecular pathways. Patients who develop blockages in the arteries around their hearts (termed coronary artery disease or CAD) often suffer from heart attacks and death due to these blockages. However, some patients who do not have significant CAD also suffer from these events. These patients are felt to have likely had “vulnerable” or “high risk” coronary plaque (HRCP). We do not understand well what types of patients develop HRCP or the biology as to why some patients develop HRCP. In this grant, we will analyze data on patients with and without HRCP (identified through a CT scan) who were enrolled in the PROMISE clinical trial to understand which patients develop HRCP and then analyze the blood from these patients. These studies hold potential for helping us understand and identify those patients at greatest risk of HRCP and subsequent heart attacks and death, and to evaluate the biological reasons that these patients develop HRCP.",Clinical and Molecular Epidemiology of High Risk Coronary Plaque,10219348,R01HL146145,"['Algorithms ', ' Angiography ', ' Angiogram ', ' angiographic imaging ', ' Arteries ', ' Biology ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Chest Pain ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Extracellular Matrix ', ' Cell-Extracellular Matrix ', ' ECM ', ' Arterial Fatty Streak ', ' Arterial Fatty Streaks ', ' Atheroma ', ' Atheromatous ', ' Atheromatous degeneration ', ' Atheromatous plaque ', ' atherosclerosis plaque ', ' atherosclerotic lesions ', ' atherosclerotic plaque ', ' vulnerable plaque ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Heart ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Inflammation ', ' Ischemia ', ' Lipids ', ' Cardiovascular Models ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary infarction ', ' heart attack ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart infarction ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Molecular Epidemiology ', ' Individual ', ' Coronary Stenosis ', ' Coronary Artery Stenosis ', ' Funding ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Morphology ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' cohort ', ' Molecular Modeling Nucleic Acid Biochemistry ', ' Molecular Modeling Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Molecular Models ', ' molecular modeling ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Proteomics ', ' Involuntary Muscle ', ' Smooth Muscle ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' molecular profile ', ' molecular signature ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Non-Invasive Cancer Detection ', ' Non-Invasive Detection ', ' Noninvasive Cancer Detection ', ' Noninvasive Detection ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Coronary ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' molecular imaging ', ' molecule imaging ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' neglect ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' adjudicate ', ' Population ', ' transcriptomics ', ' therapeutic target ', ' clinical epidemiology ', ' high risk ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' new drug target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new therapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' molecular marker ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' endoplasmic reticulum stress ', ' ER stress ', ' prognostic value ', ' prognostic ability ', ' prognostic power ', ' prognostic utility ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' patient stratification ', ' stratified patient ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' Inflammasome ', ' pain patient ', ' coronary plaque ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NHLBI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,1279576,NC-04
"Predicting Drug Cardiotoxicity Targets Using iPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes and Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY Drug development and approval is a costly process with nearly $2 billion spent for each drug that is approved. One of the most significant contributors to this high cost is the expense of developing drugs that fail to pass clinical trials – only 15% of drugs that begin clinical trials are approved for use on humans. A common reason for not reaching the FDA’s criteria for approval is that the drug is classified as cardiotoxic, which cannot be detected during early stages of drug development. One way that drugs can lead to cardiotoxicity is by altering the electrical activity of ion channels that are responsible for the excitation of the heart tissue that pumps blood to the body. Understanding which ion channels, and the extent to which these ion channels are affected is central to determining the cardiotoxicity of a drug. Early-stage predictions of cardiotoxicity are based on animal studies that are poor models of human heart behavior or single-cell electrophysiological studies that falsely assume underlying pathophysiology based on action potential changes. The recent development of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) offers an opportunity to study drug effects on human cells in a preclinical setting. In this study, we hypothesize that fitting a computational iPSC-CM model to voltage-clamp (VC) data acquired before and after drug application provides a means of quantifying unknown drug effects on specific cardiac ion channels. We will address this hypothesis through the following Specific Aims: 1) Use machine learning to design a novel VC protocol that improves the quality of data for hiPSC-CM model fitting. 2) Quantify the change in hiPSC-CM ion channel conductances before and after drug application. We will use machine learning to develop a novel voltage clamp protocol that improves the electrophysiology data acquired from our hiPSC-CMs. The data is optimized to improve predictions of the conductances for all ion channels activated during the cardiac action potential. We can apply this voltage clamp protocol in an in vitro setting before and after drug application, then fit our computational model to each dataset. The change in ion channel conductances, predicted by the model fit, serves as an estimate of the channel-specific effects of the drug. The contributions of this proposal will be significant because it will be the first study to use human cardiac cells to produce quantitative measurements of channel-specific drug targets that may lead to lethal cardiac arrhythmias. PROJECT NARRATIVE Many promising drugs developed to treat a variety of diseases have undesirable effects on the heart, including increased risk of sudden cardiac death. Often, these drugs are not found to have adverse effects until they reach clinical trials, and failure of drugs at this stage of development is very costly. We aim to develop a method that leverages machine learning and human stem cell-derived heart cells to predict drug cardiotoxicity in a pre-clinical setting to substantially reduce the cost of the drug development process.",Predicting Drug Cardiotoxicity Targets Using iPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes and Machine Learning,10433823,F31HL154655,"['Action Potentials ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Arrhythmia ', ' Cardiac Arrhythmia ', ' Heart Arrhythmias ', ' Behavior ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Goals ', ' Heart ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Ion Channel ', ' Ionic Channels ', ' Membrane Channels ', ' Kinetics ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Measures ', ' Drug Costs ', ' sudden cardiac death ', ' Cavia ', ' Guinea Pigs ', ' Guinea Pigs Mammals ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Drug Approval ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' blood pump ', ' improved ', ' Cardiac Myocytes ', ' Cardiac Muscle Cells ', ' Cardiocyte ', ' Heart Muscle Cells ', ' Heart myocyte ', ' cardiomyocyte ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Recovery ', ' Measurement ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Morphology ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Clampings ', ' Closure by clamp ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Equation ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' human data ', ' voltage ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' drug development ', ' voltage clamp ', ' Cardiac Toxicity ', ' Cardiotoxic ', ' Cardiotoxicity ', ' Adverse effects ', ' patch clamp ', ' heart cell ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' human stem cells ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' iPS ', ' iPSC ', ' iPSCs ', ' screening ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' Standard Model ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' human model ', ' model of human ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NHLBI,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,39636,NY-23
"Combined Cardiomyopathy, e.g., of Cancer Chemotherapeutics, and Proarrhythmia for Cardiotoxicity Clinical Trials-in-a-Dish (CTiD) with iPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes Cardiotoxicity is a leading cause of drug discovery attrition across all of preclinical and clinical drug discovery. While the FDA and the Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay initiative (CiPA) are focused primarily on predicting proarrhythmic effects, drug attrition due to cardiomyopathy, or primary cardiac cytotoxicity, may be even more prevalent, is typically currently only carried out via animal studies, and limits dosage for many cancer chemotherapeutics. Due to improving cancer survival, it is increasing common for more cancer survivors of some cancer types to die of cardiac diseases due to cancer treatment side effects than cancer recurrence. Cardiac contractions are initiated by electrical depolarizations (action potentials, APs) that propagate through the heart and initiate calcium (Ca2+) transients that activate the contractile apparatus. Importantly, dysregulation of Ca2+ can trigger inappropriate early-after- and delayed-after- depolarizations (EADs and DADs) that initiate arrhythmias, inhibit mitochondrial function, and pathologically alter expression of contractile proteins. Chemotherapy and other drugs can also directly impair mitochondrial function, which is primarily thought to cause cytotoxicity, but can also cause arrhythmias. Cardiomyocytes are also heterogeneous in their voltage, calcium, and contractile functions, and in their responses to therapeutic candidates. Thus, it is highly desirable to simultaneously measure AP, Ca2+ and contractile function on a cell- by-cell basis, in human cardiomyocytes, but this is not possible with current test methods. To address this unmet need we propose to develop a high throughput (robotic) Kinetic Image Cytometry that simultaneously quantifes voltage, calcium, and contractile motion in cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CMs). The hiPSC-CMs will be labeled with fluorescent indicators of calcium and voltage, and the cells imaged via high-speed automated microscopy during contractile activity. The use of hiPSC-CMs will enable “clinical trials” in a dish, in which test compounds are tested across cells representing several donors. Phase I of this Fast-Track STTR project will develop the basic protocol and perform a proof-of-concept screen of 30 test compounds on hiPSC-CMs representing 5 donors. In Phase II, a large validation study (~350 compounds, 7-concentration dose-response, 30 min and 72 hr exposures) will be performed. Artificial intelligence will be utilized to optimize the sensitivity and specificity of the assay by detecting complex arrhythmia waveforms. This assay represents a human-based preclinical model that will be less expensive and more predictive for cardiotoxicity testing than animal models and will be marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for contract research. FDA guidelines stipulate that all new drugs be tested for dangerous side-effects on the heart as part of preclinical research; however, the current tests are poorly predictive of both dangerous and safe drugs leading to unwarranted attrition and dangerous drugs reaching clinic. Human cardiomyocytes derived from donor tissue (iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes) are widely considered to hold great promise for clinical trial in a dish studies of drug cardiotoxicity. This STTR proposal is to commercialize a high throughput platform to accurately identify drug candidates that have cardiac side effects, in particular adding the ability to detect the type of primary heart cell damage common with anti-cancer drugs in a fully automated (high throughput) robotic assay for the first time, to improve the efficiency of preclinical research and the safety of human clinical trials, which will also likely have the added benefit of reducing animal research.","Combined Cardiomyopathy, e.g., of Cancer Chemotherapeutics, and Proarrhythmia for Cardiotoxicity Clinical

"Genetic determinants of 4D genome folding in human cardiac development PROJECT SUMMARY A major unanswered question is how chromatin topology coordinates human development and cellular differentiation, and how genome folding is differentially regulated in human disease. It is thought that three- dimensional (3D) chromatin organization is driven by transcriptional regulators, but fundamental mechanisms of this regulation as it relates to disease-relevant human cells have not been well explored. We propose to elucidate the temporally dynamic 3D nucleome (4DN) that underlies human cardiac differentiation, its molecular underpinnings, and the impact of mutations that underly defective 4DN organization in human congenital heart disease (CHD). CHDs are the most common birth defect and arise from abnormal heart development. The genetic basis of CHD is largely mutations in genes encoding chromatin modifiers (e.g. WDR5, KMT2D) and transcription factors (TFs, e.g. TBX5, GATA4), many of which also cause adult-onset arrhythmias. The impact of CHD mutations on the 4DN has not been explored. We hypothesize that 3D genome folding is highly regulated during cardiac differentiation and is impacted by disease-causing mutations in transcriptional regulators and non-coding elements. We will use iPS cell models and machine learning to elucidate dynamic 3D chromatin organization in human cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells during normal and diseased cardiac differentiation. We propose 3 specific aims: Aim 1: Establish a kilobase-scale 4D map of genome folding in human cardiomyocytes (CM) and endothelial cell (EC) differentiation. We will use directed differentiation of human iPS cells towards the two major cell types of the developing heart: CMs and ECs, and using microC across a fine time course of differentiation we will define at kilobase scale the 3D organization of the genome, capturing the states of developmental intermediates and the final differentiated cells. This aim will generate an essential integrated 4DN template for discovery in cardiac differentiation. In Aim 2: we will Determine the regulatory and disease-related basis for cardiac 3D chromatin organization. We will perform microC in iPS cell lines with CHD-associated mutations in transcriptional regulators, differentiated into CMs and ECs. These findings will establish the degree to which CHD is caused by abnormal genome folding and chromatin states, with important relevance to other human cardiovascular diseases. Finally, Aim 3 will address High-throughput screening of millions of CHD and synthetic non- coding mutations with a deep-learning model of dynamic genome folding. We will build a deep-learning model predicting 3D chromatin contact frequencies across cardiac differentiation at kilobase-resolution. By introducing thousands of CHD patient deletions and other non-coding mutations in silico, we will prioritize variants likely to interact with transcriptional regulators to cause disease through disrupted genome folding. Several candidates will be validated in engineered iPS cells differentiated into CMs and ECs. These results will provide a novel platform for computational discovery of disease variant impact across diverse human diseases PROJECT NARRATIVE Congenital heart defects are present in 1-2 out of 100 births, and are caused by mutations in genes that may control the 3-dimensional organization of chromosomes. We will use human cellular models and Artificial Intelligence to understand how chromosome organization is controlled during heart development and altered by disease processes. This will reveal fundamental concepts of gene regulation and may lead to a better understanding congenital heart defects towards improving diagnosis and treatment.",Genetic determinants of 4D genome folding in human cardiac development,10266148,U01HL157989,"['cohesin ', ' genetic determinant ', ' Genetic Determinism ', ' histone modification ', ' heart development ', ' heart formation ', ' cardiogenesis ', ' Chromatin Remodeling Complex ', ' chromatin modifier ', ' Chromatin Remodeling Factor ', ' SMARCA2 ', ' SMARCA2 gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Mutate ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Resolution ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' stem cell differentiation ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Cell model ', ' Cellular model ', ' human disease ', ' disease-causing mutation ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' Cardiac development ', ' ATAC-seq ', ' ATACseq ', ' GATA4 gene ', ' GATA binding protein 4 ', ' GATA4 ', ' GATA4 transcription factor ', ' Heart Abnormalities ', ' Cardiac Abnormalities ', ' Cardiac Malformation ', ' Cardiac defect ', ' Heart Malformation ', ' heart defect ', ' human pluripotent stem cell ', ' human model ', ' model of human ', ' deep learning ', ' computational platform ', ' computing platform ', ' in silico ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' stem cell model ', ' stem cell based model ', ' stem cell derived model ', ' Congenital Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Malformation ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Arrhythmia ', ' Cardiac Arrhythmia ', ' Heart Arrhythmias ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Chromatin ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Engineering ', ' Family ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Genome ', ' Heart ', ' Congenital Heart Defects ', ' Congenital Cardiac Defects ', ' congenital cardiac anomalies ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Histones ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Development ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Maps ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Proteins ', ' Time ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Enhancers ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' congenital heart disorder ', ' congenital cardiac abnormality ', ' congenital cardiac disease ', ' congenital cardiac disorder ', ' congenital cardiac malformation ', ' congenital heart abnormality ', ' congenital heart anomaly ', ' congenital heart disease ', ' congenital heart malformation ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Endothelial Cells ', ' Cardiac Myocytes ', ' Cardiac Muscle Cells ', ' Cardiocyte ', ' Heart Muscle Cells ', ' Heart myocyte ', ' cardiomyocyte ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' CTCF protein ', ' DNA-binding protein CTCF ', ' CCCTC-binding factor ', ' Structure ', ' Human Biology ', ' novel ', ' Chromosomal Organization ', ' Chromosomal Structure ', ' Chromosome Organization ', ' Chromosome Structures ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' High Throughput Assay ', ' high throughput screening ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' ']",NHLBI,J.

"Deciphering the Endothelial Cell-Cardiomyocyte Crosstalk in LMNA Cardiomyopathy Project Summary/Abstract Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a leading cause of heart failure and the leading reason for heart transplantation. Major gaps exist in our understanding of the pathophysiology of DCM and mutations in the gene that encodes the nuclear envelope proteins lamin A and C (LMNA) are considered to be the most common cause of DCM. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie “cardiolaminopathy” remain elusive, and it is unknown why mutations in this ubiquitously expressed gene have such a disproportionate effect on the heart. Using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSCs)-derived endothelial cells (iPSC-ECs), we recently studied a family affected by DCM due to a frameshift variant in LMNA, which showed endothelial dysfunction (Sayed et al. Science Translational Medicine, 2020). This EC dysfunction could be reversed by upregulating Krüppel-like Factor 2 (KLF2) by treatment of iPSC-ECs with a subset of statins, including lovastatin. Importantly, this improvement in EC dysfunction had a positive effect on co-cultured iPSC- cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) from cardiolaminopathy patients, indicating an intricate crosstalk between the ECs and CMs in LMNA cardiomyopathy.  Despite impressive progress, little attention has been given to the potential importance of cell-to-cell signaling between ECs and CMs, despite the fact that ECs serve a paracrine function to enhance signaling in CMs, especially in context to pharmacological stimulation. This knowledge gap impedes our comprehensive understanding of organ dysfunction at a multi-cellular level. The overarching goal of our proposal is to use a multidisciplinary approach that integrates human iPSCs, bioengineering tools, genome editing, and NGS to gain novel insights into the pathogenesis of DCM. Using human iPSCs, we propose to decipher the impaired cross-talk between ECs and CMs in LMNA cardiomyopathy and elucidate the beneficial class effects of statins in improving the EC-CM signaling as a key factor in regulating cardiac function. We will pursue three specific aims. In Aim 1: we will establish an experimental platform to study the genotype-phenotype association of LMNA mutations on ECs and CMs. For this, we will recapitulate the EC-CM crosstalk in LMNA iPSC-derived cells with 3D engineered heart tissues (EHTs). In Aim 2: we will decipher the mechanism of EC-CM crosstalk in LMNA iPSC-derived EHTs using single-cell approaches (scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq). In Aim 3: we will validate the key regulatory players of EC-CM crosstalk in LMNA cardiomyopathy by using CRISPR technology and zebrafish animal model. We have provided compelling preliminary data to support the soundness of our hypothesis-driven research proposal, and we are well positioned to achieve the project goals within five years. If successful, our studies will provide a new paradigm for understanding the pathogenesis and treatment of familial DCM. Project Narrative Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), a complex cardiac disease is a leading cause of heart failure. The emergence of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology offers an experimental human-based model to predict and model individual disease manifestations. The goal of this project is to study the underlying mechanisms of DCM by investigating the intricate crosstalk between cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells using bioengineering tools and next generation sequencing. Results from this work could potentially lead to new strategies that could lower morbidity and mortality, but also improve the management of DCM patients.",Deciphering the Endothelial Cell-Cardiomyocyte Crosstalk in LMNA Cardiomyopathy,10276748,R01HL158641,"['Affect ', ' Attention ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bio-engineered ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bioengineering ', ' Dilated Cardiomyopathy ', ' Congestive Cardiomyopathy ', ' Cardiovascular Physiology ', ' cardiovascular function ', ' Cell Communication ', ' Cell Interaction ', ' Cell-to-Cell Interaction ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Communication ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Gene Expression ', ' env Gene Products ', ' Envelope Protein ', ' env Antigens ', ' env Polyproteins ', ' env Protein ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Heart ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart Transplantation ', ' Cardiac Transplantation ', ' Heart Grafting ', ' cardiac graft ', ' cardiovascular transplantation ', ' heart transplant ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Kinetics ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Ligands ', ' Lovastatin ', ' 6-Methylcompactin ', ' Mevinolin ', ' Monacolin K ', ' mevacor ', ' Morbidity -

"Prediction of Heart Failure Onset using Multimodal Data Analysis, Deep Learning and Commercial Wearables Prediction of Heart Failure Onset using Multimodal Data Analysis, Deep Learning and Commercial Wearables Project Summary/Abstract Research: Heart failure is one of the leading causes of mortality and drivers of healthcare costs in the United States. By 2030, the number of heart failure patients is projected to reach 8 million. If we could predict who will develop heart failure, this would create an opportunity to improve patient experiences and outcomes by initiating earlier behavioral and therapeutic interventions. Electronic health records (EHR) contain information that can be used to predict heart failure before its onset. However, the existing models lead to a large number of false positive predictions, limiting their clinical utility. The PI proposes to augment the EHR data with electrocardiogram (ECG) and heart rate variability (HRV) features to improve the accuracy of predicting the onset of heart failure 12 months in advance. The three modalities of data (EHR, ECG and HRV) will be analyzed using deep learning methods, including novel techniques proposed by the PI. The models will be developed and validated retrospectively using patient data available at Michigan Medicine. The second aim of the proposal is to increase the impact of this research by replacing the clinically measured ECG and HRV with those obtained by consumer wearables such as smart watches. A prospective cohort of patients will wear a wearable device for seven days, which will allow the PI to determine whether the collected information (intermittent ECG, continuous HRV derived from photoplethysmography, and actigraphy), combined with EHR, can provide clinicians with a more effective tool to identify which patients are at risk of heart failure. While this approach will benefit a larger population of patients, it will still be limited to those with past medical history. To further expand the impact of this research to those who wear consumer wearables but have no previous medical history, a limited model that depends only on the information gathered by the wearable device will be evaluated. Thus, the outcomes of this study will include multiple models targeting various populations, such as those with and without prior medical history. Candidate / Career Development: Dr. Sardar Ansari is a computer scientist and statistician with expertise in biomedical signal processing, machine learning, and medical wearable devices. His past research experience includes analysis of ECG signal to improve detection of cardiac arrhythmias and reduce false alarms in intensive care units; detection and removal of noise and motion artifacts in biomedical signals such as ECG and bioimpedance; prediction of hemodynamic decompensation using HRV; and detection of hemorrhagic shock, intradialytic hypotension, and low cardiac index using wearable technology. This award will allow Dr. Ansari to acquire needed additional training in cardiovascular physiology and heart failure pathophysiology through mentorship, didactic training, attending workshops and scientific meetings, and clinical exposure, preparing him for an independent career focused on developing diagnostic and clinical decision support tools for cardiovascular medicine. Project Narrative Heart failure is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, but it is currently difficult to predict who will develop heart failure. In this study, we will apply machine learning and signal processing techniques to multiple types of data (electronic health records, electrocardiography, and heart rate variability) to predict heart failure onset, and we will use wearable devices to improve the predictions and expand their impact to a wider population. We expect the resulting tools will help prevent delayed diagnosis of heart failure, leading to improved medical outcomes, enhanced patient experience, and reduction in healthcare costs.","Prediction

"Effect of elevated dATP on contractile function and the Frank-Starling relationship in models of dilated cardiomyopathy Abstract  Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is the most common form of systolic heart failure with poor prognosis and no specific treatment to address the underlying contractile deficit. In addition to the loss of contractility, there is also impairment in the Frank-Starling relationship, an adaptive process that is described as the increase in contractile force in response to increased preload. We are proposing to investigate a novel therapy for DCM that addresses both loss of contractility and impairment in the Frank-Starling relationship. This novel therapy is achieved by increasing intracellular levels of 2-deoxy ATP (dATP) in cardiomyocytes via increasing the expression of the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (R1R2), the rate-limiting step in de novo dNTP biosynthesis. Increased intracellular levels dATP in cardiomyocytes increases contraction by enhancing cross-bridge binding and cycling kinetics and improving allosteric activation of contraction. Recent data suggests that in addition to improved contraction, increased dATP level also enhances the Frank Starling relationship. I will propose specific aims to assess the effect of increased dATP on the Frank Starling relationship and contraction in two animal models of DCM. In the first aim, I will use a genetic model of DCM with a D230N mutation in alpha-tropomyosin (D230N Tm). Using recombinant D230N Tm, I will test the hypothesis that this mutation reduces thin filament activation and, as a consequence, the kinetics of contractile activation and relaxation. I will then determine the effect of increasing dATP content on these deficits. Using tissue from transgenic D230N Tm mice, I will test the hypothesis that this mutation decreases calcium sensitivity of force and length-dependent activation. I will correct these functional deficits by increasing dATP content. Using AAV6-cR1R2, an adeno-associated viral vector that restricts R1R2 over-expression to cardiac myocytes, I will test the hypothesis that increasing dATP levels improves contractility of isolated cardiomyocytes, and improves systolic function in both adult and young D230N Tm mice. Similarly, I will use post-infarct model of DCM in rats to evaluate the effect of cross-bridge activation on length dependent activation (LDA)-the Frank Starling relationship at the sarcomere level. Next, I will use alternative agents to increase (dextran, EMD 50733) or decrease (BDM, beryllium fluoride, high inorganic phosphate) cross-bridge recruitment and evaluate their effect on LDA in demembranated post- infarct DCM rat trabecula. I will complete this aim by testing the hypothesis that cross-bridge activation augments LDA in human myocardium from patients with DCM. Extension Project: Use data from above studies in D230N Tm DCM rodent model to simulate realistic cardiac twitches and use machine-learning methods for parameter optimization. Heart failure, the inability for the heart to keep up with its work load, is a growing epidemic in worldwide, with high mortality despite current available medical treatments. In the most common form, the heart is dilated with reduced contractile function. We are proposing a novel mechanism to treat this problem by altering the fuel used for contraction employing the naturally occurring molecule, deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP).",Effect of elevated dATP on contractile function and the Frank-Starling relationship in models of dilated cardiomyopathy,10391887,K08HL128826,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' alpha Tropomyosin ', ' α-Tropomyosin ', ' Beryllium ', ' Calcium ', ' Dilated Cardiomyopathy ', ' Congestive Cardiomyopathy ', ' Deoxyadenosines ', ' Adenine Deoxyribonucleosides ', ' Adenylyldeoxyribonucleosides ', ' Dextrans ', ' dextran ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Epidemic ', ' Fluorides ', ' Heart ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infarction ', ' infarct ', ' Kinetics ', ' Genetic Models ', ' mortality ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Myocardium ', ' cardiac muscle ', ' heart muscle ', ' Patients ', ' inorganic phosphate ', ' Phosphates ', ' Rattus ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rat ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Relaxation ', ' Ribonucleotide Reductase ', ' Sarcomeres ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Workload ', ' Work Load ', ' tripolyphosphate ', ' triphosphate ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Anabolism ', ' biosynthesis ', ' Cardiac Myocytes ', ' Cardiac Muscle Cells ', ' Cardiocyte ', ' Heart Muscle Cells ', ' Heart myocyte ', ' cardiomyocyte ', ' Starlings ', ' Sturnidae ', ' Sturnus vulgaris ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' transgenic ', ' Transgenic Organisms ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Systolic heart failure ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Thin Filament ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Recombinants ', ' Rodent Model ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' Impairment ', ' adeno-associated viral vector ', ' AAV vector ', ' adeno-associated virus vector ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' overexpression ', ' overexpress ', ' recruit ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K08,2021,44640,WA-07
"Mechanisms of Abnormal Diaphragm and Cardiac Development Project Summary  Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a life-threatening birth defect that accounts for 8% of all major congenital anomalies. In cases where CDH co-occurs with cardiovascular malformations (CVMs), mortality rates increase from 30 to 60%, and long-term morbidity is common. Our goal is to identify genes that cause CDH and CDH/CVM, and to discover the mechanism by which they control diaphragm and heart development.  Correctly identifying genes that contribute to specific phenotypes from the large list of candidate genes data generated in research and clinical studies is a major obstacle to progress in this and other research fields. In Specific Aim #1, we will address this challenge by generating ranked CDH and CDH/CVM pathogenicity scores for all RefSeq genes using a machine-learning algorithm that integrates data from large-scale genomic knowledge sources. We will use these scores to identify novel CDH and CDH/CVM genes from cytogenetically defined critical regions and form large next-generation sequencing databases as part of our multifaceted approach to novel gene discovery. We will also accelerate the pace at which human disease genes are discovered by making these scores and our machine-learning algorithm freely available.  8p23.1 microdeletions that encompass GATA4 and SOX7 are among the most frequently identified causes of CDH/CVM. In RNA-seq studies, we identified several CDH-associated genes that are dysregulated in the E15.5 diaphragms of Gata4flox/flox;Prx1-Cre embryos. These embryos are an ideal model of the sac hernias that comprise 20% of human CDH cases. In Specific Aim #2, we will combine data from RNA-seq and BioChIP-seq analyses with the priority scores generated in Aim #1 to identify primary GATA4 target genes whose dysregulation contribute to the development of sac CDH. We will then determine if alterations in the expression of these target genes can cause CDH, or can modify the CDH phenotypes of GATA4-deficient mice.  We have shown that SOX7 deficiency causes septal defects by decreasing endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in the developing heart. In RNA-seq and in situ hybridization studies we have shown that the expression of Wnt4—a key regulator of EMT in the endocardium—is severely decreased in E9.5 Sox7-/- hearts. In Specific Aim #3 we will determine if Wnt4 is a primary target of SOX7, and whether modulation of WNT4 or its downstream effectors can rescue SOX7-related cardiac phenotypes.  Several lines of evidence suggest that WNT4 is a novel CDH/CVM gene in humans. To confirm this association, and learn more about the role of WNT4 in diaphragm and heart development, we will determine if WNT4 deficiency causes CDH/CVM in mice, if Sox7 and Wnt4 interact genetically in the development of CDH/CVM and if SOX7 regulates Wnt4 transcription in the developing diaphragm.  Through these studies we will identify novel CDH and CDH/CVM genes and pathways. The bioinformatic tools we develop in this grant will enhance gene discovery efforts across multiple research fields. Project Narrative Diaphragmatic hernias and cardiovascular malformations are serious birth defects. In this study, we will use bioinformatics and mouse models to identify genes that cause these birth defects and to learn how they work. These experiments will help us to understand how the diaphragm and heart form prior to birth and may ultimately lead to new ways of treating or preventing these birth defects.",Mechanisms of Abnormal Diaphragm and Cardiac Development,10404417,R01HD098458,"['Congenital Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Malformation ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Association Learning ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cytogenetics ', ' Respiratory Diaphragm ', ' Diaphragm ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Encyclopedias ', ' Endocardium ', ' Endothelium ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Heart ', ' Hernia ', ' Diaphragmatic Hernia ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Newborns ', ' newborn child ', ' newborn children ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Luciferases ', ' Luciferase Immunologic ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Phenotype ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Syndrome ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Work ', ' In Situ Hybridization ', ' in situ Hybridization Genetics ', ' in situ Hybridization Staining Method ', ' dosage ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Congenital diaphragmatic hernia ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' sequence database ', ' sequencing database ', ' molecular sequence database ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' biochip ', ' genome database ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' Micro RNA ', ' miRNA ', ' miRNAs ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' heart development ', ' heart formation ', ' cardiogenesis ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' WNT4 ', ' Wingless-Type MMTV Integration Site Family, Member 4 ', ' WNT4 gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Mesenchymal ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' intervention for prevention ', ' prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' preventive intervention ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' genomic region ', ' Ontology ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' epigenomics ', ' microdeletion ', ' Chromosomal microdeletion ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' malformation ', ' mouse genome ', ' human disease ', ' web based interface ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' parent grant ', ' gene discovery ', ' discover genes ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' NGS Method ', ' NGS system ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' congenital anomaly ', ' Cardiac development ', ' GATA4 gene ', ' GATA binding protein 4 ', ' GATA4 ', ' GATA4 transcription factor ', ' SOX7 gene ', ' SOX7 ', ' SRY-Box 7 ', ' septal defect ', ' septum defect ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' bioinformatics tool ', ' bio-informatics tool ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' ']",NICHD,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,121605,TX-09
"Bridging the Gap between Genomics and Clinical Outcomes in CHD PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The NHLBI has invested extensively in the Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium (PCGC), recognizing that translating genomic discoveries into optimized management and therapeutic strategies for congenital heart disease (CHD) can only be achieved in the context of multi-center, collaborative research. Currently, the PCGC is lacking two fundamental capabilities that hinder its ability to define the genomic basis for CHD outcomes: (1) a robust mechanism for extracting pertinent, machine-readable clinical data from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) across multiple institutions; and (2) a robust Artificial Intelligence (AI) platform that is capable of teasing apart the complex interplay between maternal factors, phenotypes, genotypes, gene functions and clinical outcomes. Here, we propose innovative solutions to these challenges, by assembling teams of content experts to leverage existing infrastructure to extract relevant outcomes directly from the EHR of participating PCGC Centers and by designing best-practice AI tools for outcomes research. Our principal goal is provide the vision, infrastructure and expertise to collaboratively empower CHD outcomes research, foster knowledge exchange, and train the next generation of genomic scientists. We propose to leverage existing data infrastructure to obtain Electronic Health Records (EHR) and other clinical variables at scale by partnering with other research networks to create a PCGC Data Resource. Using this resource, we will create and deploy a platform of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based predictors for CHD outcomes research, with the goal of translating genomic discoveries into improved management and therapeutic strategies for CHD.

"Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Heart Failure: A Cross Cohort Collaboration ABSTRACT Heart failure (HF), and its subtypes defined by preserved (HFpEF), reduced (HFrEF) or mid-range (HFmrEF) ejection fraction are a major and growing public health problem. The long term goal of this project is to better understand the health disparities regarding HF and define effective preventive measures that may reduce these disparities. We propose to pool data from 10 large longitudinal cohort studies to examine race/ethnic and sex disparities in developing HF, its subtypes, and its prognosis. The harmonized data will include over 130,028 men and women with over 8975 similarly-adjudicated prospective HF outcomes, representing a wide spectrum of ages, race/ethnicities, and geographic regions of the United States.

"Defining the molecular regulators of valvular delamination via multi-omic dissection of Ebstein’s Anomaly PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cardiac valves are critical to the maintenance of unidirectional blood flow in the heart. Congenital and acquired valvulopathies are a major source of morbidity and mortality in both the pediatric and adult populations. Current therapeutic strategies are limited, often requiring surgical replacement with suboptimal prostheses. Valvulogenesis begins with formation of the endocardial cushions via epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Many of the signaling pathways regulating this EMT event have been defined; however, little is known about the molecular regulators of post-EMT valvulogenesis. Ebstein’s Anomaly, a rare congenital heart defect, is characterized by variably dysplastic, muscularized tricuspid valve leaflets that are often tethered to the underlying myocardium, resulting in apical displacement of the annulus and atrialization of the right ventricle. This defect is often attributed to a failure of valvular delamination – a critical morphogenetic step of post-EMT valvulogenesis during which the primordial valve leaflets separate from the underlying myocardium. Previous studies suggest that altered differentiation dynamics of valvular interstitial cells (VICs) may contribute to the pathogenesis of this valvular defect. I propose to define the molecular regulators of valvular delamination via a multi-omic dissection of Ebstein’s Anomaly, leveraging an Ebstein’s Anomaly murine model system, primary human tissue, and human genetics data. In my first aim, I will use spatiotemporal single cell RNA sequencing and human genetics analyses to identify the atrioventricular cushion signaling interactions regulating valvular delamination. In my second aim, I will use an integrated single cell RNA/ATAC sequencing approach to define the gene regulatory networks driving VIC fate determination. My primary sponsor, Dr. Deepak Srivastava, has extensive expertise in developmental cardiac biology, human genetics, and stem cell biology. My co- sponsor, Dr. Chun (Jimmie) Ye, has an expertise in experimental and computational single cell genomics. Their collective expertise will assure that I receive the necessary training and mentorship to complete the proposed research. To obtain the rare tissue samples required for my project, I have formed a multi-center collaboration with two high volume Ebstein’s Anomaly patient centers. Additionally, I have secured expertise in human genetics and machine learning from Dr. Jingjing Li, Ph.D., in support of the human genetics component of my project. Concurrently, I am engaging in a longitudinal clinical preceptorship in pediatric cardiothoracic surgery with my clinical training co-sponsor, Dr. Peter Kouretas, Surgical Director of the UCSF Pediatric Heart Transplantation Program. Overall, the proposed research will elucidate previously uncharacterized mechanisms of late atrioventricular valvular morphogenesis and inform future efforts toward the development of novel regenerative-medicine based therapeutics for congenital and acquired valvulopathies. F30 NRSA fellowship support would foster my expertise in developmental cardiac biology and computational genomics, furthering me toward my ultimate career goal of becoming an academic pediatric cardiothoracic surgeon-scientist. PROJECT NARRATIVE The molecular regulators of valvular delamination – a critical morphogenetic step of valvulogenesis whose dysfunction underlies a rare tricuspid valve malformation, Ebstein’s Anomaly – remain largely unknown. I will apply an innovative multi-omic approach to identify the intercellular interactions regulating this morphogenetic process and define the gene regulatory networks that drive valvular interstitial cell fate determination.

"Deep Neural Networks To Treat Atrial Fibrillation PROJECT SUMMARY Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major health problem affecting over 5 million people in the US leading to significant morbidity and even mortality. Therapy for this epidemic is suboptimal, with success of 30-70% at 1 year for most therapies. Despite great advances in understanding potential AF mechanisms, these insights have not yet translated into better AF therapy. The scientific focus of the project centers on the issue of identifying novel phenotypes for the heterogeneous conditions that currently fall under the rubric of AF. Machine learning is an approach well-suited to identify novel classifications from large diverse data sets that are traditionally difficult to separate. I will use machine learning and computational methods to analyze detailed clinical, structural, cardiac electrophysiological and biochemical features in patients with AF, to better predict responders and non-responders to various therapies. This may enable prospective guidance to tailor personalized therapy. In performing this project, I will grow as a physician-scientist focused on patient-oriented research in atrial fibrillation. The specific aims of the scientific project are as follows: First, I will create a novel disease taxonomy for AF that classifies patients successfully treated by risk factor modification, antiarrhythmic drug therapy, or diverse approaches to ablation, using computational methods and supervised learning on large training data from my collaborators. I will assess the predictive efficacy of these disease partitions in a testing cohort of patients referred for treatment of AF. Second, I will use advanced techniques in machine learning and patient-level analyses to explain why a certain strategy may fail or succeed in an individual, paving the way for clinical use. Third, in a pilot prospective clinical study, I will assess the feasibility and accuracy of these machine learning models. The findings from these experiments may provide an immediate clinical impact by delivering AF therapy options in a patient-specific manner that optimizes benefit while reducing risk. In addition, under the balanced and expert mentorship provided by this award, I will gain the necessary computational modelling, clinical research design and biostatistical methodology experience to design comprehensive studies and be competitive for independent funding. PROJECT NARRATIVE Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent heart rhythm disorder in adults, which may lead to significant morbidity, mortality and economic burden. The results of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic therapy remain suboptimal, despite the fact that mechanistic data in patients are increasing on atrial structure, electrophysiology and clinical risk factors yet are rarely used to individualize AF therapy to each patient.

"SCH: INT: MyPHA: Automatically generating personalized accounts of in-patient hospitalization A growing body of research has found that patients who actively manage their health have better outcomes, and patient engagement has become a central tenet in recent healthcare approaches. However, it has also been shown that many patients lack knowledge of their disease and medications, particularly as concerns chronic health conditions, whose exacerbation causes about two thirds of hospitalizations every year in the USA. Discharge instructions after hospitalization are a critical tool to engage patients in their self-care, but are often unsuccessful. Our hypothesis is that, to en9age patients at discharge, a personalized hospitalization summary should be provided, that integrates physician and nurse documentation, and is informed by the patient's level of engagement in self-care and their socio-cultural perspective. Our transformative pilot work on physician and nurse documentation has identified an additional obstacle to the effective flow of information from professionals to patients: vocabulary differences between physicians and nurses. By leveraging the Unified Medical Language System Metathesaurus, we found no common synonyms between physician and nurse documentations for 75% of patients. Further, 86% of terms patients use are simple compared to only 15% for physicians. The lack of common language among patients, physicians and nurses motivates including all perspectives to make instructions meaningful for patients. Our hypothesis is that a better informed patient population who understands the connections between their illness, hospital experience, and discharge instructions will be more empowered and more engaged in their chronic disease management. Our innovation is to automatically create an easy-to-understand, personalized hospitalization summary that integrates events described in the EHR; and that is responsive to the patient's needs and preferences, and their activation framework (PAF) level. We pursue four specific aims: 1. To investigate socio-cultural patterns of patient perceptions of illness via a socio linguistic analysis of patient interviews; 2. To integrate multi-faceted information about a patient, as provided by physicians and nurses; 3a. To develop MyPHA, a novel application program, which will automatically generate the personalized summaries and deliver them to the patient on a tablet. MyPHA will be informed by aims 1 and 2, and will be grounded in Natural Language Generation technology; 3b. To evaluate MyPHA with multiple cycles of formative evaluation with all stakeholders, and a summative evaluation with patients. Whereas our pilot work has focused on heart failure, the techniques we will develop can easily be adapted to the management of other chronic health conditions, in particular for patients with cancer and cancer survivors. In addition, cancer and heart failure can co-occur, especially in older patients, and several cancer treatments can lead to the development of heart failure. The software program MyPHA will be released open source to the research community to enable rapid customization to other chronic conditions. Patients who are engaged in their self-care have better outcomes, however discharge instructions often fail to activate them. This study plans to integrate nurse and physician documentation from the Electronic Health Record with the patient's needs and preferences to provide patients with a concise summary of their hospitalization, tailored to their current activation level. This contextual information should help improve the lives of patients living with chronic health conditions, such as cancer patients and survivors.",SCH: INT: MyPHA: Automatically generating personalized accounts of in-patient hospitalization,10226146,R01CA225446,"['Appointment ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Behavior ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Charge ', ' Chicago ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Illinois ', ' Interview ', ' Investments ', ' Joints ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Medical Libraries ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Medical Records ', ' Mission ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Ownership ', ' Patient Discharge ', ' Discharge from Health Care Facility ', ' Discharge from Healthcare Facility ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Physicians ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Students ', ' Tablets ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Interdisciplinary Communication ', ' Cross-Disciplinary Communication ', ' Multidisciplinary Communication ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Self Management ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' Intention ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Native Americans ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' preference ', ' empowered ', ' experience ', ' socio-linguistics ', ' sociolinguistics ', ' computer science ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' empowerment ', ' member ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer-directed therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' Health Informatics ', ' consumer informatics ', ' Public Health Informatics ', ' heart development ', ' heart formation ', ' cardiogenesis ', ' Institution ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' patient cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' treatment compliance ', ' compliance behavior ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' survive cancer ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Text ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Behavioral ', ' Health Professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' health literacy ', ' Instruction ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' biomed informatics ', ' UMLS Metathesaurus ', ' Metathesaurus ', ' Unified Medical Language System Metathesaurus ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' open source ', ' illness perceptions ', ' prototype ', ' patient population ', ' natural language ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergrad ', ' undergraduate ', ' doctoral student ', ' Ph D student ', ' Ph D. student ', ' Ph.

"Estimating Trajectory of Recovery in Cardiac Rehabilitation using Mobile Health Technology and Personalized Machine Learning Project Summary/Abstract The objective of our work leverages mobile health technology to develop machine learning models for longitudinal trajectories of recovery like those needed in cardiac rehabilitation. The investigation uses mobile health technology to quantify trajectories of recovery measures, personalizing understanding of exercise capacity and cardiac function. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programs reduce cardiovascular mortality risks and improve patient outcomes in such longitudinal fashion, through increased exercise capacity as measured by peak V02 improvements over the course of care. These programs have recently been extended to include heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) patients. Despite the reduction in mortality and readmissions, participation and adherence in cardiac rehabilitation programs remains a challenge, especially in underserved communities because of limited program availability, the distance and transportation access to a program, its hours of operation, as well as a lack of diversity and gender-dominated programs. Home-based programs using smartphones have shown to increase adherence and achieve similar outcomes. While home-based programs also improved resting heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and levels of physical activity achieved through metabolic equivalent of tasks and peak V02 at the end of the study, users expressed a desire to have individualized education and treatment. Home-based systems still do not achieve real-time interaction, feedback, and monitoring that center-based rehabilitation does through a lack of feedback and necessity of self-reported exertion values. A system is needed that quantify measures of exercise capacity, which can lead to recovery, dynamically throughout the course of treatment. This proposal develops an unobtrusive system, with new mobile health technology sensors, and trains analytic models that allow for personalized quantification of rehabilitation trajectories in HFrEF patients, which can monitor patient adherence and improvement in measures during exercise as well as while at rest. This system investigates the improvement over the course of a 12-week cardiac rehabilitation study and designs trajectories of recovery to understand improvements in peak V02 and exercise capacity in HFrEF patients by also measuring improvements of measurements of heart rate and blood pressure while at rest. This allows for an investigation of additional measures, over time, that may better quantify recovery in HFrEF patients that can be used for center-based rehabilitation or home-based rehabilitation. This can provide a significant enhancement of metrics that define recovery for HFrEF patients with estimations to metrics that are difficult to collect and evaluate. Project Narrative Quantification of trajectories of recovery for patients through wearable mobile health technologies can provide personal understanding of improvements and challenges faced in recovery by patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Such a system will indicate to each patient the improvement in exercise capacity needed to continue preventing any recurrent events, allowing participants to have the understanding and individualized feeling they get from clinic visits and center-based cardiac rehabilitation at home or any other location they wish to participate in recovery activities. The exploration of additional markers of recovery can continue to provide quantification of heart failure conditions useful for clinicians and patients alike.",Estimating Trajectory of Recovery in Cardiac Rehabilitation using Mobile Health Technology and Personalized Machine Learning,10254430,R21EB028486,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Data Collection ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Exercise ', ' Exertion ', ' Feedback ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' mortality ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caring ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Failure ', ' heart function ', ' cardiac function ', ' function of the heart ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Measurement ', ' Metabolic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Ejection Fraction ', ' EFRAC ', ' Visit ', ' Performance ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' Proxy ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' Thorace ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorax ', ' Chest ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Pulse Pressure ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' patient cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' treatment compliance ', ' compliance behavior ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' operation ', ' Cardiac rehabilitation ', ' cardiac rehab ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' rate of change ', ' heart rate monitor ', ' exercise capacity ', ' smart watch ', ' smartwatch ', ' sensor technology ', ' sensing technology ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable biosensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' advanced analytics ', ' underserved community ', ' under served community ', ' Home ', ' transportation access ', ' access to transportation ', ' ']",NIBIB,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R21,2021,177293,TX-17
"Computer-Assisted Histologic Evaluation of Cardiac Allograft Rejection Project Summary Though cardiac transplantation is a lifesaving intervention, cardiac allograft rejection (CAR) remains a relatively common and serious complication that confers an increased risk of acute graft failure and adverse patient outcomes. For three decades, endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) with histological grading, as recommended by the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) has been the broadly applied standard for CAR diagnosis. However, it is widely appreciated that the ISHLT rejection grading standard lacks diagnostic accuracy and has limited ability to discern the mechanism of rejection. These limitations expose patients to risks of both over-treatment and under-treatment, and highlight the unmet need for more accurate and informative approaches to histopathologic analysis of EMB samples. Our team is a leader in computational pathology image analysis with over 200 papers and >30 issued patents in this area. We have already developed and evaluated a computer assisted histopathology grading evaluation (CACHE) scheme which (1) in N=205 patients, had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)=0.95 compared to two cardiac pathologists (mean AUC=0.74) in distinguishing normal from failing hearts and (2) could distinguish low and high ISHLT rejection grades in N=1109 patients with a performance that exceeds that of trained cardiac pathologists. Recognizing the frequent discordance between ISHLT rejection grade and the clinical trajectory of a rejection event, we will further develop and optimize CACHE to identify new “grade agnostic” morphologic biomarkers of clinically serious CAR. Our scientific premise is that morphologic biomarkers prioritized based on their correlation to patients’ clinical trajectories and underlying immunological disease mechanisms will generate an accurate, consistent and informative classifier for diagnosing allograft rejection. In service of this hypothesis, the proposed research will address three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will utilize computational image analysis to discover the morphologic biomarkers of rejection-related injury which are needed to develop a classifier capable of assessing the clinical trajectory of CAR. In Aim 2, we will provide mechanistic annotation of biomarkers identified in Aim 1 through correlation with in-situ immunologic markers using custom multi-parameter immunofluorescence panels. In Aim 3, we employ a multicenter, prospective cohort to validate the diagnostic and mechanistic accuracy of the new rejection classifier developed in Aims 1 and 2. Ultimately, development of a more accurate and mechanistically informative tool for morphologic diagnosis of CAR will improve patient outcomes by reducing over- and under- treatment and inspire applications in other organ transplants. Interestingly, development of a superior histologic diagnostic tool will empower development of alternative, biopsy-free diagnostic approaches that have been handicapped by the necessity of comparison with the flawed ISHLT rejection grade as a reference standard. Project Narrative For heart transplant recipients, allograft rejection remains a relatively common and serious complication associated with adverse patient outcomes. Shortcomings of the current rejection grading standard for heart biopsies leads to both over- and under-treatment, accordingly, this proposal will develop and validate a computer assisted rejection grading classifier that is more accurate, consistent and informative for diagnosing heart allograft rejection. Improved diagnostic accuracy will improve patient outcomes, inspire similar applications in other organ transplants and empower development of additional technologies that have been constrained by the current flawed rejection standard.",Computer-Assisted Histologic Evaluation of Cardiac Allograft Rejection,10246527,R01HL151277,"['Antibodies ', ' Archives ', ' Biopsy ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', '

"An automated system to interpret echocardiography to predict adverse outcomes in patients with right ventricular dysfunction in daily hospital practice Project Summary Right ventricle (RV) dysfunction is a common and complex form of pediatric heart disease. It is also a common contributor to morbidity and mortality for patients with congenital heart diseases (CHD). Due to the complex geometry of the RV and its relative adaptability to changing physiologic conditions, RV dysfunction is poorly understood and difficult to characterize precisely and accurately, thus diagnosis is often delayed. The most common diagnosis tool is echocardiograms. Manual review of echocardiograms is time consuming, however. Furthermore, there might be uncovered echocardiogram patterns associated with RV dysfunctions. In adult studies, machine learning models (MLM) have been successfully implemented to assess RV functions by echocardiograms. We hypothesize that applying novel MLM to pediatric echocardiograms will allow us to improve the accuracy and reliability of assessment, as well as identify novel markers of RV dysfunction. We propose to develop an automated tool to generate a RV health score to identify RV dysfunction and predict the development and time of adverse outcomes including heart failure, heart and/or lung transplantation, and death. The automated tool will constitute an early warning system module, which will be deployed onto a big-data-based risk prediction platform developed by our small business. The study has three specific aims. First, we will extract echocardiograms and structured electronic medical records from the Stanford Children’s Hospital. Cohorts of children with normal or abnormal RV will be constructed. Second, MLM will be developed and validated to 1) predict the presence of RV dysfunction and the probability of adverse outcomes, and 2) predict the rate of progression to adverse outcomes. A deep learning-based workflow will be established to take input of pediatric echocardiogram and clinical data and generate predictions. Third, we will integrate the models developed in Aim #2 into the HBI Spotlight Solutions. The Spotlight Solutions include a healthcare surveillance platform with high-capacity data infrastructure and risk engines to offer AI solutions to care facilities participating the Healthix, the largest public health information exchange network in the US. This will prepare our algorithms for further clinical validation in other cohorts. Project narrative The machine learning models developed in this study will be applicable to any infant, child or adolescent undergoing an echocardiogram, particularly those requiring serial exams to assess changes from disease progression or treatment effect. It can be adopted by pediatric clinicians to assess cardiac function with a high degree of accuracy and confidence, even for those who have little training in echocardiography, thus improving access to healthcare and potentially reducing costs.",An automated system to interpret echocardiography to predict adverse outcomes in patients with right ventricular dysfunction in daily hospital practice,10326000,R41HL160362,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Automation ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Echocardiography ', ' Echocardiogram ', ' Transthoracic Echocardiography ', ' heart sonography ', ' Environment ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Health ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' care facilities ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart Transplantation ', ' Cardiac Transplantation ', ' Heart Grafting ', ' cardiac graft ', ' cardiovascular transplantation ', ' heart transplant ', ' Hospitals ', ' Pediatric Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Infant ', ' Learning ', ' Lung Transplantation ', ' Lung Grafting ', ' lung transplant ', ' Manuals ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' pressure ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Businesses ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' congenital heart disorder ', ' congenital cardiac abnormality ', ' congenital cardiac disease ', ' congenital cardiac disorder ', ' congenital cardiac malformation ', ' congenital heart abnormality ', ' congenital heart anomaly ', ' congenital heart disease ', ' congenital heart malformation ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Right ventricular structure ', ' Right Ventricles ', ' Left ventricular structure ', ' Left Ventricles ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' heart function ', ' cardiac function ', ' function of the heart ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Right Ventricular Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Longterm Follow-up ', ' Long-term Follow-up ', ' long-term followup ', ' longterm followup ', ' Small Business Technology Transfer Research ', ' STTR ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' billing data ', ' treatment effect ', ' Plug-in ', ' novel marker ', ' new marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' electronic structure ', ' population health ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' Geometry ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' Patient risk ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' Pediatric cardiology ', ' individual patient ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' health care availability ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' Precision Health ', ' deep learning ', ' data infrastructure ', ' structured data ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NHLBI,"MPROBE, INC.",R41,2021,346545,CA-18
"Platform for high-throughput biomechanical measurements using metallic islands on boron nitride nanosheets SUMMARY This proposal describes a new platform for high-throughput measurement of mechanical phenomena in cells. The platform is based on a type of strain sensor comprising metallic nanoislands supported by hexagonal boron nitride. Mechanical deformation produces a change in both the electrical resistance and the optical scattering of these sensors. These processes allow the detection of deformations ≤1 ppm (≤0.0001% strain). This unprecedented level of sensitivity permits the measurement of minute forces produced by cells that cannot be measured using existing methods, and the electrical signals can be analyzed rapidly using machine-learning algorithms. While this sensor has a broad range of potential applications in cell biology, we apply it here to a ubiquitous challenge in cardiovascular medicine and drug discovery. In particular, contractile dysfunction in cardiomyocytes is associated with a range of difficult-to-treat cardiomyopathies. In drug discovery, cardiotoxicity (myopathy, arrhythmia, or both) is a leading reason for the failure of drugs during development and aftermarket launch. For some classes of drugs—especially those used in chemotherapy—up to 30% of patients experience heart disease related to their treatment. Indeed, heart failure is the second most common reason for death of cancer patients. There are currently no assays that are both predictive of cardiotoxicity and are of sufficient throughput to implement early in drug development (i.e., when safer drug leads can be selected among analogues). We propose the use of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) bearing various disease-associated mutations as a test case of our nano-enabled biomechanical sensor. In particular, we will construct an array based on a “96-well” plate format combined with high-throughput analysis using a purpose-designed machine learning algorithm in order to measure the forces and kinetics of contractility of the cells. Such a platform would enable large-scale evaluation of disease mechanisms and accelerate therapeutic target discovery by permitting high-throughput, unbiased testing. This application offers the exciting possibility of introducing aspects of the biology of the human heart early in the discovery pipeline. More broadly, the platform we describe offers the potential of answering deep questions about mechanical phenomena in cells—“the mechanome”—which play critical roles in human health.

"Dynamic prediction of heart failure using real-time functional status and EHR data in the ambulatory setting Project Summary/Abstract The candidate and principal investigator (PI) Geoffrey Tison, MD, MPH, is an Assistant Professor in the Divi- sion of Cardiology at the University of California, San Francisco. The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent clinician-investigator with the training necessary to perform technology-leveraged clinical research to both investigate and facilitate cardiovascular disease prevention. Specifically, the training aims of this award will allow the PI to build upon his existing clinical research and data analysis skills to employ machine learning and other technology-based solutions, like mobile health tools, to advance heart failure prevention. The candi- date will complete coursework to develop his skills in machine learning, medical informatics, and clinical trial design and implementation, taking part in the UCSF Medical Informatics Training Program. To achieve these training goals, the candidate has assembled a mentoring team with extensive and complimentary expertise in clinical trials, epidemiology, and technology-enabled research (Dr. Jeff Olgin, the primary mentor, Dr. Mark Pletcher, Dr. Veronique Roger), biomedical/clinical informatics and novel data analysis (Dr. Atul Butte) and heart failure clinical and research expertise (Dr. Liviu Klein, Dr. Veronique Roger, Dr. John Spertus). This pro- ject seeks to take advantage of our current digital medical era to remotely capture individualized up-to-date patient data and predict dynamic risk, addressing the unmet need to improve remote heart failure management and decrease heart failure hospitalization. The project will test and develop tools to predict dynamic heart fail- ure risk based on real-time data measured in a free-living heart failure population—using a novel smartphone- based tool—and from patterns in up-to-date EHR data. The specific aims are: Aim 1–! Examine changes in functional status, measured by serial Self-Administered 6 Minute Walk Test, as a predictor of near-term HF hospitalization. Aim 2–! Develop a “dynamic” heart failure risk model that incorporates four types of up-to-date EHR data as it becomes available—including encounters, medication refills/changes, labs and vital signs. This research is expected to produce two validated methods to estimate dynamic, up-to-date heart failure risk to enable the provision of earlier, more effective outpatient interventions that decrease hospitalization. This con- tribution has the potential to improve remote management for heart failure patients, while shifting the clinical care paradigm to utilize dynamic, longitudinal and free-living data for clinical decision-making. This award will directly enable a future R01-level randomized pragmatic clinical to trial test the hypothesis that delivery of up- to-date risk information to outpatient clinicians can decrease future HF hospitalizations. This award will provide the PI with a unique combination of skills: a strong clinical background, a rigorous clinical research foundation, advanced analytic skills in machine learning and fluency to utilize health-related technologies to derive insights and deliver preventive interventions. Project Narrative Heart failure is the number one cause of hospital readmission in those over 65 years of age and the current standard-of-care of weight self-monitoring is inadequate to predict exacerbation. This project aims to improve the monitoring of heart failure disease progression through the use of real-time, up-to-date data obtained both from a smartphone-based tool and from the electronic health record. The goal is to develop a low-risk, clinically validated method to estimate dynamic heart failure risk to enable the provision of earlier, more effective outpatient interventions that decrease hospitalization.",Dynamic prediction of heart failure using real-time functional status and EHR data in the ambulatory setting,10086491,K23HL135274,"['Ambulatory Care ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Award ', ' California ', ' Cardiology ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Investments ', ' Medical Informatics ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' San Francisco ', ' Self Administration ', ' Self-Administered ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Telemedicine ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Funding ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' behavior change ', ' CVD prevention ', ' cardiac disease prevention ', ' cardiovascular disease prevention ', ' cardiovascular disorder prevention ', ' experience ', ' functional status ', ' professor ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' preempt ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Prevention ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Harvest ', ' K23 Award ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Program ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' intervention for prevention ', ' prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' preventive intervention ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' digital ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinical care ', ' standard of care ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' Theory of Change ', ' Data Science ', ' Big Data to Knowledge ', ' BD2K ', ' Pragmatic clinical trial ', ' big biomedical data ', ' large scale biomedical data sets ', ' large scale biomedical datasets ', ' large-scale biomedical data ', ' smartphone Application ', ' Android App ', ' Android Application ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smartphone App ', ' iOS app ', ' iOS application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iPhone Application ', ' advanced analytics ', ' multiple data sources ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' digital medicine ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2021,203678,CA-12
"Mending a Broken Heart Allocation System with Machine Learning PROJECT ABSTRACT Heart transplantation is a life-saving treatment for end-stage heart failure, a devastating disease which kills over 250,000 Americans each year. Unfortunately, the supply of deceased donor hearts cannot meet demand, and over a third of candidates will die or be delisted without transplant. In the context of such scarcity, allocation must make the best use of scarce deceased donor hearts by ranking candidates from most to least medically urgent. In contrast to other organ transplant systems, there is currently no objective score used to rank heart transplant candidates on the waitlist. Instead, each candidate’s priority for transplantation is based on “Status,” a designation determined by the supportive therapy prescribed by their transplant center. I have previously shown that some heart transplant centers appear to overtreat candidates with intensive therapies at far higher rates than other centers. My preliminary data demonstrates that these practices have consequences for heart allocation effectiveness. High survival benefit centers reserve intense supportive therapy for candidates who have poor prognoses without transplant, saving lives by prioritizing the sickest patients. In contrast, low survival benefit centers list stable candidates and escalate the use of supportive therapies. Based on these data, there is a clear need for a new system to fairly allocate donor hearts. The overall objective of this K08 application is to develop and simulate a novel Heart Allocation Score (HAS) designed to objectively identify the candidates who gain the greatest survival benefit from heart transplantation. Previous attempts to develop such a score using conventional statistical methods have been inaccurate, but cutting-edge machine learning (ML) techniques outperform conventional regression models in many clinical contexts. In addition, a new open-source Heart Simulated Allocation Model (HSAM) is needed to compare policy alternatives because the available program is closed-source, inflexible, outdated, and structurally unable to simulate allocation scores developed with ML. My overall hypothesis is that a HAS developed with ML will lead to policy that optimizes heart allocation. I will test this hypothesis in three Aims. In Aim 1, I will use the complete national transplant registry dataset (N = 109,315 adult candidates) to predict waitlist survival, comparing ML prediction models to the current therapy-based system. In Aim 2, I will use the same registry to predict post-transplant survival for heart recipients, comparing conventional statistical methods to ML. In Aim 3, I will develop a) a new, open-source HSAM which I will use to b) compare current policy to a novel HAS policy constructed from the best prediction models from Aim 1 & 2. My overall career goal is to save lives by designing delivery systems that fairly and efficiently distribute scarce medical resources. To accomplish this, I plan to earn a PhD in Health Services Research focused on ML, simulation modeling, and health policy. Achieving the goals of this proposal will lead to the foundation of a novel heart allocation system that has the potential to save lives and equip me with the skills needed for future R01- level applications in the field of scarce healthcare resource allocation. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Heart transplantation is a potentially life-saving treatment for end-stage heart failure but unfortunately donors are scarce and only a fortunate minority of patients receive hearts. Current heart allocation policy relies on the intensity of treatment to decide who receives a heart, but this system cannot consistently identify the sickest candidates who stand to benefit the most from heart transplantation. This proposal aims to improve heart allocation by 1) developing a data-driven, objective heart allocation score with cutting-edge machine learning techniques, and 2) building novel, more flexible simulation software.",Mending a Broken Heart Allocation System with Machine Learning,10088470,K08HL150291,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Charge ', ' Communities ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health delivery systems ', ' health services delivery ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Health Resources ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' services research ', ' Heart ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart Transplantation ', ' Cardiac Transplantation ', ' Heart Grafting ', ' cardiac graft ', ' cardiovascular transplantation ', ' heart transplant ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Organ Transplantation ', ' Grafting Procedure ', ' Organ Transplants ', ' organ allograft ', ' organ graft ', ' organ xenograft ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Publishing ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Savings ', ' Testing ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Policy Analysis ', ' Policy Analyses ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Policies ', ' tool ', ' Supportive Therapy ', ' Supportive care ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Update ', ' organ procurement transplantation network ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' open source ', ' transplant registry ', ' high risk ', ' clinical practice ', ' organ allocation ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' simulation software ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' transplant centers ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' post-transplant ', ' post-transplantation ', ' posttransplant ', ' posttransplantation ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K08,2021,157896,IL-01
"Skin-like, stretchable, and wearable sensors for monitoring QT interval and hemodynamic variables in Atrial Fibrillation Project Summary  Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia in adults, carries a lifetime risk of 25-33%, and cost the US healthcare system > 6 Billion dollars a year. Morbidities from AF include congestive heart failure, dementia, symptoms due to decreased cardiac output, and most importantly an elevated thrombotic stroke risk due to blood stasis. Recent advances in wearable technology have increased the capacity and accuracy of AF diagnosis through monitoring heart rate variability in an ambulatory setting. However, there remains no available ambulatory technologies that permit continuous assessment of the hemodynamic effects of AF nor measurements of cardiac repolarization that determine the proarrhythmic effects of antiarrhythmic drugs. Some treatment aspects of AF have remained controversial due to limited efficacy of rhythm control interventions including cardiac ablation and pharmacologic therapy, both of which have significant risks. Pharmacologic interventions using Class III antiarrhythmics are especially risky due to the proarrhythmic effects on ventricular repolarization which can lead to life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. As a result of these issues, careful assessment of ventricular repolarization, as represented by the QT interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG), is required during drug initiation. This requires lengthy and costly inpatient monitoring during drug loading and difficulties in maintaining the narrow therapeutic window after discharge. Having a reliable method to quantify measures of hemodynamic instability that leads to some AF- related symptoms, as well as continuously monitoring the QT interval and other clinically important parameters in an ambulatory setting would allow clinicians to tailor their care to the individual. This proposal aims to refine a flexible, non-obtrusive wearable system to continuously monitor these key clinical parameters, help in predicting heart rhythm complications and regulate medication intervention for both rhythm control and rate control of AF. A sensor suite consisting of a small, wireless and flexible chest-worn patch that measures both ECG and accelerometer based seismocardiography (SCG) and a wirelessly time synchronized flexible limb unit capable of monitoring photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals will be used. Aim 1 will quantitatively define the optimal location for QT interval monitoring on the surface of the chest. Aim 2 will combine the ECG, SCG, and PPG data streams and extract both unique and time-relational parameters from the signal streams known to be related to cardiac function and hemodynamics, using machine learning to obtain predictions of hemodynamic instability from these complex relationships. Aim 3 will address the use and compliance of this wearable system in a clinical setting against the standard of care during Class III antiarrhythmic drug loading and pharmacologic cardioversion. The results from this study will provide the first ambulatory measures of AF symptoms and responses to treatment, informing future studies and clinical care teams of the dominant bioelectrical and biomechanical parameters that are the most important in the care of the growing, aging population with AF. Project Narrative  Atrial Fibrillation is a highly prevalent disease in advanced age, a frequent comorbidity to many common diseases, and contributes to increased hospitalization risk and healthcare costs. This project aims to develop a mobile telemonitoring platform to simultaneously monitor symptoms of atrial fibrillation, such as hemodynamic instability and rhythm disturbances, as well as allow the patient and clinician to monitor, predict, and intervene to significant side effects of common pharmacologic treatment of the disease.","Skin-like, stretchable, and wearable sensors for monitoring QT

"Improving cardiovascular image-based phenotyping using emerging methods in artificial intelligence Summary / Abstract Objective — The goal of this proposal is to develop and optimize novel deep learning (DL) assisted approaches to improve diagnosis and clinical decision-making for congenital heart disease (CHD). This will be achieved by using DL, machine learning (ML), and related methods to extract diagnosis, biometric characterizations, and other information from fetal ultrasound imaging. Notably, this work includes a clinical translational evaluation of these methods in a population-wide imaging collection spanning two decades, tens of thousands of patients, and several clinical centers. Background — Despite clear and numerous benefits to prenatal detection of CHD and an ability for fetal ultrasound to detect over 90% of CHD lesions in theory, in practice the fetal CHD detection rate is closer to 50%. Prior literature suggests a key cause of this startling diagnosis gap is suboptimal acquisition and interpretation of fetal heart images. DL is a novel data science technique that is proving excellent at pattern recognition in images. DL models are a function of the design and tuning of a neural network architecture, and the curation and processing of the image data used to train the network. Preliminary Studies — We have assembled a multidisciplinary team of experts in echocardiography and CHD (Drs. Grady, Levine, and Arnaout), DL and data science (Drs. Keiser, Butte and Arnaout), and statistics and clinical research (Drs. Arnaout and Grady) and secured access to tens of thousands of multicenter (UCSF and six other centers), multimodal fetal imaging studies. We have created a scalable image processing pipeline to transform clinical studies into image data ready for computing. We have designed and trained DL models to find key cardiac views in fetal ultrasound, calculate standard and advanced fetal cardiac biometrics from those views, and distinguish between normal hearts and certain CHD lesions. Hypothesis — While DL is powerful, much work is still needed to adapt it for clinical imaging and to translate it toward clinically relevant performance in patient populations. We hypothesize that an integrated ensemble DL/ML approach can lead to vast improvements in fetal CHD diagnosis. Aims — To this end, the main Aims of this proposal are (1) to develop and optimize neural network architectures and efficient data inputs to relieve key performance bottlenecks for DL in fetal CHD; and (2) to deploy DL models population-wide to evaluate their ability to improve diagnosis, biometric characterization, and precision phenotyping over the current standard of care. Our methods include DL/ML algorithms and retrospective imaging analysis. Environment and Impact — This work will be supported in an outstanding environment for research at the crossroads of data science, cardiovascular and fetal imaging, and translational informatics. The work proposed will provide valuable tools and insight into designing and evaluating both the data and the algorithms for DL on imaging for clinically relevant goals, and will lay important groundwork for DL-assisted phenotyping for both clinical use and precision medicine research.

"A Multi-Dimensional Linked Registry to Identify Biological, Clinical, Health System, and Socioeconomic Risk Factors for COVID-19-Related Cardiovascular Events PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There is mounting concern that patients hospitalized with COVID-19 experience unexpectedly high rates of cardiac and vascular events. Identifying which patients are at highest risk for COVID-19-related cardiovascular events and delineating how these events affect short- and long-term outcomes may help support individualized patient care, illuminate underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms, and accelerate the development of effective therapies. However, little is known about how multi-dimensional risk factors, including prior medical conditions, socioeconomic indicators, and circulating levels of biomarkers affect patient outcomes. Building on our team's expertise in data linkage, prediction modeling, and biomarker discovery, we will create a unique and powerful linked data resource to characterize the biological, clinical, health system, and socioeconomic risk factors for the development of cardiovascular sequelae of COVID-19 and examine their impact on health outcomes. To create this data resource, we have partnered with the American Heart Association, whose COVID-19 Cardiovascular Disease Registry is actively capturing high-quality, standardized information on all adults hospitalized with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at >100 U.S. sites spanning 30 states. We will link this registry to comprehensive health care claims, a national socioeconomic deprivation index, and detailed health care system information. In Aim 1, we will apply traditional and machine learning approaches to the linked multicenter registry in order to identify the clinical, health system, and socioeconomic factors that predict in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) among COVID-19 patients. In Aim 2, we will characterize long-term MACE (i.e., at 1 and 2 years after discharge from the index COVID-19 hospitalization) among older adults in a large multicenter registry linked with longitudinal Medicare claims, and identify the clinical, health system, and socioeconomic factors that predict their occurrence. Based on this work, we will create clinically implementable risk scores which will estimate, at the time of admission for and discharge from an index COVID-19 hospitalization, a patient's risk of developing a major cardiovascular event. In Aim 3, we evaluate the proteomic profiles of a subset of patients in the linked registry with biobanked serial blood samples, and identify biochemical markers that predict the occurrence of MACE, both during index hospitalization for COVID-19 and after discharge. This research will advance our collective understanding of the biological, clinical, and socioeconomic predictors of COVID-19-related cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. By identifying patients at greatest at risk of cardiovascular events, our work will help frontline clinicians better individualize clinical management strategies and health systems improve care delivery during future waves of the pandemic. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular events (heart damage, stroke, blood clots) appear to be both common and dangerous in patients who are hospitalized with COVID-19. A better understanding of which patients are at highest risk for these events is a key step to developing better approaches for prevention and treatment. We will combine multiple sources of information, including a large national COVID-19 registry from the American Heart Association, health care data from Medicare, and blood protein levels from patients treated at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, to identify the factors that are associated with a higher risk of short- and long-term cardiovascular events among patients hospitalized with

"Refining repeat screening for coronary artery disease in kidney transplant candidates 7. Project Summary This K23 proposal will provide Xingxing S. Cheng, MD, MS with the protected time, mentorship, training, and research experience to become an independent clinical investigator. Dr. Cheng is a board-certified nephrologist and accredited transplant nephrologist, with a long-term vision of improving the effectiveness of health care for kidney transplant patients. She seeks to combine patient-oriented research and decision science to find innovative solutions to clinical problems. Skills she will acquire in this grant, under the guidance of a strong mentorship team, include 1) integration of patient-oriented research and decision analytic models; 2) assessing the heterogeneity of response in different patient subgroups; and 3) advanced modelling skills. This grant proposes to refine the process of screening of coronary artery disease in patients with chronic kidney disease on the wait-list awaiting kidney transplantation. Currently, patients undergo repeat cardiac screening tests at frequent intervals, few of which result in interventions. These tests impose a high treatment burden on patients and potentially delay time to transplant, while bringing unclear benefit to the patient. This grant proposes to refine the cardiac screening strategy and personalize it for specific patient subgroups (e.g. elderly patients with diabetes mellitus). It will examine strategies that vary the frequency of cardiac testing and risk stratification for cardiac testing based on a simple, inexpensive, and non-invasive test that can be performed in routine clinical settings, a 6-minute walk test (6MWT). This project will achieve this broad aim by three specific aims: 1) to characterize the 6MWT in identifying low-risk patients who do not additional cardiac testing; 2) to model strategies varying the frequency of cardiac testing and use of 6MWT; 3) to design strategies personalized for specific patient subgroups and model them in the entire kidney transplant candidate population of the United States (US). The first two aims will arise from a well-characterized cohort of patients at Dr. Cheng’s institution. Machine-learning systems will be used to identify which patient subgroups are best served by which strategies (i.e. the heterogeneity of response). The third aim will leverage the US Renal Data System, which Dr. Cheng’s mentors and institution has a track record of leveraging for innovative research. The proposed work has high potential to make a significant clinical impact. Its completion will enable the identification and characterization of rational strategies for pre-transplant screening of coronary artery disease that may be incorporated into clinical practice or pave the way for a future multi-center comparative effectiveness trial. The proposed work is realistic and feasible within the award period, and will allow Dr. Cheng to build research skills, advance and disseminate scientific knowledge, create additional collaborative networks, and compete for R01 or equivalent funding. In summary, the K23 award will provide the support to enable Dr. Cheng to become a successful independent clinical investigator. 8. Project Narrative Currently, patients on the kidney transplant waitlist undergo repeat cardiac screening tests at frequent intervals, but relatively few interventions result. This project proposes to refine the cardiac screening strategy and personalize it for specific patient subgroups (e.g. elderly patients without diabetes mellitus), by examining strategies that reduce the frequency of cardiac testing and use performance-based risk stratification to reduce the number of patients who need cardiac testing.

"Mechanisms of Abnormal Diaphragm and Cardiac Development Project Summary  Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a life-threatening birth defect that accounts for 8% of all major congenital anomalies. In cases where CDH co-occurs with cardiovascular malformations (CVMs), mortality rates increase from 30 to 60%, and long-term morbidity is common. Our goal is to identify genes that cause CDH and CDH/CVM, and to discover the mechanism by which they control diaphragm and heart development.  Correctly identifying genes that contribute to specific phenotypes from the large list of candidate genes data generated in research and clinical studies is a major obstacle to progress in this and other research fields. In Specific Aim #1, we will address this challenge by generating ranked CDH and CDH/CVM pathogenicity scores for all RefSeq genes using a machine-learning algorithm that integrates data from large-scale genomic knowledge sources. We will use these scores to identify novel CDH and CDH/CVM genes from cytogenetically defined critical regions and form large next-generation sequencing databases as part of our multifaceted approach to novel gene discovery. We will also accelerate the pace at which human disease genes are discovered by making these scores and our machine-learning algorithm freely available.  8p23.1 microdeletions that encompass GATA4 and SOX7 are among the most frequently identified causes of CDH/CVM. In RNA-seq studies, we identified several CDH-associated genes that are dysregulated in the E15.5 diaphragms of Gata4flox/flox;Prx1-Cre embryos. These embryos are an ideal model of the sac hernias that comprise 20% of human CDH cases. In Specific Aim #2, we will combine data from RNA-seq and BioChIP-seq analyses with the priority scores generated in Aim #1 to identify primary GATA4 target genes whose dysregulation contribute to the development of sac CDH. We will then determine if alterations in the expression of these target genes can cause CDH, or can modify the CDH phenotypes of GATA4-deficient mice.  We have shown that SOX7 deficiency causes septal defects by decreasing endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in the developing heart. In RNA-seq and in situ hybridization studies we have shown that the expression of Wnt4—a key regulator of EMT in the endocardium—is severely decreased in E9.5 Sox7-/- hearts. In Specific Aim #3 we will determine if Wnt4 is a primary target of SOX7, and whether modulation of WNT4 or its downstream effectors can rescue SOX7-related cardiac phenotypes.  Several lines of evidence suggset that WNT4 is a novel CDH/CVM gene in humans. To confirm this association, and learn more about the role of WNT4 in diaphragm and heart development, we will determine if WNT4 deficiency causes CDH/CVM in mice, if Sox7 and Wnt4 interact genetically in the development of CDH/CVM and if SOX7 regulates Wnt4 transcripition in the developing diaphragm.  Through these studies we will identify novel CDH and CDH/CVM genes and pathways. The bioinformatic tools we develop in this grant will enhance gene discovery efforts across multiple research fields. Project Narrative Diaphragmatic hernias and cardiovascular malformations are serious birth defects. In this study, we will use bioinformatics and mouse models to identify genes that cause these birth defects and to learn how they work. These experiments will help us to understand how the diaphragm and heart form prior to birth and may ultimately lead to new ways of treating or preventing these birth defects.",Mechanisms of Abnormal Diaphragm and Cardiac Development,10201699,R01HD098458,"['Congenital Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Malformation ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Association Learning ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cytogenetics ', ' Respiratory Diaphragm ', ' Diaphragm ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Encyclopedias ', ' Endocardium ', ' Endothelium ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Heart ', ' Hernia ', ' Diaphragmatic Hernia ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Newborns ', ' newborn child ', ' newborn children ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Luciferases ', ' Luciferase Immunologic ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Phenotype ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Syndrome ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Work ', ' In Situ Hybridization ', ' in situ Hybridization Genetics ', ' in situ Hybridization Staining Method ', ' dosage ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Congenital diaphragmatic hernia ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' sequence database ', ' sequencing database ', ' molecular sequence database ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' biochip ', ' genome database ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' Micro RNA ', ' miRNA ', ' miRNAs ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' heart development ', ' heart formation ', ' cardiogenesis ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' WNT4 ', ' Wingless-Type MMTV Integration Site Family, Member 4 ', ' WNT4 gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Mesenchymal ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' intervention for prevention ', ' prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' preventive intervention ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' genomic region ', ' Ontology ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' epigenomics ', ' microdeletion ', ' Chromosomal microdeletion ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' malformation ', ' mouse genome ', ' human disease ', ' web based interface ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' gene discovery ', ' discover genes ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' NGS Method ', ' NGS system ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' congenital anomaly ', ' Cardiac development ', ' GATA4 gene ', ' GATA binding protein 4 ', ' GATA4 ', ' GATA4 transcription factor ', ' SOX7 gene ', ' SOX7 ', ' SRY-Box 7 ', ' septal defect ', ' septum defect ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' bioinformatics tool ', ' bio-informatics tool ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' ']",NICHD,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,448377,TX-09

We demonstrated that spatial (/x) and temporal (/t) variations in shear stress modulates Notch-EphrinB2-Neureguilin-1 signaling in the endocardium to activate erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase (ErbB2) that promotes proliferation of trabeculation. By integrating LSFM, computation, and transgenic models, we further established that trabeculation dissipates intracardiac shear stress-generated kinetic energy; thus, mitigating ventricular remodeling. However, it remains unclear what would be the consequences of reduced myocardial contractility or altered intracardiac flow dynamics on valve morphogenesis. Thus, we seek to integrate light-sheet (Bessel-Gaussian beam arrays) with a new 2) light-field (microlens array). The former provides non-diffracting illumination, and the latter provides volumetric detection as a paradigm shift to image both myocardial contractility and intracardiac flow dynamics in the outflow tract (OFT). Our preliminary study reveals that shear-mediated Notch1b expression in the endocardium of OFT regulates endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT); however, the mechanotransduction causation whereby myocardial contractility and intracardiac shear stress reciprocally interact to form bicuspid valves and subsequent remodeling to multi-cuspid valves remains elusive. Thus, our hypothesis is that integration of the new light-field system with imaging computation enhances spatiotemporal resolution needed to decouple myocardial contraction from intracardiac flow dynamics that modulates Notch1b-EndoMT to mediate valve morphogenesis in the OFT. In Aim 1, we plan to integrate light-sheet with the new light-field system for 4-D volumetric imaging of valve formation in the OFT. Our goal is to capture myocardial contractility and intracardiac shear stress at one snapshot. In Aim 2, we will demonstrate the interaction between intracardiac shear stress and myocardial contractility underlying valve morphogenesis. Our goal is to decouple hemodynamic shear from contractile forces that mediate Notch1b-mediated EndoMT. In Aim 3, we will determine the relative role of shear stress and contractility underlying Notch1b-mediated EndoMT. Our goal is to elucidate the relative role of contractility and intracardiac stress to transmit Notch1b- EndoMT signaling underlying bicuspid-valve formation. Overall, our team aims to establish the micro- environment in which intracardiac flow dynamics and myocardial contractility interact to modulate OFT valve formation, with clinical significance to aortic valvular disease. Project Narrative Cardiac outflow tract (OFT) defects, including aortic valves and the greater arteries, are estimated to cause approximately 30% of these congenital heart diseases, and they are treated with surgical correction and/or replacement. It remains unclear what would be the consequences of reduced cardiac contractility or altered intracardiac flow dynamics on valve morphogenesis, including aortic stenosis, bicuspid or tricuspid aortic valves. To understand the mechanotransduction causation downstream of blood flow and shear stress sensing, we have assembled a multi-disciplinary team to integrate advanced laser optics, imaging computation, and genetic models to decouple intracardiac flow dynamics from myocardial contractility that modulates Notch1b-mediated endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) with translational implication to aortic valve disease.",Shear stress and light-field to elucidate the initiation of cardiac outflow tract,10146767,R01HL129727,"['aortic valve ', ' Aortic Valve Stenosis ', ' Aortic Stenosis ', ' Arteries ', ' Bicuspid ', ' Bicuspid Tooth ', ' Premolar ', ' Premolar Tooth ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Cuspid ', ' Canine Tooth ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Endocardium ', ' Endothelium ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Heart ', ' Congenital Heart Defects ', ' Congenital Cardiac Defects ', ' congenital cardiac anomalies ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Kinetics ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Lighting ', ' Illumination ', ' Microscopy ', ' Fluorescence Microscopy ', ' Fluorescence Light Microscopy ', ' Mitral Valve ', ' Bicuspid Valve ', ' Genetic Models ', ' Morphogenesis ', ' morphogenetic process ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Myocardial Contraction ', ' heart contraction ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Genetic Recombination ', ' DNA Recombination ', ' Recombination ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' erbB-2 Receptor ', ' ErbB2 receptor ', ' Oncogene Protein HER-2 ', ' Proto-Oncogene Protein HER-2 ', ' erbB-2 Proto-Oncogene Protein ', ' neu Receptor ', ' notch protein ', ' notch ', ' notch receptors ', ' Mediating ', ' congenital heart disorder ', ' congenital cardiac abnormality ', ' congenital cardiac disease ', ' congenital cardiac disorder ', ' congenital cardiac malformation ', ' congenital heart abnormality ', ' congenital heart anomaly ', ' congenital heart disease ', ' congenital heart malformation ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases ', ' PTK Receptors ', ' Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Gene ', ' Transmembrane Receptor Protein Tyrosine Kinase ', ' Tyrosine Kinase Linked Receptors ', ' Tyrosine Kinase Receptors ', ' Blood flow ', ' ERBB2 gene ', ' ERBB2 ', ' HER -2 ', ' HER-2 ', ' HER2 ', ' HER2 Genes ', ' HER2/neu ', ' NEU Oncogene ', ' NEU protein ', ' Oncogene ErbB2 ', ' TKR1 ', ' c-erbB-2 ', ' c-erbB-2 Genes ', ' c-erbB-2 Proto-Oncogenes ', ' erbB-2 Genes ', ' herstatin ', ' neu Genes ', ' Funding ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Reporter ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' System ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' transgenic ', ' Transgenic Organisms ', ' Ventricle Remodeling ', ' Ventricular Cardiac Remodeling ', ' Ventricular Myocardial Remodeling ', ' myocardial remodeling ', ' Ventricular Remodeling ', ' Acetylcholine Receptor Inducing Activity ', ' Breast Cancer Cell Differentiation Factor P45 ', ' NDF Protein ', ' NRG1 Gene Product ', ' NRG1 Protein ', ' Sensory And Motor Neuron-Derived Factor ', ' Neuregulin 1 ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' response ', ' shear stress ', ' Aortic valvular disorders ', ' aortic valve defect ', ' aortic valve disease ', ' aortic valvular disease ', ' aortic valve disorder ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Defect ', ' Detection ', ' Mesenchymal ', ' Resolution ', ' Transgenic Model ', ' transgenic trait ', ' Myocardial ', ' Ventricular ', ' Cardiac ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' optical imaging ', ' optic imaging ', ' Coupled ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' transcriptomics ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' 4D Imaging ', ' 4-D imaging ', ' four-dimensional imaging ', ' Gaussian model ', ' Gaussian statistics ', ' Gaussianity ', ' Gaussianity model ', ' mechanotransduction ', ' mechanosensing ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' automated segmentation ', ' auto-segmentation ', ' automatic segmentation ', ' autosegmentation ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,459651,CA-33
"Impact of Disparities Affecting Survival among Advanced Heart Failure Patients and Transplant Recipients DESCRIPTION: The current heart transplant allocation system and the newly recommended one prioritizes patients based on waitlist survival and does not take into account risk of death after transplant or likelihood of transplantation. Furthermore, it defines medical urgency for transplantation mainly by use of devices and not by objective evidence of medical illness. Unfortunately, many heart failure patients die on the waitlist, including a disproportionate number of women, Hispanics, and patients with certain heart diseases like restrictive cardiomyopathy. After transplantation there are also survival disparities. The long-term goal of this project is to optimize timing for advanced heart failure therapy in order to improve survival and minimize organ wastage. The objective of this research application is to identify risk factors for disparities in survival among heart transplant candidates and post-transplantation and to create tools that will improve outcome in therapy while minimizing organ wastage. The central hypothesis is that a better heart transplant allocation system requires knowledge of how population differences affect patient selection, waitlist mortality, and post-transplant mortality. The rationale for the proposed research is that there are known disparities (sex, race, and type of heart disease) in survival among advanced heart failure patients (pre- and post-transplantation) and creation of risk prediction models have successfully reduced waitlist mortality for lung, liver, and kidney transplantation. The specific aims of this research proposal are: 1) to identify risk factors for disparities in survival among heart transplant candidates and post-transplantation using the national transplant database 2) to develop a method to dynamically update risk of waitlist mortality across time using data from multiple transplant centers that includes potential prognistic risk factors not available in our national transplant database and 3) to create a mathematical model that simultaneous estimates waitlist and post-transplant mortality to optimize timing of transplantation. The approach is innovative because it utilizes new mathematical approaches and seeks to shift current heart failure research and clinical practice paradigms by taking into account population differences rather than basing decisions solely on ejection fraction, presence of coronary artery disease, and stages of disease. The proposed research is significant, because few studies have explored population differences in advanced heart failure to determine the factors associated with mortality on the waitlist and poor outcome post-transplantation. This proposal will evaluate the complex interplay of population differences (i.e sex, race, type of heart disease, laboratory measures of organ dysfunction, and influences of co-morbidities) as they relate to mortality on the waitlist, timing of transplantation, and mortality after transplantation. If the aims of our proposal are achieved, our research has the potential to empower clinicians and researchers to provide the right therapies for the right patient at the right time. There are disparities in survival among patients on the waiting list for a heart transplant, and post-transplantation. These differences are not recognized by the current and newly recommended heart transplant allocation system.

"Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking PROJECT SUMMARY  Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures tissue parameters such as T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion to detect subtle differences in tissue states (such as microstructure, diffuse fibrosis, edema, hemorrhage, and iron content) from neurological, oncological, and cardiovascular diseases. Because each parameter offers complementary tissue information, multiparameter mapping is very promising for risk assessment, early detection, accurate staging, and treatment monitoring of disease. However, quantitative MRI is typically very time consuming and difficult to perform. Each parameter is typically measured from its own series of images, so measuring multiple parameters leads to long, inefficient scanning sessions. Furthermore, cardiac and breathing motion creates misalignment between images, causing additional problems.  The standard approach to motion is to either remove it (e.g., ask the patient to hold their breath) or to synchronize image acquisition with it (e.g., using electrocardiography (ECG) to monitor cardiac motion). This approach makes scan times even longer, limits imaging to patients who can repeatedly perform long breath holds (which is difficult for aging or weak patients) and who have predictable cardiac motion (which is not true of patients with cardiac arrhythmias). Furthermore, these methods are often unreliable and difficult to perform.  This project is to develop and validate a new technology, MR Multitasking, to perform multiple simultaneous measurements in a single, push-button scan that is both comfortable for patients and simple for technologists to perform. MR Multitasking redesigns quantitative MRI around the concept of images as functions of many time dimensions, each corresponding to a different dynamic process (e.g., motion, T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion), and then uses mathematical models called low-rank tensors to perform fast, multidimensional imaging. This allows continuous acquisition of imaging data even while the subject is moving, providing motion-resolved parameter maps without breath holding or motion synchronization. We will scan healthy subjects, liver patients, prostate cancer patients, and cardiovascular patients to develop and validate this technology and use artificial intelligence to quickly reconstruct images from the collected data. The resulting tool will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to answer a wide range of biomedical questions. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project is to develop and validate a one-stop, push-button solution for comprehensive, motion- resolved quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This will be accomplished by cultivating a new technology, MR Multitasking, which can measure multiple tissue biomarkers in a single scan, even in moving organs. The resulting technology will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to diagnose, monitor, and study a wide range of diseases.","Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking",10084899,R01EB028146,"['Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Arrhythmia ', ' Cardiac Arrhythmia ', ' Heart Arrhythmias ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Breathing ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' inspiration ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Edema ', ' Dropsy ', ' Hydrops ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' ECG ', ' EKG ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' Joints ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lipids ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Respiration ', ' respiratory mechanism ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Measures ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Organ ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Series ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Blood flow ', ' Recovery ', ' Measurement ', ' Fe element ', ' Iron ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Dimensions ', ' Scanning ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Organ System ', ' body system ', ' respiratory ', ' magnetic ', ' Magnetism ', ' magnetic field ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' cardiac motion ', ' heart motion ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Collection ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' reconstruction ', ' time use ', ' prospective ', ' Consumption ', ' multitask ', ' multi-task ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' magnetohydrodynamic ', ' tissue biomarkers ', ' Tissue imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NIBIB,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,616003,CA-28
"Elucidating hereditary transthyretin-mediated heart failure risk using machine learning, polygenic risk and recall by genotype approaches in African ancestry individuals PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Mutations in the Transthyretin (TTR) gene can lead to deposition of abnormal amyloid fibrils in the myocardium, resulting in hereditary transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (hATTR-CM) and leading to heart failure. Targeted therapies for hATTR-CM have recently been developed and have shown to improve mortality and hospitalization.  Recently, we led a study (Journal of American Medical Association, Dec 2019) that showed that the TTR V122I mutation, commonly observed in racial/ethnic minorities (4% in African Americans (AAs) and 1% in Hispanic Americans (HAs)), confers two-fold increased risk of heart failure. Despite this strong effect, only 11% of V122I carriers with heart failure were appropriately diagnosed with hATTR-CM, suggesting marked underdiagnosis and mis-diagnosis of the disease. We further showed subclinical evidence of echocardiographic derangements in young, asymptomatic V122I carriers, suggesting early signs can occur well before onset of disease.  We propose to extend our prior work by addressing knowledge gaps which are necessary for targeted therapies to attain their full potential. These include: understanding the incomplete penetrance of V122I; identifying V122I carriers in large health care systems where genotyping is not common; and understanding subclinical disease burden. In Aim 1, we will examine the interplay between a polygenic risk score, which are comprised of millions of single nucleotide variants with small effects, and V122I, a monogenic mutation with a single strong effect, analyzed in conjunction with clinical risk factors on heart failure in in 6,609 AAs and 9,006 HAs in the BioMe biobank and 5,833 AAs in the Penn Medicine Biobank (PMBB). In Aim 2, we will apply machine learning tools to multi-modal electronic health record (EHR) data to identify V122I carriers in ~8 million patients from an electronic health record (EHR) data repository at Mount Sinai. In Aim 3, we will evaluate subclinical effects of amyloid deposition on cardiac structural/functional traits in young, asymptomatic V122I carriers by recalling V122I carriers for imaging evaluation including research-grade echocardiograms, cardiac magnetic resonance and technetium nuclear scanning.  The proposal is innovative because we are utilizing two large diverse ancestry EHR-linked biobanks from academic health systems (BioMe at Mount Sinai, and PMBB at University of Pennsylvania), along with adopting cutting-edge methods including multi-ethnic polygenic risk scores, and machine learning approaches on multi-modal EHR data. We further propose patient recall based on genotypes and perform deep phenotyping using comprehensive heart imaging scans.  This proposal has the potential to realize the potential of precision medicine for heart failure in racial/ethnic minorities by informing clinical care, population management, risk stratification and clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Transthyretin V122I, is a highly penetrant mutation for hereditary transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (hATTR-CM) that is common in African Americans and Hispanic Americans. Recent therapies have been approved to treat hATTR-CM, which have led to decreased mortality; thus, understanding who will develop hATTR-CM, accurate identification of V122I carriers and understanding hidden disease burden is important. In this proposal, we examine the population health impact of V122I using polygenic risk scores, machine learning approaches on electronic health records, and patient recall by genotype, which can lead to new population health strategies for heart failure in racial and ethnic minorities.","Elucidating hereditary transthyretin-mediated heart failure risk using machine learning, polygenic risk and recall by genotype approaches in African ancestry individuals",10101075,R01HL155915,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' American Medical Association ', ' Amyloid ', ' Amyloid Substance ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Amyloid deposition ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Echocardiography ', ' Echocardiogram ', ' Transthoracic Echocardiography ', ' heart sonography ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Minority People ', ' Minority Population ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Myocardium ', ' cardiac muscle ', ' heart muscle ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Phenotype ', ' Prealbumin ', ' Proalbumin ', ' Transthyretin ', ' Diphosphates ', ' Pyrophosphates ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Technetium ', ' Tc element ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' African American ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' Mediating ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Germ-Line Mutation ', ' Germline Mutation ', ' Hereditary Mutation ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Onset of illness ', ' disease onset ', ' disorder onset ', ' Tc 99m ', ' Technetium 99m ', ' Genetic ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' tool ', ' Supportive Therapy ', ' Supportive care ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Afro-Caribbean ', ' black Caribbean ', ' black carib ', ' African Caribbean ', ' Adopted ', ' Hereditary ', ' Inherited ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Nuclear ', ' Penetrance ', ' cardiac imaging ', ' cardiac scanning ', ' heart scanning ', ' heart imaging ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' single nucleotide variant ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Myocardial Diseases ', ' Myocardial Disorder ', ' Myocardiopathies ', ' myocardium disease ', ' myocardium disorder ', ' Cardiomyopathies ', ' Magnetic Resonance ', ' Documentation ', ' Recontacts ', ' Address ', ' Amyloid Fibrils ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Sum ', ' Myocardial ', ' Cardiac ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' ethnoracial ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' clinical care ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' population health ', ' clinical risk ', ' screening ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' underserved minority ', ' under served minority ', ' racial minority ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' multimodal data ', ' multi-modal data ', ' multi-modal datasets ', ' multimodal datasets ', ' polygenic risk score ', ' data repository ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' multi-ethnic ', ' multiethnic ', ' ']",NHLBI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,770230,NY-13
"Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: Understanding the Heterogeneity of Disease Expression and Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a primary disorder of the myocardium that is characterized by unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), myocyte disarray, and fibrosis. It is the most prevalent genetic heart disorder, affecting ~1 in 500 people. HCM has been the focus of intense clinical and basic science study for decades. These efforts have provided remarkable insights into the molecular basis and clinical course of disease-- defining sarcomere mutations as the most common genetic etiology and characterizing the phenotypic spectrum. Additionally, prior studies have underscored the great heterogeneity of HCM. Although many patients have serious outcomes, including arrhythmias, advanced heart failure, and sudden cardiac death, many others experience mild disease with low symptom burden and normal longevity. Moreover, there is striking diversity in cardiac morphology and function, even amongst patients with identical underlying sarcomere mutations. The factors that drive such marked heterogeneity are poorly understood, highlighting the critical need to better characterize determinants of disease expression and clinical outcomes.  This proposal seeks to identify genotypic and phenotypic features that account for the highly diverse manifestations of HCM. These goals will be addressed by leveraging the recently established Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (SHaRe), containing data on over 9000 HCM patients, and applying state-of- the-art genetic, imaging, and statistical analyses. Our aims are: (1) To identify common genetic variation that impacts disease expression in HCM patients both with and without a driving sarcomere mutation (sarcomeric and non-sarcomeric HCM). These analyses will interrogate background genetic variation to examine how an individual’s genetic make-up influences their susceptibility or resistance to disease. We will also develop polygenic risk scores to assess the cumulative effect of common genetic variants on disease expression. (2) To characterize phenotypic factors that influence disease expression by utilizing machine-learning techniques to identify novel, quantitative high-dimensional imaging features from routinely-performed cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) studies. We will then incorporate these features into rigorous prediction models to improve clinical risk stratification. This approach will allow us to look more deeply into the structure and function of the heart by using the full array of digital data available from CMR imaging, thereby drawing new correlations between phenotype, disease manifestations, and clinical outcomes. Successful completion of these aims will advance our understanding of why disease experience can be so different from patient to patient, provide new insights into mechanism and therapeutic targets, and identify novel biomarkers of disease severity. These results will impact clinical management of patients with HCM by improving the precision and accuracy of diagnosis and risk stratification. Finally, insights gained will likely inform more common forms of heart disease, such as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, with similarly highly heterogeneous manifestations. NARRATIVE Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is heart muscle disease that can cause disabling symptoms, dangerous heart rhythm disturbances, and premature death. Mutations in the genes that encode the sarcomere, the molecular motor of the heart, are the most frequent cause of HCM, however, there is tremendous variation in disease experience from one patient to the next.

"HeartShare DeCODE-HF: Data translation center to Combine Omics, Deep phenotyping, and Electronic health records for Heart Failure subtypes and treatment targets PROJECT SUMMARY  The Overarching Aim of the Northwestern HeartShare DeCODE-HF: Data translation center to Combine Omics, Deep phenotyping, and Electronic health records for Heart Failure subtypes and treatment targets is to provide overall management and oversight for HeartShare, including coordination and communication across all subsections and cores of the program, and with the 4 HeartShare Clinical Centers (CCs). The Data Translation Center (DTC) will need to ensure timely completion of the retrospective and prospective components of HeartShare. In our application, we demonstrate the ability and prior experience of our multi-PI team and core leaders in the conduct and leadership of large-scale, multi-center studies, particularly in the realms of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), electronic health record (EHR)-based investigation, deep phenotyping, machine learning, and biorepositories. For both the retrospective and prospective HeartShare components, the Northwestern DTC will leverage its considerable experience in: (1) cohorts and trials that have data on adjudicated HF patients, and (2) its leadership and track record as the top enroller in HFpEF trials/studies to ensure optimal recruitment by the HeartShare CCs. We will also leverage our expertise in HFpEF, data coordination/management, BioData Catalyst, EHR-based research, biostatistics, machine learning, multi-omics, human-computer interaction, and mobile health data monitoring to (1) successfully execute the HeartShare program and (2) meet the HeartShare DTC goals of providing a rich resource to the research community to advance the science of next-generation phenomics to identify HFpEF subtypes and therapeutic targets. Our HeartShare DTC will carry out each of its 4 primary responsibilities. (1) The Administrative and Outreach Core will oversee HeartShare program operations, research skills development, and capitation to CCs for deep phenotyping costs; support a call center to follow patient outcomes; and promote rapid and broad data-sharing of clinical and molecular data. (2) The Data Portal Core will serve as the primary access point (via a web-based interface) and coordinating center for all HeartShare data; and to develop an interactive patient-facing web-based interface for remote consent, completion of forms, and collection of mobile health data using BioData Catalyst tools. (3) The Data Management Core will oversee ensure data quality, integration and harmonization of various data types; perform advanced analytics; coordinate biospecimen and imaging biorepositories; and integrate with TOPMed for omics analyses. (4) The Cohort Core will aggregate data on HF patients from completed epidemiology cohorts and HF trials and will combine data with further bioprofiling of existing samples to allow discovery/validation of novel targets. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The Northwestern HeartShare Data Translation Center will provide overall management and oversight of the HeartShare program via 4 cores, including Administrative/Outreach, Data Portal, Data Management, and Cohort Cores. By providing a diverse investigative team and complementary areas of expertise, the HeartShare Data Translation Center will achieve the primary goals of HeartShare: (1) to develop a rich resource for the research community for the detailed study of heart failure; and (2) to advance the science of identifying novel heart failure subtypes to promote a tailored, precision medicine approach to heart failure patients in order to reduce morbidity and mortality.","HeartShare DeCODE-HF: Data translation center to Combine Omics, Deep phenotyping, and Electronic health records for Heart Failure subtypes and treatment targets",10327457,U54HL160273,"['Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Crystallization ', ' Data Aggregation ', ' Aggregated Data ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Goals ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Medicine ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Operations Research ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Science ', ' Standardization ', ' statistics ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' catalyst ', ' base ', ' computer human interaction ', ' man-machine interaction ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological Specimen Banks ', ' Biological Substance Banks ', ' biological specimen repository ', ' biosample repository ', ' biospecimen bank ', ' biospecimen repository ', ' specimen bank ', ' specimen repository ', ' Ensure ', ' Failure ', ' data quality ', ' Collaborations ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Research Priority ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Ejection Fraction ', ' EFRAC ', ' meetings ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' outreach ', ' Sampling ', ' Committee Members ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' International ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Collection ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Ontology ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' Cardiac ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' working group ', ' work group ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' cost ', ' data integration ', ' Data Coordinating Center ', ' Data Coordination Center ', ' next generation ', ' adjudicate ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' skill acquisition ', ' skill development ', ' image archival system ', ' Image data archive ', ' image archive ', ' image library ', ' image repository ', ' imaging repository ', ' picture archive ', ' web based interface ', ' therapeutic target ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' data portal ', ' data sharing portal ', ' phenomics ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' health data ', ' Data Science ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' phenotypic data ', ' Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine ', ' TOPMed ', ' recruit ', ' preservation ', ' Data Scientist ', ' advanced analytics ', ' clinical center ', ' electronic consent ', ' e-Consent ', ' eConsent ', ' remote consent ', ' remote informed consent ', ' ']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,U54,2021,3338507,IL-07
"Magnesium supplement and vascular health: Machine learning from the longitudinal medical record Project Summary/Abstract Over half of adult Americans use dietary supplements. However, little is known about their safety and effectiveness as these products are not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and post-marketing surveillance is limited to adverse events. The NIH Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) seeks to fill in that gap and has identified electronic health record (EHR) data as a potential tool to advance that goal. Preliminary data from our pilot study sponsored by the NIH ODS that used advanced machine/deep learning techniques suggest that magnesium supplements may lower the risk of heart failure (HF) in patient with diabetes mellitus (DM) and may improve outcomes in those with HF. Both HF and DM affect the health and outcomes of millions of Americans. DM is a risk factor for HF and adversely affects outcomes in those with HF. Magnesium is an integral part of over 300 human enzyme systems, which are impaired in magnesium deficiency. Findings from our study suggest that a low dietary magnesium intake is associated with a higher risk of incident HF, especially among those with DM. However, less is known about this relationship in patients with HF. The Specific Aims 1 and 2 of the proposed projects are to test the hypotheses that a new prescription for oral magnesium supplement is associated with a lower risk of incident HF in those with DM and of mortality and hospitalization in patients with HF. Although magnesium is inexpensive and relatively safe, its long-term effects may vary for individual patients. Thus, instead of recommending it to millions of patients, it would be ideal to recommend to individuals who are most likely to benefit. Thus, our Specific Aim 3 is to develop and validate a novel explainable deep learning-based risk prediction model to determine with precision the optimal clinical setting under which an individual may derive clinical benefits from magnesium supplementation given their individual characteristics including multimorbidity and polypharmacy. These aims will be achieved by interrogating the Veterans Affairs (VA) national EHR data that includes over 2 million Veterans with DM and 1 million with HF with ~20 years of longitudinal data on magnesium supplements, serum magnesium, and outcomes. We will use a new-user design, marginal structural model (propensity score weighting) with machine- learning-based estimation and stability analyses to minimize confounding and account for potential biases. The prediction model for individual risk/benefit will be validated using the Cerner Health Facts® data for generalizability in non-Veteran populations. The findings of proposed study will generate new evidence that will have direct clinical implications and those of Aim 3 specifically will provide a novel precision medicine tool to individualize magnesium supplement use. Project Narrative About 6 million Americans suffer from heart failure and one third of the patients with heart failure die within a year of the diagnosis. While lower blood magnesium levels have been linked with the incident and outcomes of heart failure, it is unknown whether magnesium supplements (~$0.05 each pill) may lower that risk. We propose to interrogate national electronic health record data from Veterans Health Administration using novel pharmacoepidemiology methodology and develop explainable deep-learning models to help clinicians and patients make personalized decisions to maximize the health benefits of magnesium supplements.",Magnesium supplement and vascular health: Machine learning from the longitudinal medical record,10301239,R01HL156518,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Laboratory Animals ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Calcium ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Inflammation ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Magnesium ', ' Mg element ', ' Magnesium Deficiency ', ' Marketing ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methodology ', ' Minerals ', ' Structural Models ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Safety ', ' Serum magnesium level observed ', ' Serum Magnesium Level ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' USFDA ', ' United States Department of Veterans Affairs ', ' United States Veterans Administration ', ' Veterans Administration ', ' Veterans Affairs ', ' Veterans ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Hypomagnesemia ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Polypharmacy ', ' Clinical ', ' Pharmacoepidemiology ', ' Pharmaceutical Epidemiology ', ' drug epidemiology ', ' pharmacoepidemiologic ', ' pharmacoepidemiological ', ' Link ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Individual ', ' dietary supplements ', ' diet supplement ', ' nutritional supplement ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Sample Size ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Oral ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' insulin sensitivity ', ' pill ', ' diabetes risk ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' Longterm Follow-up ', ' Long-term Follow-up ', ' long-term followup ', ' longterm followup ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Cardiac ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' active comparator ', ' Dietary Magnesium ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Impairment ', ' therapeutic effectiveness ', ' high risk ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' multimorbidity ', ' endothelial dysfunction ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' individual patient ', ' improved outcome ', ' phenotypic data ', ' personalized decision ', ' individualized clinical decision ', ' individualized decision ', ' personalized clinical decision ', ' personalized data-driven decision ', ' Mg supplementation ', ' Magnesium supplementation ', ' Supplementation with magnesium ', ' deep learning ', ' risk prediction model ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' randomized controlled design ', ' Veterans Health Administration ', ' Veterans Health Affairs ', ' ']",NHLBI,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,459597,DC-98
"Outpatient Worsening Heart Failure in an Integrated Health Care Delivery System: An Innovative Approach to Characterizing a Novel Clinical Entity PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Although the management of ambulatory heart failure (HF) has been revolutionized by evidence-based drug and device therapies, there has been no such parallel progress in the care of patients admitted for worsening HF (WHF). To incentivize health systems to reduce 30-day readmissions, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) launched the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP) in 2012, which penalizes hospitals financially if they have higher than expected risk-adjusted 30-day readmission rates for conditions including HF. Although the HRRP has modestly reduced readmissions, this program has had the unintended consequence of shifting a significant fraction of HF-related care to the outpatient setting. Thus, there is a growing interest in the field to disentangle WHF from location of care and move away from using hospitalization as a surrogate for acute decompensated HF. However, little is known about the epidemiology, clinical profile, treatment patterns, and/or outcomes of outpatient WHF. In addition, while the overall survival of ambulatory HF patients has improved dramatically, guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) has had minimal impact on impairments in health- related quality of life (HRQOL). Despite this reality, there are few real-world data sources available to describe the trajectory of HRQOL in the ambulatory setting. To address these critical knowledge gaps, we propose (1) to systematically describe the contemporary epidemiology, clinical characteristics, treatment patterns, and outcomes associated with outpatient WHF and (2) to evaluate the impact of an episode of outpatient WHF on generic and disease-specific HRQOL in the context of a fully integrated health care delivery system. The first objective will leverage observational data from a large, state-of-the-art, and validated electronic health record (EHR) system and machine learning algorithms for natural language processing (NLP) to systematically ascertain and comprehensively characterize episodes of outpatient WHF. The second objective will prospectively apply this software-based solution to evaluate generic and disease-specific HRQOL among patients with a recent clinical encounter for outpatient WHF. The overarching goal of this career development award is to provide me with the requisite training in research methodology and project experience to build upon my past successes as a traditional clinical trialist in order to also becoming a leader in health services, implementation science, and pragmatic clinical trials within a learning health system. Strengths of my proposal include my prior relevant training and track record in research, the experience and commitment of my mentors, collaborators, and consultants, and the vast institutional resources and support. In summary, this research proposal will employ innovative analytic approaches to elucidate the epidemiology, clinical features, and outcomes of this previously underappreciated and novel clinical entity. Given the current trend towards managing acute cardiac conditions primarily in the ambulatory setting, these findings have immediate implications for formulating public health policy as well as the design and conduct of future clinical trials.

"Mentoring Patient Oriented Research in Innovative Imaging and High-dimensional Data Approaches to Improve Outcomes in Cardiac Amyloidosis Project Summary/Abstract Dr Sharmila Dorbala is an Associate Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and a physician/scientist at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH). She has devoted her career to patient-oriented research focusing on cardiac amyloidosis. She contributed independently to the field of cardiac amyloidosis through a succession of substantive studies utilizing molecular imaging to phenotype cardiac amyloidosis in order to diagnose and manage this condition. Her research program is impactful, both directly and through effective mentoring of the next generation of amyloidosis investigators. Dr. Dorbala has successfully mentored 26 pre- and post-doctoral trainees in patient- oriented research projects. She is currently PI of two active NIH R01 grants and also has funding from AHA and foundation/industrial sources. Her program provides a unique opportunity for POR due to the intersection of resources from programs in clinical investigation at the Harvard School of Public Health and the BWH cardiovascular imaging T32 program. Her mentees have presented their work nationally and internationally, published papers, and won research awards and pilot grants. The new research aims proposed in this award lay the foundation for adjunct interventions to enhance transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR-CA) therapies and novel image-based personalized strategies to predict treatment failure. She will assess (1) sonoporation, a therapeutic ultrasound technique to increase myocardial perfusion and, consequently, improve delivery of antifibril drugs; (2) shotgun metagenomic sequencing of the gut microbiome to inform development of nutrition-based adjunct therapies; (3) radiomics of 99mTc- pyrophosphate SPECT/CT to assess treatment response, and (4) machine learning based CT-derived sarcopenia metric to predict survival. This research has important clinical implications. Currently approved TTR stabilizing/silencing drugs, though lifesaving for most, are not effective in about 30% of patients. Moreover, while these therapies improve clinical outcomes, they do not treat amyloid fibril. Fibril-targeted therapies have been unsuccessful to date, probably because of poor interstitial drug delivery due to the presence of fibril. The results of the proposed mentoring and research activities of this K24 project are likely to not only substantially improve outcomes and alleviate HF symptoms in these gravely ill patients, but also transform her patient- oriented research program into a formal individualized program of mentoring with a focus on preventing heart failure from amyloidosis. Project Narrative Transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis, a particularly deadly form of heart failure, can now be treated by recently developed medications. The proposed projects will develop new heart imaging approaches to determine who is likely to respond to the new medicines, test a new ultrasound-based therapy to improve blood flow to the heart muscle and thereby improve delivery of novel drugs to the heart, and study bacteria in the stool with the goal of eventually developing diet-based strategies to address cardiac amyloidosis. In developing methods to improve treatments for amyloidosis, this project will support expansion of Dr. Dorbala’s patient oriented research program and enhance training for her mentees.",Mentoring

"QT prolonging medications and sudden cardiac death among individuals on hemodialysis PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Individuals receiving maintenance hemodialysis (HD) have exceedingly high mortality, driven largely by cardiovascular events. The rate of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the HD population exceeds that of the general population by more than 20-fold. Risk factors for SCD such as structural heart disease and conduction abnormalities are common among people with end-stage kidney disease, but traditional preventive strategies, such as antiarrhythmic medications and implantable cardioverter defibrillators, do not lower SCD risk in HD patients. However, medication-provoked SCD may be preventable, and, to-date, has been understudied in HD patients. Dialysis patients are often prescribed medications that have the undesirable, off-target effect of delayed ventricular repolarization, which manifests as QT-interval prolongation on an electrocardiogram, and can trigger fatal arrhythmias. Although more than 50% of dialysis patients are prescribed medications that can prolong the QT-interval (e.g. certain antidepressants, antibiotics, antiemetics), there are critical knowledge gaps about the cardiac safety of these medications. In fact, their safety profiles rest on data obtained from healthy volunteers and have not been explicitly evaluated in HD patients. By executing the proposed studies, we will provide a comprehensive understanding of the essential safety data relevant to the prescription of non- cardiac QT-prolonging medications to HD patients. In Aim 1, we will determine the relative SCD risk of the most commonly prescribed non-cardiac medications with higher QT-prolonging potential vs. clinically relevant comparator medications with lower QT-prolonging potential among HD patients. In Aim 2, we will identify modifiable clinical factors (e.g. dialysate composition and concurrent prescription medications) that may be targeted to mitigate SCD risk from QT-prolonging medications. In Aim 3, we will identify prescribers of higher risk QT-prolonging medications and associated encounters that should prompt medication reconciliation and decision support tool use. Then, in Aim 4, we will develop individualized decision support tools for QT- prolonging medication prescribing that integrate many comorbid conditions, HD treatment, and medication- related risk factors. This work will yield decision support tools that facilitate personalized SCD risk assessments and safer prescribing of QT-prolonging medications to reduce SCD risk among HD patients. Moreover, the decision support tools generated in this project will serve as the subject of future pragmatic trials testing the impact of tool implementation on cardiovascular outcomes.

"Rapid Comprehensive Cardiac MRI Exam for Diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in the United States. The clinical gold standards to diagnose and guide treatment of patients with CAD are based on invasive catheter-based procedures, such as x-ray coronary angiography (XCA) for anatomic assessment or fractional flow reserve (FFR) for physiologic assessment. However, there are costs and risks associated with such invasive procedures. Such concerns are further highlighted by the fact that large studies have shown nearly two-thirds of patients referred for their initial elective invasive XCA were found to have no significant stenoses. Thus, better non-invasive diagnostic tools are needed. Cardiac MRI (CMR) is the only non-invasive imaging modality that provides a comprehensive assessment of CAD in a single examination, including an assessment of myocardial perfusion, cardiac function and viability, as well as angiographic evaluation of stenoses, without requiring ionizing radiation. These properties also allow for repeat testing as may be clinically indicated. However, despite its great potential to serve as the non- invasive gatekeeper for costly invasive procedures, lengthy examination times have prevented CMR from clinical translation. Although several accelerated imaging techniques have been proposed, these still require trade-offs between coverage, resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. In this proposal, we will develop and validate novel acquisition and reconstruction strategies to enable a highly accelerated high-resolution whole heart CMR exam for comprehensive CAD assessment in under 10 minutes. We will develop fast and low specific absorption rate outer volume suppression modules to reduce the source of aliasing artifacts from the chest and the back. This will enable higher rates for simultaneous multi-slice imaging in perfusion and cine CMR, improving coverage substantially with minimal noise amplification. For coronary MRI and viability imaging, simultaneous multi-slab imaging will be introduced to CMR, facilitating high isotropic resolution acquisitions with fast coverage. These acquisitions will be supplemented with regularized leakage-blocking and patient- specific machine learning reconstructions for further artifact and noise removal. Finally, we will implement and validate the proposed rapid comprehensive CMR exam in a cohort of suspected CAD patients, comparing our approach with conventional clinical CMR for the assessment of function, perfusion, and viability, and with invasive XCA for the assessment of coronary stenosis. Successful completion of this project has the potential to transform CMR into a leading rapid non-invasive tool for safe and accurate diagnosis of CAD, improving the healthcare of several million patients with chest pain and other CAD symptoms annually. PROJECT NARRATIVE Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for one in six deaths. Cardiac MRI is a non-invasive non-ionizing technique for comprehensive evaluation of CAD, but its clinical translation is hampered by lengthy exam times.

"Integrated prediction of cardiovascular events by automated coronary plaque and pericoronary adipose tissue quantification from CT Angiography PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering myocardial infarction (heart attacks) have no premonitory symptoms. Studies of patients with coronary artery disease have traditionally focused only on the severity of narrowing (stenosis) of the coronary arteries by atherosclerotic plaques, rather than the adverse features of coronary plaques which are predisposed to rupture and precipitate myocardial infarction. Coronary CT Angiography (CTA) is a noninvasive test that allows assessment of both coronary stenosis and plaque characteristics. Currently, however, CTA is interpreted visually for stenosis. Quantitative measurements of CTA stenosis severity and plaque features are not part of current clinical routine.  We propose to develop novel image processing algorithms for fully automated, robust quantification of coronary plaque features from CTA. We also propose to automatically quantify the characteristics of adipose tissue around the coronary arteries (pericoronary adipose tissue, PCAT), which have been shown to differentiate rupture-prone, high-risk coronary plaques from stable ones. We propose to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine stenosis, plaque and PCAT features, along with patient clinical data, into a new integrated risk score for the prediction of future adverse cardiovascular events. We will evaluate this risk score in the real-world, prospective, landmark SCOT-HEART trial (including all 2073 patients in the CTA arm of the trial), with added external validation in large multicenter patient registries, with available CTA scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiovascular events (fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death in a grand total of 7844 patients). We propose three specific aims: 1) To refine, expand and automate measurements of coronary plaque and lumen for the entire coronary artery tree, and to standardize measurement of plaque changes in serial CTA; 2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified plaque features and PCAT characteristics for the prediction of future MACE in the prospective SCOT-HEART trial and multicenter CTA registries; 3) To develop and evaluate with full external validation a new automated patient risk score—combining patient clinical data, CTA-measured quantitative plaque features and PCAT characteristics, using machine learning—for the prediction of future MACE events in the prospective SCOT-HEART trial and multicenter CTA registries.  The proposed work will enable automated, multi-faceted and reproducible analysis of plaque, stenosis and PCAT from CTA, combined with objective risk scores reflecting likelihood of adverse cardiovascular events. This work will provide a novel, personalized, real-world paradigm that objectively and accurately identifies individual patients at risk of future cardiovascular events, from routine CTA imaging. PROJECT NARRATIVE (lay language) In patients who are at risk of developing a heart attack, imaging of the heart with coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) allows doctors to noninvasively assess the narrowing of the coronary arteries caused by coronary plaque deposits, as well as the coronary plaques themselves. The researchers propose to develop and validate novel computerized scores derived from real-world CTA and clinical patient data using artificial intelligence, that will automatically identify the patients who are at highest risk of suffering a heart attack or cardiovascular death. This new research will allow physicians to more precisely identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed, to reduce their risk of future adverse cardiovascular events.",Integrated prediction of cardiovascular events by automated coronary plaque and pericoronary adipose tissue quantification from CT Angiography,10165813,R01HL148787,"['Adipose tissue ', ' Fatty Tissue ', ' adipose ', ' white adipose tissue ', ' yellow adipose tissue ', ' Algorithms ', ' Angiography ', ' Angiogram ', ' angiographic imaging ', ' Arteries ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Arterial Fatty Streak ', ' Arterial Fatty Streaks ', ' Atheroma ', ' Atheromatous ', ' Atheromatous degeneration ', ' Atheromatous plaque ', ' atherosclerosis plaque ', ' atherosclerotic lesions ', ' atherosclerotic plaque ', ' vulnerable plaque ', ' Future ', ' Hospitals ', ' indexing ', ' Language ', ' Manuals ', ' mortality ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary infarction ', ' heart attack ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart infarction ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Trees ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' density ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Coronary artery ', ' Cardiac artery ', ' Heart artery ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Coronary Stenosis ', ' Coronary Artery Stenosis ', ' Measurement ', ' noninvasive diagnosis ', ' non-invasive diagnosis ', ' non-invasive diagnostic ', ' noninvasive diagnostic ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Cardiac Death ', ' Hour ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cardiac imaging ', ' cardiac scanning ', ' heart scanning ', ' heart imaging ', ' novel ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' patient registry ', ' acute coronary syndrome ', ' Pathologic Constriction ', ' Pathological Constriction ', ' Stenosis ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Longterm Follow-up ', ' Long-term Follow-up ', ' long-term followup ', ' longterm followup ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Coronary ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' computerized ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Rupture ', ' prospective ', ' Consumption ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' high risk ', ' coronary computed tomography angiography ', ' arm ', ' Patient risk ', ' prognostic value ', ' prognostic ability ', ' prognostic power ', ' prognostic utility ', ' individual patient ', ' prognostic significance ', ' coronary calcium scoring ', ' coronary artery calcium scoring ', ' coronary plaque ', ' coronary event ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,684863,CA-28
"A ROBOT-ASSISTED PERFUSION SYSTEM TO IMPROVE PATIENT SAFETY IN THE CARDIAC OPERATING ROOM PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  The vast majority of pediatric and adult cardiac surgery procedures worldwide involve the use of cardiopulmonary bypass with a dedicated and highly customized perfusion system. Cardiac surgery procedures are complex and entail safety-critical activities, requiring continuous coordination between four subteams: perfusion, surgical, nursing and anesthesia. This environment demands outstanding technical and non-technical skills (e.g. teamwork, communication and situational awareness).  Over the past few decades, technological advancements have improved the safety and efficiency of the perfusion system, however, despite substantial progress, recent studies continue to report a high incidence of preventable intraoperative adverse events among cardiac surgery patients. The perfusion system, in particular, relies heavily on the expertise and skills of the perfusionist, and there is currently no computational intelligent system to support perfusionists’ optimal decision-making during the critical phase of cardiopulmonary bypass.  In this proposal, we seek to develop a data-driven approach to learn from expert perfusionists how to achieve optimal outcomes for cardiac surgery patients. Rather than attempt to engineer a solution, we propose to develop a robot apprentice that can learn from high-quality demonstrations of perfusionist actions to infer gold- standard patient care. Our goal is to develop and evaluate a Robot-Assisted Perfusion System (RAPS) that can be integrated into the cardiac surgery workflow as a non-human teammate. The RAPS will support the perfusion team in a way that perfusionists still will keep control of the perfusion system (i.e. human-in-the-loop), but cognitively supported and guided by the RAPS. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this study, we seek to develop a system that will learn from expert perfusionists in the cardiac operating room and will be integrated into the surgical workflow as an artificial intelligence (AI) teammate.

"Machine learning techniques for passive, remote monitoring of elderly heart failure patients from home Abstract Heart failure (HF) is the most common cause for both hospitalizations and readmissions in the Medicare program. HF’s high mortality rate and high hospitalization utilization rate via readmissions results in a large economic burden currently estimated at over $30B, and prevalence of HF is expected to continue rising by 46% by 2030. There is an opportunity to deploy remote patient monitoring (RPM) tools for measuring prognostic biomarkers of worsening HF and acute decompensation and hospital readmission. Bender Tech (BT) has developed a urine testing platform capable of easily attaching to a home-toilet for accurate and easy collection of longitudinal health and behavior data without the requirement of manual sample collection and/or testing. We propose to adapt our system for use in elderly HF patient populations by rendering data collection and transmission completely passive. We propose to integrate sensors and firmware capable of identifying when a user has used their home toilet (Specific Aim 1), develop the machine learning (ML) classification algorithms necessary for determining when to perform a testing sequence (Specific Aim 2), and use ML methods to demonstrate feasibility of user biometric identification via urinary testing data (Specific Aim 3). A successful outcome of this proposal will be a set of classification models built using ML techniques designed to enable passive collection of longitudinal urine profile data from a home-toilet for use in remotely managing elderly HF patients. This will ready the product for prospective clinical trials that would be the subject of a future phase II submission for use in remotely monitoring diuretic effectiveness and preventing hospital readmissions. Project Narrative Remotely stratifying risk of worsening heart failure and predicting imminent decompensation and hospitalizations using remote patient monitoring devices can help lower healthcare costs and improve lives for the elderly living with heart failure at home. Longitudinal urinary trend data of physiologically important markers, such as spot sodium tests, have been shown to help classify potentially stable heart failure patients, predict acute decompensation, and measure diuretic effectiveness via relative changes from baseline measurements. Bender Tech proposes to integrate the hardware and machine learning methods necessary to render its internet- connected home urine testing platform completely passive to enable use by the elderly HF population and obviate any need for device interaction for data collection and transmission.","Machine learning techniques for passive, remote monitoring of elderly heart failure patients from home",10187779,R43HL157937,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Cardiology ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Data Collection ', ' Defecation ', ' bowel movement ', ' Diuretics ', ' Engineering ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Potassium ', ' K element ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Sleep ', ' Societies ', ' Sodium ', ' Na element ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Urination ', ' micturition ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Use Effectiveness ', ' Measures ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' therapy failure ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Acute ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Measurement ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Spottings ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Test Result ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' patient monitoring device ', ' Performance ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' Devices ', ' Modeling ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' Collection ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' urinary ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' patient population ', ' data exchange ', ' data transfer ', ' data transmission ', ' health data ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' clinical decision support ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' classification algorithm ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' remote monitoring ', ' remote patient monitoring ', ' Home ', ' ']",NHLBI,"BENDER TECH, LLC",R43,2021,224996,NC-02
"Prospective sudden cardiac death risk stratification using CMR and echocardiography machine learning in mitral valve prolapse PROJECT SUMMARY Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a common valvulopathy affecting over 170 million worldwide. Every year, 0.4- 1.9% of individuals with MVP will develop sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) or sudden cardiac death (SCD), and 7% of SCDs in the young are caused by MVP. However, predictors of this devastating outcome are not readily available, and indications for a primary prevention implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) in MVP are lacking. Severe mitral regurgitation explains only 50% of SCA cases in MVP. SCD/SCA risk has also been linked to a bileaflet phenotype with mild MR, mitral annular disjunction (MAD), and left ventricular focal fibrosis on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)-late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) images. Such imaging parameters (including LGE) have not been evaluated prospectively. Moreover, they are not consistently found in SCA survivors, and diffuse fibrosis has been proposed as an alternative arrhythmic substrate by our group and others based on CMR/T1 mapping, strain echocardiography, and post-mortem data. Overall, it is challenging to pinpoint a unique imaging phenotype, and uncertainty exists about which MVP patients should undergo CMR. Regardless of arrhythmic phenotype, complex ventricular ectopy (ComVE - defined as frequent polymorphic PVCs, bigeminy or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia) is detected in 80-100% of MVP cases prior to SCA or SCD. ComVE, commonly associated with left ventricular fibrosis on CMR, is linked to higher all-cause mortality and SCA rates (20% versus 12% if no ComVE, p < 0.05) based on preliminary cross-sectional data. Our central hypothesis is that MVP patients with ComVE, because of the higher prevalence of either LGE or abnormal T1 mapping, represent ideal CMR candidates regardless of leaflet involvement or MAD, and can be rapidly identified by an automated “surveillance” tool within a large echocardiographic database. Moreover, we hypothesize that fibrosis is the strongest predictor of SCD/SCA in an unprecedented, multi-center effort to longitudinally assess clinical and CMR parameters of arrhythmic risk in MVP. Specifically, we aim to 1) Assess the role of CMR as a screening tool for fibrosis in MVP with ComVE incorporating T1 mapping in addition to LGE in an unselected MVP sample; 2) Develop an echo-based machine-learning algorithm to detect MVP with ComVE, test its association with myocardial fibrosis on CMR and longitudinal SCD/SCA risk; and 3) Build a novel prospective SCD/SCA risk prediction model in MVP. Better selection of CMR candidates and development of a SCD/SCA risk prediction tool inclusive of fibrosis by CMR are expected to dramatically improve risk stratification in MVP and establish future criteria for primary prevention ICD trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Every year, 0.4-1.9% of individuals with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) will develop sudden cardiac death or arrest. In this application we propose to better identify those at risk by using cardiac magnetic resonance and echocardiography-based artificial intelligence, with the long-term goal of selecting those that may benefit most from a defibrillator. .",Prospective sudden cardiac death risk stratification using CMR and echocardiography machine learning in mitral valve prolapse,10171903,R01HL153447,"['Affect ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' California ', ' Clinical Markers ', ' Echocardiography ', ' Echocardiogram ', ' Transthoracic Echocardiography ', ' heart sonography ', ' Holter Electrocardiography ', ' Holter Monitoring ', ' Holtmon ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Future ', ' Gadolinium ', ' Gd element ', ' Goals ', ' Heart Arrest ', ' Asystole ', ' Cardiac Arrest ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Hybrids ', ' Image Enhancement ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mission ', ' Mitral Valve Insufficiency ', ' Mitral Incompetence ', ' Mitral Insufficiency ', ' Mitral Regurgitation ', ' Mitral Valve Incompetence ', ' Mitral Valve Regurgitation ', ' Mitral Valve Prolapse ', ' Barlows Syndrome ', ' Floppy Mitral Valve ', ' Mitral Click-Murmur Syndrome ', ' Systolic Click-Murmur Syndrome ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Registries ', ' Retrospective Studies ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' San Francisco ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Ventricular Tachycardia ', ' sudden cardiac death ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Implantable Defibrillators ', ' Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators ', ' base ', ' Defibrillators ', ' Electric Shock Cardiac Stimulators ', ' Stimulators, Electrical, Cardiac, Shock ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Survivors ', ' Link ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' extracellular ', ' cardiac fibrosis ', ' myocardial fibrosis ', ' coronary fibrosis ', ' novel ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Sampling ', ' Magnetic Resonance ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Validation ', ' Myocardial ', ' Ventricular ', ' Cardiac ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' stem ', ' high risk ', ' prognostic significance ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' secondary analysis ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' neural network architecture ', ' neural net architecture ', ' risk prediction model ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,779765,CA-12
"Blood and Urine Biomarkers for Predicting Long-Term Adverse Kidney and Cardiovascular Outcomes after Cardiac Surgery PROJECT SUMMARY In the United States over 500,000 cardiac surgeries are performed annually. Postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in ~20% of cardiac surgical patients. Several cohort and registry studies have reported that AKI defined by rise in serum creatinine after cardiac surgery associates with development of chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular events. However, it is unclear which patients will develop long-term adverse kidney events, adverse cardiovascular events, or both. In recent years blood and urine AKI biomarkers have been identified that reflect different aspects of AKI biology and that detect serum creatinine defined AKI earlier than rise in serum creatinine or detect subclinical AKI that is not revealed by traditional serum creatinine assessment. Clinical outcomes and biomarker research has focused mainly on detecting cardiac surgery- associated AKI itself, but not on predicting which patients are at greatest risk for long-term adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes after AKI. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that perioperative blood and urine AKI biomarkers significantly associate with increased long-term (2 to 5 years) postoperative major adverse kidney events (MAKE) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). MAKE is defined as the composite of dialysis, death, renal hospitalization, or ≥ 30 day postoperative eGFR decline >25% from preoperative baseline. MACE is defined as the composite of death or hospitalizations for heart failure, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, arrhythmia, or stroke. We propose a prospective observational cohort study of 610 patients undergoing cardiac surgery at UT Southwestern Medical Center who will be followed for a minimum of 2 years and up to 5 years following cardiac surgery. Based on preliminary data we will assess plasma NT-pro- B-type natriuretic peptide, plasma intact fibroblast growth factor 23, serum cystatin C, urine TIMP-2*IGFBP7, and urine Kidney Injury Molecule-1 AKI biomarkers preoperatively and at 5 postoperative time points. This proposal will address three specific aims: 1) To determine the association between in-hospital AKI biomarkers and occurrence of MAKE during long-term follow-up; 2) To determine the association between in-hospital AKI biomarkers and occurrence of MACE during long-term follow-up; and 3) To develop clinical prediction models for long-term MAKE and MACE after cardiac surgery. In addition to traditional regression modeling, we will use machine learning that leverages detailed perioperative data including time-varying intraoperative and intensive care unit clinical data and blood and urine AKI biomarker data to create high performing prediction models. Our proposal is significant because knowing what blood and urine AKI biomarkers and clinical parameters accurately predict long-term major adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes after cardiac surgery provides the foundation for clinical trials that will identify effective short and long-term interventions for patients at highest risk. Our proposal is innovative because clinical and biomarker data has not been leveraged in this way to predict long-term MAKE and MACE after cardiac surgery. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because combining blood and urine acute kidney injury biomarkers and clinical data to identify cardiac surgical patients at highest risk for long-term major adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes will allow interventional studies to better individualize clinical management to prevent these outcomes. While acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery is associated with increased long-term adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes (~25% incidence), it remains unclear which patients with postoperative acute kidney injury are at highest risk.

"Inconspicuous Daily Monitoring to Reduce Heart Failure Hospitalizations Project Summary/Abstract In-home monitoring technologies have the potential to transform the healthcare system by enabling the transition from reactive care to proactive and preventive care. This is especially important for cardiovascular disease (CVD); the leading cause of death worldwide. Heart failure (HF), a type of CVD characterized by a weakened heart muscle, impacts approximately 6.5 million Americans with over 960,000 new cases each year. HF costs the US an estimated $30.7 billion annually and is expected to increase 127% to $69.7 billion by 2030. With approximately 80% of the total cost associated with HF due to hospitalization, there is an opportunity to reduce the cost of HF by lowering hospitalization rates through remote patient monitoring. Since patient awareness of symptomology often lags deterioration, successfully tracking physiologic changes in the home is a critical component of an early intervention strategy. Classical approaches to in-home monitoring, such as blood pressure and weight monitoring have had limited success, with patient adherence cited as major barrier to reducing hospitalizations. The central hypothesis of this research is that hospitalization rates and duration of stay for heart failure patients can be significantly reduced through inconspicuous in-home monitoring and early intervention. This research will leverage a highly innovative technology for cardiovascular in-home daily monitoring; the fully integrated toilet seat (FIT). The FIT seat automatically captures a comprehensive cardiovascular assessment in the home, while ensuring long-term patient adherence. A multidisciplinary research team, comprised of engineers, physicians, advanced practice providers (APP), data scientists, biostatisticians, designers, and software developers, will advance an automated system that provides health care providers with early warning of patient deterioration using the FIT system measurements captured in the home. The success of this system will be evaluated through an in-home clinical trial of heart failure patients. Specific Aim 1 seeks to create a learning dataset and data visualization architecture from HF patient in-home physiologic data, perceived wellness, and adverse events. The FIT seat will be deployed for a 90-day in-home study of 200 HF patients, with patient perceived wellness and activity captured through a custom application. This physiologic, wellness, and activity data will be combined with adverse events from the electronic medical record to create an integrated dataset for retrospective analysis and alert model development. In Aim 2, an automated prediction model for early alert of all-cause hospitalizations will be created using novel machine learning techniques. The objective of Aim 3 is to demonstrate that inconspicuous in-home monitoring and early intervention can reduce hospitalizations in a second cohort of 200 HF patients. We hypothesize that the integrated FIT-based alert system will reduce the burden of all-cause hospitalization and will improve the quality of life for patients.

"Myocardial Radiomics and Mechanics in the Pathology and Prognosis of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Though knowledge advances have been made in identification and treatment of risk factors, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death in the U.S., and has been worldwide for the past 15 years. The mechanisms of three leading sources of CVD morbidity, ischemic coronary artery disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation, appear rooted in myocardial pathophysiology of the left ventricle (LV), suggesting that deeper phenotyping of the LV may provide insight into the diseases. The detection of earliest forms of LV dysfunction has been challenging: traditional measures of LV structure and function associated with poor outcomes, such as mass and ejection fraction, reflect advanced stages of disease. However, recent advances in quantitative imaging of the LV myocardium using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) images may bridge this gap. Myocardial texture analysis is a type of ‘radiomics’, the computation of myocardial pixel intensity and patterns, which has shown the ability to differentiate pathological patterns in LV hypertrophy. Additionally, analysis of myocardial mechanics including strain and torsion have shown prognostic value in evaluation of cardiomyopathies. Thus, increasing evidence indicates roles for these technological advances in imaging analysis to evaluate pathological LV remodeling in subclinical cardiovascular disease in the general population. We hypothesize that application of these novel imaging analytics, correlated with biology, subclinical disease phenotyping, and outcomes, will enable more granular insight into subclinical LV structural and functional changes predating overt CVD and its forms. The Framingham and Jackson Heart Studies, community-based cohorts of whites and African Americans with longitudinal follow up, offer the opportunity to gain insight in CVD development through integration of advanced secondary imaging analysis with detailed and broad phenotyping and genotyping, and clinical end-points. Thus, the objectives of our proposal are threefold: 1) to first identify myocardial texture analysis and mechanics patterns associated with prevalent CVD and risk factors, 2) to define the biological and genetic underpinnings of these phenotypes, and 3) to understand their inter-association between structure and function, and their joint relations with long-term prognosis. Execution of our Aims will elucidate novel patterns, determinants, and prognosis of underlying early and progressive myocardial remodeling and dysfunction in CVD in a large bi-racial cohort. Ultimately, our goal is for knowledge gained from this study to advance phenotyping of LV remodeling groups, methods of cardiovascular risk stratification, and development of therapies for patient care. NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of mortality in the U.S., but its multi-factorial mechanisms and early detection are not well established. Applying new analyses of cardiovascular magnetic resonance images and integrating these measures with broad existing data including risk factors, genetics, and blood biomarkers, we will obtain deeper understanding of structure and function of the heart in older aged white and African American adults.

"Deformable motion compensation for 3D image-guided interventional radiology PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT C-arm cone-beam CT (CBCT) plays an increasing role in guidance of interventional radiology (IR) procedures in the abdo- men, with special emphasis in embolization procedures, such as transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or transarterial embolization (TAE) for control of internal hemorrhage. However, relatively long scan time of CBCT results in artifacts arising from organ motion (respiratory and cardiac motion and peristalsis). This poses a significant challenge to guidance in interventional radiology: for example, motion artifacts were found to render up to 25% of CBCT images un-interpretable in image-guided TACE, and 18% in CBCT-guided emergency TAE. The impact of motion is most significant in cases of single or isolated lesions treated with selective embolization that requires visual- ization of very small vascular structures. Existing motion correction methods often invoke assumption of periodicity, lim- iting their applicability outside of cardiac and respiratory motions, or rely on fiducial tracking or gated acquisition that disrupt IR workflow and/or increase radiation dose. Therefore, the application of CBCT in image-guided interventional procedures in the abdomen would significantly benefit from new methods that estimate complex deformable motion directly from image data. “Autofocus” techniques based on maximization of a regularized image sharpness criterion were shown to yield effective patient motion compensation in extremity, head and cardiac CBCT. However, current applications of such methods are limited to rigid motions. We hypothesize that deformable organ motion compensation in interven- tional soft-tissue CBCT can be achieved with advanced autofocus techniques using multiple locally rigid regions of in- terest, preconditioned with basic motion characteristics obtained through a machine learning decision framework. The following aims will be pursued: 1) Develop a joint multi-region autofocus optimization method to compensate deforma- ble organ motion. This includes incorporation into a comprehensive artifacts correction and image reconstruction pipe- line, design of multi-stage optimization schedules for convergence acceleration, and performance evaluation in deforma- ble phantoms, and cadaver and animal experiments. 2) Develop a decision framework for preconditioning of the motion compensation method through a combination of projection-based approaches for physiological signal estimations (res- piratory cycle) and a multi-input, multi-branch, deep learning architecture trained on extremely realistic simulated data that will estimate basic properties of motion (spatial distribution of amplitude, direction, and frequency) from an initial motion-contaminated image and its associated raw projection data. 3) Evaluate deformable motion compensation in animal experiments and in a clinical study in 50 cases of CBCT-guided TACE and assess image quality via expert observer evaluation of satisfaction and utility. The proposed work will yield a robust, practical method for compensation of deform- able soft-tissue motion in CBCT, removing a critical impediment to 3D guidance in IR. The deformable autofocus frame- work will be applicable to other interventions in which soft-tissue motion diminishes CBCT guidance, such as image-guided radiation therapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Interventional Cone Beam CT (CBCT) provides critical 3D information to guide minimally-invasive procedures in the abdomen, but CBCT image quality is often compromised by organ deformation due to breathing, cardiac, and peristaltic motions. We propose a novel framework to mitigate the effects of this complex deformable motion using only the CBCT image data, without a need for gating, external trackers, or fiducial markers. This algorithm will remove a major impediment to 3D guidance in procedures such as transcatheter embolization procedures in the abdomen.",Deformable motion compensation for 3D image-guided interventional radiology,10100337,R01EB030547,"['Abdomen ', ' Abdominal ', ' Acceleration ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Angiography ', ' Angiogram ', ' angiographic imaging ', ' Animals ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Arteries ', ' Breathing ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' inspiration ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Cadaver ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Therapeutic Embolization ', ' Embolization Therapy ', ' Embolotherapy ', ' embolization ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Exhibits ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Fluoroscopy ', ' Head ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Primary carcinoma of the liver cells ', ' Hepatocarcinoma ', ' Hepatocellular Carcinoma ', ' Hepatocellular cancer ', ' Hepatoma ', ' Liver Cells Carcinoma ', ' liver carcinoma ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' Joints ', ' Learning ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Patients ', ' Pelvis ', ' Pelvic ', ' Pelvic Region ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Peristalsis ', ' Play ', ' Interventional radiology ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Spatial Distribution ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' Work ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Schedule ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Animal Experiments ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Compensation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' soft tissue ', ' satisfaction ', ' radiologist ', ' Morphology ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' respiratory ', ' Radiation Dose ', ' Radiation Dose Unit ', ' cardiac motion ', ' heart motion ', ' Performance ', ' internal control ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Chemotherapy Embolization ', ' Chemoembolization ', ' Modeling ', ' preconditioning ', ' Property ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' 3-D Images ', ' 3-D image ', ' 3D image ', ' 3D images ', ' Three-Dimensional Image ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Arterial Embolization ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Cardiac ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cone-beam computed tomography ', ' cone-beam CT ', ' volume CT ', ' volume computed tomography ', ' volumetric computed tomography ', ' feeding ', ' image guided intervention ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Prostate Ablation ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' tumor ', ' minimally invasive ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' arm ', ' image guided radiation therapy ', ' IGRT ', ' image guided radiation treatment ', ' image-guided radiotherapy ', ' image guided ', ' image guidance ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' Visualization ', ' porcine model ', ' pig model ', ' piglet model ', ' swine model ', ' ']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,368438,MD-07
"Scalable platform for optimizing human cardiac tissue engineering via optical pacing and on-demand oxygenation PROJECT SUMMARY Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPS-CM) are emerging as an invaluable in vitro human experimental platform for disease modeling, drug discovery, cardiotoxicity screening, gene editing and functional genomics. For the first time, cardiac electrophysiology has access to a scalable human experimental model, which, currently, offers the only path to personalized (cardiac) medicine as patient-derived iPS-CMs can be generated on a progressively faster time scale. The clear potential of this technology motivates efforts to address the main criticisms facing iPS-CMs, namely the need for further maturation and reduction of phenotype heterogeneity. As multiple approaches are being pursued to improve iPS-CM maturation and to approximate the functionality of the adult human myocardium, we argue that combinatorial optimizations necessitate new high-throughput (HT) technology and automation. The overall goal of this project is to develop and validate a scalable platform for optimizing cardiac tissue engineering via chronic reconfigurable optical pacing and “on-demand” oxygenation for gaining mechanistic insights into cardiac metabolism and electrophysiology, a platform we call ChROME. Chronic electrical stimulation is a viable lead to iPS-CM maturation, yet it has remained under-explored, specifically as related to the role of mass transport and oxygenation during such stimulation. Leveraging our expertise in the theoretical and experimental use of optogenetic tools for cardiac applications (Entcheva) and automation (Kostov, Li, Entcheva, Kay), we propose to design and validate the first-generation HT-ChROME platform, that will integrate continuous monitoring of key physiological parameters. Our team’s expertise in optical oxygen sensing (Kostov), in-house manufacturing of “on-demand” oxygenation nanocarriers (perfluorocarbons, PFC) (Kay) and metabolic characterization (Kay, Beard) will be applied to address the increased metabolic demands during stimulation. The ability to quantify “functional maturation” by relevant measures (voltage, calcium, contraction) in a high-throughput manner (Entcheva) in 2D and 3D cardiac tissue constructs (Vunjak-Novakovic), using our automated platform OptoDyCE (all-optical dynamic cardiac electrophysiology) is critical in this undertaking. Employing these HT tools and other imaging and omics modalities (Popratiloff, Horvath), we will elucidate the spectrum of responses triggered by chronic stimulation of iPS-CMs: beneficial/maturation effects vs. pathological overload effects, depending on load and oxygenation conditions. The proposed HT-ChROME platform represents a critical step in resolving issues impeding progress with iPS-CMs to accelerate their wide-spread adoption in basic and translational applications. The obtained large-scale data will inform a new generation of biophysical models linking human cardiac metabolism and electrophysiology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent advances in stem-cell technology enable patient-derived cells to be turned into functional heart cells, and this is an exciting direction towards personalized medicine; yet, there are many challenges in optimizing these cardiomyocytes to better mimic the real heart – a problem that the proposed engineering tools will help resolve.",Scalable platform for optimizing human cardiac tissue engineering via optical pacing and on-demand oxygenation,10093123,R01HL144157,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Automation ', ' Calcium ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Electric Stimulation ', ' Electrical Stimulation ', ' electrostimulation ', ' Engineering ', ' Fluorocarbons ', ' Perfluorocarbons ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Heart ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hip region structure ', ' Coxa ', ' Hip ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Engineering ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incubators ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Medicine ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Myocardium ', ' cardiac muscle ', ' heart muscle ', ' NADH ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Oxygen ', ' O element ', ' O2 element ', ' Oxygen Consumption ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Experimental Models ', ' Mediating ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Link ', ' Cardiac Myocytes ', ' Cardiac Muscle Cells ', ' Cardiocyte ', ' Heart Muscle Cells ', ' Heart myocyte ', ' cardiomyocyte ', ' insight ', ' Metabolic ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Viral ', ' bioengineered tissue ', ' engineered tissue ', ' Tissue Engineering ', ' cardiac metabolism ', ' heart metabolism ', ' voltage ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Modality ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' high throughput technology ', ' functional genomics ', ' Cardiac Toxicity ', ' Cardiotoxic ', ' Cardiotoxicity ', ' Cardiac Electrophysiological Diagnostics ', ' cardiac electrophysiology ', ' Cardiac Electrophysiologic Techniques ', ' drug discovery ', ' heart cell ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Cardiac ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' nanocarrier ', ' nano carrier ', ' transcriptomics ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' iPS ', ' iPSC ', ' iPSCs ', ' stem cell technology ', ' optogenetics ', ' screening ', ' Combinatorial Optimization ', ' biophysical model ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' cardiac tissue engineering ', ' engineered heart tissue ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' side effect ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' ']",NHLBI,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,690516,DC-98
"Towards autonomous management of cardiogenic shock Project Summary  Physicians in the cardiac intensive care unit (CCU) make decisions in an increasingly data- and knowledge- rich world, yet often they get little help. Currently, each physician makes decisions based on his or her mental model of the patient’s physiology, together with mental predictions of the patient’s response to intervention. This approach can lead to a range of behaviors that compromise patient outcomes, including oversimplification of the physiology, errors due to cognitive overload, and physician to physician variability in decision making. A computational tool equipped with quantitative knowledge of physiology, the ability to systematically evaluate all the data, and informed by a database of past action-outcome events could aid the physician with valuable suggestions for action.  We propose to train an algorithm to make decisions about dosing vasoactive medications and initiating mechanical support in patients with cardiogenic shock due to decompensated heart failure. This focused set of decisions entails calculations about the physiology that are normally performed in a physician’s head. We frame the decision problem as optimizing cardiovascular function to preserve oxygen delivery, and we apply tools from optimal control. Rather than hand-design a CCU controller we will use reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to “fit” one. The field of RL has experienced explosive growth over the past few years, with notable advances in strategic decision problems and robotics. A key challenge in the clinical environment is that the exploration phase of learning (“trial and error”) would be unethical in real patients. A second challenge is that the availability of patient data, while growing, is likely to be a bottleneck. We will leverage state-of-the-art model-based RL to train an algorithm using a combination of simulation and off-policy learning from historical data. We will use a model of cardiovascular physiology that underlies cardiac simulators in use today for the training of cardiologists. Historical patient data will come from the Massachusetts General Hospital Clinical Data Animation Center which has recorded real-time telemetry waveform data in addition to standard electronic medical record data from all CCU patients spanning several years. This is one of the largest and most complete datasets of its kind. The complexity of managing cardiogenic shock will continue to escalate as tools become more sophisticated and patients live longer, with more extensive comorbidities. Advanced decision support tools could help tame this complexity, improving the quality of care as well as democratizing it. Project Narrative The sickest cardiac patients are treated in the intensive care unit and are complex to manage. We aim to create a tool that will use artificial intelligence to study a patient's data and offer a physician advice.

"Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases PROJECT SUMMARY Although cardiac amyloidosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are relatively rare causes of heart failure (HF), they are particularly challenging to detect and treat for several shared reasons: (1) on routine clinical imaging (i.e., echocardiography [echo]), they can be difficult to distinguish from superficially similar, more common forms of cardiac disease that cause left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy; (2) the diagnoses are often missed and thus patients can present late in the course of disease at a time when treatment is difficult; (3) objective, noninvasive metrics that reliably reflect disease progression have not been identified; and (4) the small number of known patients with these diseases can make epidemiology studies and clinical trials difficult to organize and conduct. For both cardiac amyloidosis and HCM, echo plays a critical role in both diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring given its ubiquitous clinical availability, safety, and low cost. More broadly, echo dominates the current landscape of routine cardiac imaging, with tens of millions of echos performed in the United States each year. However, the clinical challenges described above highlight several shortcomings of echo: it is limited in its ability to (1) diagnose disease at its early stages; (2) discriminate between morphologically similar diseases; and (3) quantify disease progression. This proposal seeks to address deficiencies in the current echo reading workflow, which is subjective and captures only a small fraction of the data available in each study. The overall objective of this application is to use advances in machine learning to develop and validate fully-automated echo image analytic approaches to diagnose and track rare cardiomyopathies, focusing on cardiac amyloidosis and HCM. Our proposal is centered on the hypothesis that highly scalable computer vision methods can be applied to echo studies to overcome limitations of the standard clinical echo reading workflow. Accordingly our aims are: (1) Apply an automated method for echo quantification and disease identification to detect and differentiate cardiac diseases that cause increased LV wall thickness; and (2) Characterize quantifiable echo measures of disease progression in cardiac amyloidosis and HCM and associate these with clinical outcomes. Our multidisciplinary team, which is composed of experts in cardiomyopathies, echocardiography, computer vision, and machine learning, will analyze echos and patient data from 2 large patient registries: the Multicenter Amyloid Phenotyping Study (MAPS) and the Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (SHaRe) HCM Network, with validation using a repository of nearly 400,000 echos. The successful completion of our aims will result in an innovative tool for early diagnosis of myocardial diseases and tracking of disease progression. Importantly, our project will set the stage for conducting larger epidemiology studies of rare myocardial diseases by automating the identification of these patients, and thereby developing previously unattainable broad-based cohorts for these conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rare heart diseases such as amyloidosis (due to abnormal deposition of a protein into the heart muscle) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (due to a genetic mutation) are important causes of heart failure and sudden death in the general population. These heart diseases are difficult to diagnose, monitor, and treat because: (1) they appear superficially similar to more common forms of heart disease (e.g., high blood pressure) on imaging tests; (2) the optimal monitoring of disease progression over time has not been established; and (3) there is a lack of large-scale studies of patients with these diseases given their rarity. This project aims to use machine learning (artificial intelligence) of digital echocardiographic images to create a completely automated method for diagnosing and tracking these rare heart diseases with the ultimate goal of broad deployment of artificial intelligence algorithms in hospitals and clinics to help identify patients with these rare heart diseases earlier, better predict adverse outcomes, and increase the size and scope of patient registries to enhance research of these conditions.",Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases,10218258,R01HL140731,"['Affect ', ' Amyloid ', ' Amyloid Substance ', ' Amyloidosis ', ' amyloid disease ', ' Arrhythmia ', ' Cardiac Arrhythmia ', ' Heart Arrhythmias ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy ', ' Asymmetric Septal Hypertrophy ', ' Hereditary ventricular hypertrophy ', ' Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy ', ' Idiopathic Hypertrophic Subvalvular Stenosis ', ' Idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis ', ' hypertrophic myocardiopathy ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Sudden Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Echocardiography ', ' Echocardiogram ', ' Transthoracic Echocardiography ', ' heart sonography ', ' Two-Dimensional Echocardiography ', ' 2-D Echocardiography ', ' 2D Echocardiography ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Goals ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Myocardium ', ' cardiac muscle ', ' heart muscle ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' Reading ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Information Retrieval ', ' Information extraction ', ' Measures ', ' Left Ventricular Hypertrophy ', ' hypertensive heart disease ', ' hypertensive cardiomyopathy ', ' hypertensive heart disorder ', ' base ', ' career ', ' image processing ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Morphology ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Hereditary ', ' Inherited ', ' interest ', ' Clinics or Hospitals ', ' Clinics and Hospitals ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' cardiac imaging ', ' cardiac scanning ', ' heart scanning ', ' heart imaging ', ' particle ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' response ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Myocardial Diseases ', ' Myocardial Disorder ', ' Myocardiopathies ', ' myocardium disease ', ' myocardium disorder ', ' Cardiomyopathies ', ' patient registry ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' DNA mutation ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' genomic alteration ', ' DNA Sequence Alteration ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reader ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Ventricular ', ' Cardiac ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' clinical care ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' Algorithm Design ', ' Algorithmic Design ', ' Algorithmic Engineering ', ' algorithm engineering ', ' algorithmic composition ', ' clinical imaging ', ' automated image analysis ', ' statistical learning ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' ']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,646449,MA-07
"Using Large Electronic Health Records and Advanced Analytics to Develop Predictive Frailty Trajectories in Patients with Heart Failure Candidate objective: My objective for this award is to become an independent quantitative scientist in analytical clinical research through structured training and mentored research experience. My goal is to become an academic leader and developer of advanced predictive models of health trajectories using electronic health records (EHR). Training objectives: I seek to sharpen my skill set as a clinical quantitative scientist using clinical informatics, EHR data warehouses, and advanced computational models. I will use the protected time provided by this award to gain proficiency in patient-clinician interactions, clinical informatics, natural language processing, and advanced survival analysis to accomplish my research aims. Background: Frailty is a complex clinical syndrome associated with aging and chronic illness. It decreases physiological reserves and increases vulnerability to stressors. The prevalence of frailty in patients with heart failure is 74%. The interplay of frailty and heart failure increases the risk for death, prolonged hospital stays, and functional dependence. One conceptual framework to operationalize frailty is accumulation of deficits: the frailty index (FI). The FI provides a risk score based on the assumption that the more ailments a patient has, the higher the risk of adverse outcomes, including mortality. Prior FI models have not been used in routine clinical practice due to the following limitations: insufficient number and range of clinical variables, lack of personalized deficit detection, use of data not commonly found in EHRs, insufficient use of longitudinal analytical models including survival analysis techniques, and the reduction of FI to a cross-sectional health status rather than a health trajectory. Research Aim: The overarching goal of this application is to develop a frailty trajectory (FT) for heart failure patients that provides information integrating prior functional impairment, current functional status, and future risk of mortality. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel cross-sectional FI that uses the full breadth of outpatient EHR data and innovative machine learning data science methods to predict mortality. In Aim 2, we will use serial cross-sectional FIs to build FTs and identify clusters of individuals following a similar progression of frailty over time. In Aim 3, we will compare the prognostic value of cross-sectional FI versus FT. The VA national EHR offers the ideal context for this study, as it provides longitudinal data since 1999 and can link to administrative data from non- VA sources, including linked Medicare databases. Mentoring & environment: A multidisciplinary mentoring team will supervise my training and will oversee my mentored research projects, formal coursework, directed reading, and career development. The proposed activities will provide a foundation for transitioning to an independent quantitative data scientist developing clinical decision aids to guide patient care. Baylor College of Medicine and the Center for Innovations in Quality, Effectiveness, and Safety have a national reputation of mentoring and supporting junior faculty members from diverse academic backgrounds to independent careers as clinical-investigators. Physical frailty is common in adults with heart failure and increases the risk for poor health outcomes. Clinicians need tools to identify adults with physical frailty as part of routine care to support early intervention to treat frailty and reduce this risk. This application seeks to develop a novel measure of physical frailty using data collected as part of routine clinical care and recorded in the electronic health record.",Using Large Electronic Health Records and Advanced Analytics to Develop Predictive Frailty Trajectories in Patients with Heart Failure,10199037,K25HL152006,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Award ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Congestive Heart Failure ', ' Cardiac Failure Congestive ', ' Heart Decompensation ', ' chronic heart failure ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' indexing ', ' Laboratories ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' mortality ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Reading ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Supervision ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Frail Elderly ', ' Frail Elders ', ' Frail Older Adults ', ' Frail Seniors ', ' frail older adult ', ' Measures ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Decision Aid ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Guidelines ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Scientist ', ' frailty ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' functional status ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' International ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Older Population ', ' Text ', ' point of care ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' Medicare claim ', ' routine care ', ' clinical practice ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' screening ', ' signal processing ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' prognostic value ', ' prognostic ability ', ' prognostic power ', ' prognostic utility ', ' support tools ', ' Data Science ', ' clinical decision support ', ' individual variation ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variability ', ' data warehouse ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' random forest ', ' Data Scientist ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' advanced analytics ', ' ']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,K25,2021,143762,TX-09
"Extraction of molecular signature of HFpEF via a machine learning-empowered proteomic characterization: A study of the BCAA pathway PROJECT SUMMARY Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), characterized by heart failure symptoms with normal ejection fraction, is highly prevalent. However, most HFpEF patients do not respond to standard therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and there are no clear and uniform diagnostic criteria to stratify and differentiate HFpEF from HFrEF. Therefore, there is a pressing unmet need for us to better understand HFpEF at the molecular and system levels. Unbiased approaches such as machine learning (ML) offer a powerful means to tease out the molecular signatures of HFpEF in relevant disease models. The emerging evidence implicates that metabolism and redox homeostasis are two significant disruptions in cellular processes evidenced by clinical symptoms of HFpEF. Previous studies have identified branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolic defect as another major metabolic hallmark in heart failure as well as in metabolic disorders. Moreover, BCAA catabolic defects have been demonstrated to directly impact mitochondrial function and elevate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, resulting in oxidative stress-sensitive post-translational modifications (O-PTMs) that govern protein function and pathways. These exciting discoveries lead to our new hypothesis that O-PTM-mediated proteome remodeling is a dynamic and pervasive molecular change in diseased hearts, affecting proteins with central function in cardiac homeostasis and pathophysiology. To investigate the unique molecular features and pathogenic mechanisms of HFpEF, we highlight a novel HFpEF mouse model that incorporates both genetic predisposition for obesity/diabetes and pressure-overload, the two major risk factors for HFpEF, by performing trans-aortic constriction (TAC) in the ob/ob mice. We have also perfected the experimental tools and data analysis platform to provide O-PTM profiling at the whole-proteome level in hearts. Accordingly, we have strategically formulated the following aims according to three phenotypic levels: At the systemic level, Aim 1 will establish and characterize in vivo mouse models of HFpEF vs. HFrEF by cardiac and mitochondrial function as well as redox status. At the organellar level, Aim 2 will conduct targeted proteomics profiling of the cardiac mitochondria and extract O-PTM signatures using ML-based methods to achieve deep phenotyping of HFpEF and HFrEF. This information will then be integrated and enriched in an O- PTM molecular atlas and knowledge graph. At the molecular level, Aim 3 will target the BCAA catabolic pathway to exhaustively scrutinize its role in HFpEF and HFrEF. A multilevel understanding of the HFpEF phenotype, from its global profiling to molecular targets, will provide valuable new insights into the disease process that can lead to potential novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets. PROJECT NARRATIVE HFpEF is highly prevalent, yet there are few effective treatments or clear criteria to differentiate it from HFrEF. We propose to extract molecular signatures unique to HFpEF and HFrEF using a novel HFpEF mouse model and machine learning-based approaches. We anticipate that a multilevel understanding of the HFpEF phenotype, from its global profiling to molecular targets, will provide valuable new insights into the disease process that can lead to potential novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets.",Extraction of molecular signature of HFpEF via a machine learning-empowered proteomic characterization: A study of the BCAA pathway,10183311,R01HL146739,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Branched-Chain Amino Acids ', ' branched amino acids ', ' branched chain aminoacid ', ' Atlases ', ' Biology ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Heart ', ' Heart Atrium ', ' Atrial ', ' Cardiac Atrium ', ' atrium ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Obese Mice ', ' ob/ob mouse ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Myocardium ', ' cardiac muscle ', ' heart muscle ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Oxidation-Reduction ', ' Redox ', ' oxidation reduction reaction ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' pressure ', ' Production ', ' Post-Translational Protein Processing ', ' Post-Translational Modification Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Post-Translational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Protein Modification ', ' Posttranslational Modifications ', ' Posttranslational Protein Processing ', ' Protein Modification ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stress ', ' Mechanical Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Woman ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Mediating ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' therapy failure ', ' Reactive Oxygen Species ', ' Active Oxygen ', ' Oxygen Radicals ', ' Pro-Oxidants ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Failure ', ' heart function ', ' cardiac function ', ' function of the heart ', ' insight ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' genetic etiology ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' exhaustion ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Ejection Fraction ', ' EFRAC ', ' empowered ', ' Fatty Acid Metabolism Pathway ', ' fatty acid metabolism ', ' novel ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Catabolism ', ' Proteome ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Proteomics ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' Address ', ' Defect ', ' Symptoms ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' molecular profile ', ' molecular signature ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Molecular Target ', ' in vivo ', ' Pathologic ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' protein function ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Metabolic stress ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' therapeutic target ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' new drug target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new therapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' molecular phenotype ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' constriction ', ' antioxidant enzyme ', ' anti-oxidant enzyme ', ' Data Science ', ' preservation ', ' computational platform ', ' computing platform ', ' knowledge graph ', ' graph knowledge base ', ' graph knowledgebase ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,649707,CA-33
"Gadolinium Free Cardiac MR Imaging of Scar and Fibrosis Cardiovascular disease continues to be the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of scarred or fibrotic heart tissue plays a major diagnostic and prognostic role in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM). Cardiac MRI is a non-invasive, multifaceted imaging modality and is the clinical gold standard for scar and fibrotic cardiac tissue imaging with use of gadolinium-based contrast injection. However, administration of such gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA) prolongs the scan time, increases scan cost, and is contra-indicated in patients with impaired kidney function? a highly prevalent comorbidity in CHD patients. Until recently, GBCA was presumed to be safe in patients with normal kidney function; however, there are emerging data on long-term GBCA retention in the body. We aim to develop two complimentary approaches to reduce GBCA use in myocardial, or cardiac muscle, scar imaging. Initially, we will develop a quantitative risk-benefit model to identify NICM patients with a low chance of having scarred myocardium. Concurrently, we will develop a GBCA-free cardiac MR myocardial tissue probe platform based on AI (MyoProbe.ai) to quantify scarred regions of the heart. To accomplish this, we will develop and evaluate an individualized, patient-specific scar prediction model to reduce GBCA use in NICM patients with different etiologies by training the model to learn to identify whether the patient is likely to have scarring based on non-contrast images. If it is unlikely that a patient has scarring, contrast administration can be avoided. To develop and evaluate MyoProbe.ai for GBCA-free quantification of myocardial scar in CHD patients, we will use AI to integrate signal intensity and heart motion data from MRI images to accurately locate and quantify scar tissue. This information can then be used by cardiologists to diagnose and treat the patient. We will rigorously validate our risk-benefit model and AI myocardial probe platform using retrospectively and prospectively collected cardiac MRI images from multiple healthcare centers, MRI vendors, and magnetic field strengths. Our dataset will include different types of NICM and CHD patient populations to ensure that our work is applicable to patients with many different types of NICM and CHD. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of scarred/fibrotic heart tissue with gadolinium- based contrast agents (GBCA) plays a major diagnostic and prognostic role in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM). However, administration of GBCAs prolongs the scan time, increases scan cost, contaminates surface and drinking water, is retained in the body long-term, and is contra-indicated in patients with impaired renal function– a highly prevalent comorbidity in CHD patients.

"Cardiovascular MRI Characterization of the Arrhythmogenic Heart in Nonischemic Cardiomyopathy PROJECT SUMMARY Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Sudden cardiac death (SCD) associated with ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation (VT/VF) is responsible for 50% of deaths in patients with structural heart disease. The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is an established therapy for reducing arrhythmic mortality. Current guidelines for use of primary prevention ICD (i.e., patients without VT/VF history, but at risk) mainly emphasize left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). However, only a small percentage of ICD recipients actually receive appropriate ICD shocks, resulting in unnecessary costs and morbidity. While there is strong evidence that ICDs reduce mortality in patients with coronary artery disease, the benefit of primary prevention ICDs in patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) is less robust. Furthermore, SCD mostly occurs in patients with moderate systolic dysfunction who are currently not eligible for an ICD, further highlighting the limitations of LVEF to choose appropriate ICD candidates. Given the limitations of LVEF, there is a pressing need for better risk stratification strategies to identify which NICM patients are most likely to benefit from ICD therapy. Our three specific aims seek to 1) identify the biological basis of cardiac MR (CMR) radiomic phenotyping of the myocardium by investigating the association between endocardial/epicardial electrograms (EGM) and CMR radiomic markers; 2) investigate CMR imaging markers that can identify patients with mild to moderate systolic dysfunction (LVEF of 36% to 50%) at risk of ventricular arrhythmia, who are likely to benefit from prophylactic ICD therapy and ultimately reduce total SCD burden; and 3) identify NICM patients with LVEF 35% undergoing primary prevention ICD implantation who are less likely to benefit from ICD by developing a novel risk prediction model integrating CMR markers. Precise identification of individuals who are at risk of SCD will (a) reduce mortality by offering ICD therapy to patients with mild to moderate systolic dysfunction who are currently not eligible, and (b) reduce morbidity and healthcare costs in ICD-eligible patients who are at low risk of SCD and unlikely to obtain a worthwhile benefit. Project Narrative Sudden cardiac death (SCD) associated with ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation is responsible for 50% of deaths in patients with structural heart disease. The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is an established therapy for reducing arrhythmic mortality.

"Wake Forest Atrium HeartShare Clinical Center Project Summary Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) is the most common form of HF in the US and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. However, its pathophysiology is incompletely understood, and most trials have been neutral such that few evidence-based treatments exist. In response, NIH convened 2 workshops co-led by Dr. Kitzman (PI). The highest priority research recommendation was a coordinated effort to create a large cohort of HFpEF patients and controls and perform comprehensive, deep phenotyping. This became the basis for HeartShare, whose ultimate goals are to discover novel HFpEF mechanisms, subtypes, and therapeutic targets. Our Wake Forest - Atrium HFpEF team is highly qualified to serve as a Clinical Center and make robust, over-arching contributions to HeartShare. Dr. Kitzman is internationally recognized as a thought-leader in HFpEF with a sustained track record of developing novel concepts regarding HFpEF pathogenesis, mechanisms, and outcomes and designing and conducting innovative studies to test them. His team has extensive experience in all key aspects of the HeartShare program, particularly in recruiting, retaining, and phenotyping diverse populations of HFpEF patients and controls, often significantly exceeding goals for racial and gender diversity. Our institutions have ~15,000 HFpEF clinical visits annually. In all, our team has led or helped lead recruitment and phenotyping for 69 studies, mostly NIH-sponsored, with 15,354 participants, demonstrating our ability to fulfill HeartShare recruitment and phenotyping goals. Data from these studies will be contributed to the Cohort phase of HeartShare. We will make robust contributions to HeartShare by achieving 4 Specific Aims: Aim 1) Provide ‘thought leadership’ in collaboration with the HeartShare Steering Committee; Aim 2) Contribute data, images, and stored specimens cohort phase of HeartShare from our numerous studies of HFpEF and controls, and identify and phenotype HFpEF patients and controls from the electronic health record using robust bioinformatics tools; Aim 3) Recruit, consent, enroll and follow at least 250 HFpEF patients plus controls (type and number to be determined by consensus); Aim 4) Conduct state-of- the-art deep phenotyping exams using a collaboratively determined protocol. Our phenotyping proposal is highly innovative, with advanced echo-Doppler and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, CPET, physical activity monitoring, remote and artificial intelligence electrocardiography, sampling of skeletal muscle, adipose, blood, and microbiome, and mitochondrial energetics, and brain structure/function. Our diverse, cross- disciplinary team has the full range of complementary expertise and access to the robust resources of two large, closely affiliated health systems to ensure fulfillment of all HeartShare’s goals. We will help accelerate and optimize the program’s success with our insight, creativity, and sustained track record of collaboration, innovation, and dissemination. Project Narrative Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is common, its mechanisms are not well understood, and there are few proven treatments; this problem will be addressed by HeartShare. Our Wake Forest Atrium HeartShare Clinical Center will contribute thought leadership and data from our existing cohorts and trials, and deeply phenotype 250 HFpEF patients plus control participants according to a comprehensive state-of-the art protocol designed to understand cardiac, vascular, and extra-cardiac factors contributing to HFpEF.",Wake Forest Atrium HeartShare Clinical Center,10327453,U01HL160272,"['Abdomen ', ' Abdominal ', ' Adipose tissue ', ' Fatty Tissue ', ' adipose ', ' white adipose tissue ', ' yellow adipose tissue ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Aorta ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biopsy ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Body Composition ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cognition ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Control Groups ', ' Creativeness ', ' creativity ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' ECG ', ' EKG ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heart ', ' Heart Atrium ', ' Atrial ', ' Cardiac Atrium ', ' atrium ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Morbidity -

"Cloud-based High-throughput Acquisition and Analytics of Zebrafish Electrocardiogram for Cardiac Studies and Drug Development Project Summary Sensoriis, Inc is a company that, develops evidence-based sensing solutions to support biological investigations and address health care problems. The goal of this NIH SBIR Phase II grant with University of California Irvine is to provide novel systems to assess cardiac electrophysiology in zebrafish models, supporting heart disease studies and drug screening. Heart disease plagues the world as the leading cause of mortality. Cardiac arrhythmic diseases alone contributed about 350,000 deaths annually in the U.S. Although causative genes for some of them have been partially discovered, genetic basis for the majority remains poorly understood. The zebrafish (Dario rerio) model system is an important vertebrate experimental model owing to its small size, low-cost for maintenance, short generation time, amenable and conserved genetics, and optical transparency. Zebrafish have long been used as model system for understanding human cardiac development, disease, and regeneration. Further, zebrafish model enables a forward genetic approach to reveal the genetic basis and underlying molecular mechanisms of numerous heart diseases. Owing to the physiological similarities to humans’, zebrafish have also proven to be an ideal model system for drug screening. The conventional setup for cardiac phenotype acquisition in zebrafish (i.e. electrocardiogram – ECG) involves anesthesia causing variation in functionality. To date, there is no system which can offer cardiac phenotype monitoring in freely-swimming zebrafish, not to mention for multiple fish simultaneously. Further, data processing and analysis have been done manually, making it impossible to conduct large-scale studies. In this context, we propose to establish a long-term roadmap using multidisciplinary approaches to enable i) novel devices and systems to provide reliable ECG data of multiple fish (both adult fish and larvae) over a long period of time; ii) cloud-based systems to effectively process and interpret as well as study large-scale data; and iii) a host of cardiac studies as well as drug investigations using the zebrafish models and our novel tools. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this Phase II SBIR grant, Sensoriis, Inc and the University of California Irvine will develop novel bioengineering tools to collect and study electrocardiogram of the zebrafish model with high throughput. The goal is to facilitate and reduce cost and time of cardiac phenotype-based acquisition and analytics in the zebrafish models, supporting numerous cardiac studies and drug screening applications.

"Evaluating and Improving Utilization of Evidence-Based Medical Therapy in Patients with Heart Failure using Automated Tools in the Electronic Health Record PROJECT SUMMARY Heart failure (HF) affects over 6 million US adults, with high rates of hospitalization and nearly 50% mortality at 5 years from diagnosis. Nearly half of these patients have systolic HF with multiple evidence-based therapeutic options proven to reduce the risk of hospitalization and mortality in this subgroup of patients. Evaluating the appropriate utilization of these therapies is currently limited to post-hoc assessments of manually abstracted patient records at a limited number of hospitals participating in quality improvement registries. These manual abstraction strategies do not offer opportunities to improve care in real-time, and even at hospitals engaged in quality improvement efforts, only 1 in 5 of eligible patients with HF receive all first-line evidence based medical treatments. In this patient-oriented mentored career development award proposal, Dr. Rohan Khera proposes to leverage the ubiquitous digitization of medical records in the electronic health record (EHR) to address the adequate utilization of evidence based medical therapy in HF. He proposes to use a large, publicly accessible, deidentified EHR database to develop and validate an algorithm that uses deep learning based natural language processing (NLP) within unstructured clinical documentation for hospitalized HF patients to identify those with systolic HF (Aim #1). He will engage clinicians to design consensus-based algorithms to identify contraindications to HF treatments, developed as algorithms within the EHR (Aim #2). Finally, he will construct a prototypic clinical decision support (CDS) tool identifying HF treatment eligibility in real-time using the algorithms and evaluate potential implementation strategies using qualitative evaluation of feedback from clinicians and patients (Aim #3). While proposed as a strategy to evaluate quality of care of individual patients, the proposed research will also model a fully automated electronic clinical quality measure for HF. The algorithms will be made open source to allow institutions to validate and apply them to their individual care setting. The proposal is supported by strong mentorship from experts in quality measure design, informatics, advanced NLP, CDS design, and qualitative research methodology. The facilities at Yale Center of Outcomes Research and Evaluation, which designs and evaluates national quality measures, and has access to computational resources required to accomplish the research goals as well as to the Yale EHR to validate the models are major strengths of the application. The proposed period of mentored research will support Dr. Khera’s training in medical informatics, advanced analytic tools such as NLP, and qualitative research methodology. The experience and skillset acquired during this period will support Dr. Khera’s transition to independence where he plans to lead multi-institutional collaboratives to evaluate the use of automated tools in the measurement and improvement of the quality of medical care in HF. The career development plan that accompanies the proposal is designed to support Dr. Khera’s long-term career goal to be a national leader in the design and implementation of informatics- based approaches of delivering high quality, patient-centered, cardiovascular care. PROJECT NARRATIVE The scope of quality improvement programs that focus on improving the utilization of first-line evidence-based medical therapies in patients with heart failure is limited by mechanisms to identify those who are eligible for specific treatments. The current proposal aims to design automated tools to identify patients eligible for heart failure therapies using various data components already captured in the electronic health record in hospitalized patients. The proposal will then pilot test strategies of improving treatment utilization with electronic alerts delivered to clinicians based on these tools.",Evaluating and Improving Utilization of

"Cardiac MR-Based Risk Stratification for Heart Failure and Atrial Fibrillation in HCM Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common genetic heart disease, affecting as many as 1:200 individuals in the general population. HCM, initially described in the context of sudden cardiac death (SCD), is commonly associated with heart failure (HF) and atrial fibrillation (AF). Rigorous research over the past two decades has enabled us to identify HCM patients at the greatest risk of SCD who could benefit from a prophylactic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). With advances in SCD prevention, HCM management has now shifted its focus to HF and AF. Nearly 50% of HCM patients have mild to severe HF symptoms. HF is now considered the most common cause of HCM-related mortality. AF is the most common sustained arrhythmia, occurring in nearly 25% of HCM patients, and responsible for a decreased quality of life and increased stroke risk. Currently, we are not able to predict which HCM patients are more likely to progress toward end-stage HF or develop AF. Cardiovascular imaging using echocardiography and cardiac MR has played a central role in our evolving understanding of HCM. Echocardiography provides a robust assessment of left ventricular (LV) outflow obstruction and diastolic dysfunction. With its high spatial resolution and remarkable tissue characterization capabilities, cardiac MR has emerged as an imaging modality well suited to characterize the HCM phenotype. The goal of this proposal is to develop novel risk stratification paradigms by leveraging recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) to improve HCM patient management. We will investigate a deep learning (DL) risk model for prediction of adverse cardiovascular outcomes that incorporates (a) standard clinical and imaging parameters and (b) novel cardiac MR signatures extracted using (i) radiomic analysis (i.e. a computational method to automatically extract and select clinically significant imaging markers) or (ii) deep imaging signatures, extracted using deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). The performance of these models will be rigorously evaluated using 3 HCM cohorts collected at Tufts Medical Center, BIDMC, and University of Toronto.

"Machine Learning and Deformable Model-based 4D Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony from MRI Summary/Abstract In the presence of diseases such as ischemic heart disease (IHD), cardiac dyssynchrony deteriorates cardiac function and often cannot be treated effectively. However, while imaging methods such as cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) can provide high quality images of the moving heart, conventional clinical quantitative analysis of cardiac function is largely limited to global function analysis of the left ventricle (LV), with only qualitative and subjective characterization of regional function. An obstacle to better quantification of regional function is the complex 3D structure and motion of the heart wall, which has typically necessitated time-consuming user-guided processing of the images to carry out the associated 3D-motion analysis.  Recent advances in machine-learning (ML) approaches for image analysis are promising as new means to speed up the processing of cardiac images, as well as to analyze the underlying regional motion patterns. However, current Deep ML (DML) approaches to image analysis largely function as “black boxes”, without clear indications of which features contribute most to the analysis results, thus limiting their clinical utility. In the initial funded period of this research project, we have been developing integrated approaches to the segmentation, 3D reconstruction, and analysis of CMR data, with application to the evaluation of cardiac dyssynchrony. Today, treatment of dyssynchrony in HF with cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) leads to improvement in only ~2/3 patients selected with conventional criteria (usually by electrocardiogram [ECG]). Our initial results show encouraging results of correlation between MRI evaluation of dyssynchrony and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) outcomes. In the new proposed research, we will further develop these methods, with the goal of automating the cardiac analysis methods. This will include the introduction of new ML-based methods, which will incorporate information on the specific cardiac motion factors that lead to classification of different disease states in dyssynchrony. Our Hypothesis is that by using these new ML-based methods for cardiac motion analysis, we will discover and evaluate significant quantitative correlations between different cardiac dyssynchrony motion patterns and CRT outcomes. Also, late-gadolinium enhancement (LGE) provides images for infarction visualization. Incorporation of tissue characterization into the motion-pattern analysis could lead to increased understanding of how infarcted areas affect regional motion in concert with dyssynchrony. The unearthing of these findings will allow us to validate them in future clinical studies. The project will also disseminate our novel, coupled DML and model-based methodology for quantifying and classifying cardiac motion in diseases affecting regional wall motion. Other research groups can then apply our tools to specifically study dyssynchrony, as well as other cardiac diseases affecting LV motion. Project Narrative A significant proportion of patients with heart failure and cardiac dyssynchrony fail to positively respond to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), as the current clinical selection criteria do not take into account regional cardiac function. We will develop improved methods for 4D-analysis and -visualization of both global and regional cardiac function from cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) data, including novel deep learning methods that will provide additional information on the salient features that contribute most to characterization of cardiac dyssynchrony. These new methods will be applied to the analysis of CMR data from both a stratified sample of normal subjects and patients with cardiac dyssynchrony (with and without infarction), with correlation with therapeutic results following CRT, potentially leading to improved clinical guidelines and clinical outcomes, as well as increased understanding of cardiac physiology and pathophysiology.",Machine Learning and Deformable Model-based 4D Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony from MRI,10234187,R01HL127661,"['Affect ', ' Attention ', ' Automation ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cardiovascular Physiology ', ' cardiovascular function ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Echocardiography ', ' Echocardiogram ', ' Transthoracic Echocardiography ', ' heart sonography ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' ECG ', ' EKG ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' Future ', ' Gadolinium ', ' Gd element ', ' Goals ', ' Heart ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Image Enhancement ', ' Infarction ', ' infarct ', ' Ischemia ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Motion ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Research ', ' Sweden ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Schedule ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Myocardial Ischemia ', ' Ischemic Heart ', ' Ischemic Heart Disease ', ' Ischemic myocardium ', ' cardiac ischemia ', ' coronary ischemia ', ' heart ischemia ', ' myocardial ischemia/hypoxia ', ' myocardium ischemia ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' Pump ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Left ventricular structure ', ' Left Ventricles ', ' heart function ', ' cardiac function ', ' function of the heart ', ' Selection Criteria ', ' Patient Selection ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' QRS Complex ', ' EKG QRS Complex ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Location ', ' Width ', ' cardiac motion ', ' heart motion ', ' cardiac imaging ', ' cardiac scanning ', ' heart scanning ', ' heart imaging ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Magnetic Resonance ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' therapy outcome ', ' therapeutic outcome ', ' Cardiac ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' reconstruction ', ' Outcome ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' 3-D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3D structure ', ' Consumption ', ' Coupled ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' cardiac resynchronization therapy ', ' improved outcome ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' imaging approach ', ' imaging based approach ', ' deep learning ', ' Visualization ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NHLBI,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2021,735785,NJ-06
"A multifaceted adaptive mobile application to promote self-management and improve outcomes in heart failure PROJECT SUMMARY Heart failure (HF) is the most common hospital discharge diagnosis among older adults in the United States. Strikingly, 2 in 5 patients are readmitted within 1-year following their first HF admission. This results in significant potentially avoidable costs to our already strained healthcare system, since hospitalizations result in 70% of yearly HF management costs. The most common causes of readmission are failure to recognize clinical worsening and dietary nonadherence. As a result, HF management is rapidly evolving from the traditional model of face-to-face follow-up visits toward a proactive real-time technological model of assisting patients with monitoring and self-management while in the community. While several HF studies have implemented technologically-driven disease management programs, results have been mixed. These systems effectively deliver monitoring data and alerts to healthcare providers. However, their effectiveness in delivering behavioral interventions to patients and modifying patient behavior, a crucial factor in HF self-management, is unknown. Therefore, it is imperative to develop and test patient- centered technologies that deliver behavioral interventions to promote self-management for the most common causes of readmissions with an overall goal of reducing HF readmissions. This proposed project will determine the effectiveness of two interventions within a mobile application and builds on our work from previous research. Our central hypothesis is that a patient-centered mobile application with contextual just-in-time interventions about self-management during a clinical worsening and dietary sodium will improve the health status of HF patients. The rationale for this project, which is supported by our preliminary data, is that a new model for disease management - placing patients in control of their condition - will have a substantial positive impact on HF outcomes. Our objectives are to: (1) determine the impact of two unique adaptive mobile application interventions on HF readmission and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in HF patients, (2) establish the effect the interventions have on proximal outcomes and that the proximal outcomes mediate the intervention’s impact on HF readmission and HRQOL, and (3) develop data-driven machine learning models that can predict episodes of clinical worsening.

"System-independent quantitative cardiac  CT perfusion System-independent quantitative cardiac CT perfusion Phase II, SBIR Summary BioInVision, Inc. and team - Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) biomedical engineers and University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center (UH) imaging cardiologists - will develop software for quantitative analysis of cardiac CT perfusion (CCTP) data, creating an important tool for evaluation of cardiovascular disease. With this product, cardiologists will be able to identify functional flow deficits in coronary artery territories. When one combines functional myocardial blood flow (MBF) function with coronary anatomy from coronary computed to- mography angiography (CCTA), it provides needed information on the physiologic significance of a stenosis. The CCTP+CCTA combination could provide an ideal gateway exam for deciding whether to send a patient for percutaneous invasive coronary angiography and potential intervention (e.g., stenting). In addition, low flow with- out the presence of a stenosis suggests microvascular disease, a very prevalent ailment of growing concern, especially among women and diabetes patients. CT compares favorably to all other non-invasive cardiovascular imaging techniques (SPECT, PET, and MRI). It is available in many settings, including emergency departments, and is high throughput as compared to other methods. It provides both MBF and reliable coronary anatomy, with are unavailable in any other single modality, providing a unique ability to non-invasively discriminate cardiac microvascular disease. It has excellent resolution enabling detection of endocardial perfusion deficit, thought to be an early disease indicator that is impossible to assess with SPECT. CT is cheaper and has higher patient throughput than MRI or PET. With the inclusion of MBF, CT would have an excellent opportunity to disrupt the diagnostic pathway leading to percutaneous intervention, a pathway which has been dominated by SPECT my- ocardial imaging, a modality that gives zero information about coronary anatomy. To achieve reliable, accurate CT MBF measurements, we will invoke innovations to reduce beam hardening and to make reliable flow esti- mates. Currently, CT perfusion is done on different CT machines with manufacturers’ proprietary software, using algorithms that can give erroneous MBFs. Applicable to any commercial scanner; our solution would harmonize measurements across acquisition systems providing trustworthy, standardized measurements to clinicians, thereby improving management of cardiovascular patients. Narrative We will develop software to enable reliable evaluation of blood flow in heart tissue using CT imaging. With suc- cess, our project could lead to an improved gateway examination that could reduce unnecessary invasive coro- nary angiography, thereby reducing costs, patient discomfort, patient risk, and possibly unnecessary interven- tional therapies.",System-independent quantitative cardiac  CT perfusion,10154267,R44HL156811,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ',

"PREcision Care In Cardiac ArrEst - ICECAP (PRECICECAP) Project Summary: The goals of the parent PREcision Care In Cardiac ArrEst - ICECAP (PRECICECAP) study are to discover novel biomarker signatures after cardiac arrest that predict treatment responsiveness and long-term recovery. Cardiac arrest is a major public health problem with high morbidity and mortality. Improving survival and functional recovery are critical public health objectives. We hypothesize that not all patients are identical and that through innovative, multi-parametric data- driven approaches we will be able to identify novel signatures to identify distinct patient subgroups. The PRECICECAP analysis plan allows us to meet our study needs but is not intrinsically generalizable or usable by others. An ever-growing number of NIH-funded projects amass and analyze related datasets from hospitalized patients and develop their own custom solutions. Such an ad hoc approach is costly, inefficient, and threatens research rigor and reproducibility. The objective of this supplement to PRECICECAP is to develop a freely-available software platform that allows artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) analysis of complex neurocritical care data and to provide a curated dataset from PRECICECAP ready for AI/ML. The knowledge learned here will be applied to help achieve NIH goals for modernizing the biomedical research data ecosystem by developing a software product that can handle AI/ML on this type of complex neurocritical care data. It will also allow the sharing of a cleaned, annotated comprehensive data set. Through a thoughtful collaboration between clinician investigators, data scientists and industry, we will take NIH-supported data from the PRECICECAP study and make it broadly available and easily usable. The project will deliver an important software tool that can be used by others conducting similar research, advancing the NIH’s mission to make complex data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable). We will develop a series of modular functions (for example, to support data harmonization, annotation or visualization) that permit users to graphically construct processing pipelines maximizing automation where appropriate and allowing facile interaction with data when needed. We will develop a user-friendly dashboard interface to allow individual study sites and coordinating hubs to understand complex data, inspect key meta-data features, and identify potential errors. Modular design facilitates dynamic configuration of AI/ML architectures within the same interface, allowing individual modules to combine synergistically to maximize efficiency and reproducibility. The result will facilitate an open, wide collaboration between scientists using similar data. Project Narrative: Patients with severe acute brain injury require intensive care where the brain, heart, lungs, and other organs are continuously monitored to guide treatments to reduce death and disability. The data generated from this monitoring are complex and information rich. This project will develop rigorous, freely available software tools to facilitate reproducible curation of AI/ML- ready data and a large ready-to-analyze dataset from patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest, which together will have a major impact on public health by advancing efforts towards data-driven precision medicine.",PREcision Care In Cardiac ArrEst - ICECAP (PRECICECAP),10412861,R01NS119825,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Attention ', ' Automation ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation ', ' cardiac resuscitation ', ' heart resuscitation ', ' Communities ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Data Aggregation ', ' Aggregated Data ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Goals ', ' Heart ', ' Heart Arrest ', ' Asystole ', ' Cardiac Arrest ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' natural hypothermia ', ' Hypothermia ', ' Industry ', ' Libraries ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Manuals ', ' Mission ', ' Modernization ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Terminology ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Intensive Care ', ' Acute Brain Injuries ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' quality assurance ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Series ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Modern Medicine ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Cardiopulmonary ', ' functional recovery ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' novel ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Ontology ', ' Monitor ', ' Common Data Element ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' user-friendly ', ' graphical user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' software user interface ', ' novel marker ', ' new marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' personalized care ', ' Precision care ', ' individualized care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' data visualization ', ' application programming interface ', ' application program interface ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' data archive ', ' data library ', ' dashboard ', ' FAIR principles ', ' FAIR data ', ' FAIR guiding principles ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable ', ' EEG-based imaging ', ' EEG based imaging ', ' EEG imaging ', ' electroencephalographic based imaging ', ' electroencephalography based imaging ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' Data Scientist ', ' data pipeline ', ' Visualization ', ' data ecosystem ', ' data sharing ecosystem ', ' feature extraction ', ' complex data ', ' data harmonization ', ' harmonized data ', ' biomarker signature ', ' ']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,329031,CA-18
"Elucidating Genotype-Phenotype Relationship of Polygenic Dilated Cardiomyopathies PROJECT SUMMARY Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a genetic cardiac disorder with high morbidity and an incidence of 1:250. Although generally thought of as a disease with monogenic heritability, recent genetic studies suggest complex polygenic causes. Functional profiles of polygenic cardiomyopathies are poorly understood and this hampers effective therapeutics development. Recent advances in stem cell technology such as patient- derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and genome-editing, provides an unprecedented opportunity to study such disease phenotypes. Cardiomyocytes will be differentiated from iPSCs taken from patients with two DCM related mutations and sequenced to understand transcriptome differences that may correlate with disease susceptibility. The analysis will be normalized by using CRISPR to create isogenic controls and also insert the mutations in healthy individuals that are related to these patients. We will then utilize the iPSC platform coupled with tissue engineering to develop engineered heart tissues composed of cardiac specific cells. We will perform single cell RNA sequencing to test the cell-cell interactions and crosstalk between the cells. We will also perform functional assays like calcium-handling and contractility. CRISPR/dCas9 systems will allow us to identify genes suitable for drug targeting. The overarching goal of the parent R01 grant is to understand underlying mechanisms of polygenic DCM using the iPSC platform. The proposed diversity supplement extends this work by studying patients of different ethnicities and considering how this factors in disease severity. African-American and Hispanic patients are underrepresented in health studies, and therefore more vulnerable to poor disease management. Dr. Carlos Vera will expand our cohort of 20 individuals by six iPSC lines derived from these minority populations and perform the proposed set of experiments. PROJECT NARRATIVE Polygenic dilated cardiomyopathy is an inherited form of cardiac disease where multiple genes relating to muscle function carry mutations that lead to reduced function. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) derived from patients and differentiated to cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CM) are an indispensable new tool to study pathological signatures when coupled to genomics, cellular biology, and tissue engineering. Through the parent grant and this diversity supplement, we aim to study the pathology manifested in different patients, including ones typically underrepresented in genetic studies like African Americans and Latinos and consider how much ethnicity plays a role in severity.",Elucidating Genotype-Phenotype Relationship of Polygenic Dilated Cardiomyopathies,10359919,R01HL130020,"['Appointment

"Association of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder with Cardiac Electrical Instability: A Twin Study ABSTRACT Psychological stress is a potentially major risk factor for sudden cardiac death (SCD), but unfortunately not studied very well. This may in part be is due to the fact that many SCDs are unwitnessed, which makes the study of SCD triggers difficult. As a possible solution to this problem, we propose to study electrocardiographic (ECG) markers of cardiac electrical instability in a cohort of 1,000 Veteran male twins who are recruited from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry. Dr. Shah is an Early Stage Investigator who is poised to lead this effort that follows from his previous work on arrhythmia risk due to acute mental stress (K23 HL127251). His team includes several established investigators in the field of PTSD and heart disease (Viola Vaccarino, Douglas Bremner), stress and arrhythmia (Rachel Lampert), and signal processing/mobile health technologies (Gari Clifford, Larry Jamner). Dr. Shah, over the past several years, has worked closely with the Vietnam veteran twins and is an experienced investigator with this cohort. They have generated important preliminary data that demonstrates a potential relationship between PTSD and TWA; in addition, they have demonstrated feasibility of studying Veterans continuously for one week in their currently funded study which measures PTSD, autonomic function, and sleep. Dr. Shah is also leading telehealth efforts at the Atlanta Veterans Affairs Medical Center, which has provided important methodologies for the current study to recruit and enroll participants from around the United States remotely. The first aim seeks to evaluate the relationship of PTSD symptoms and cardiac electrical instability using two ECG-based markers for arrhythmia: microvolt T-wave alternans (TWA) and morphological beat variability (MVB). Both are expected to be associated with higher PTSD symptoms, suggesting an acutely increased risk of sudden cardiac death. The relationship is also hypothesized to be moderated by genetic factors: when adjusting for genetic factors by evaluating monozygotic twin pairs discordant for PTSD, the relationship is attenuated. Aim 2 examines the relationship between everyday PTSD symptoms with an ecological momentary assessment and MVB/TWA. We hypothesize that acute increases in PTSD symptoms and stress also increase cardiac electrical instability, measured by higher TWA and MVB. Finally, aim 3 explores fragmented sleep and other behavioral correlates of PTSD as possible mechanisms through which PTSD may indirectly impact SCD risk through modifiable behaviors. Our hypothesis is that sleep fragmentation and other maladaptive behaviors such as low physical activity will result higher TWA/MVB on a daily basis. Overall, Dr. Shah is a poised and well-equipped to carry out this large project with novel methods and unprecedented reach in terms of impact and  Project Narrative Psychological stress is a potentially major risk factor for sudden cardiac death and can cause cardiac electrical instability. This study aims to address the reasons behind sudden cardiac death by evaluating the relationship of cardiac electrical instability with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We will also study the way in which PTSD-related genes, sleep disturbance, and physical inactivity may also play a role in its potential relationship with cardiac electrical risk.",Association of

"Novel Cardiac MRI-Based Predictors for Tetralogy of Fallot: Deformation, Kinematic, and Geometric Analyses Five to 10% of patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot (rTOF) die before age 30, but our ability to predict which patients will experience death, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation (DVTF) is limited. The optimal timing of pulmonary valve replacement (PVR), which may delay DVTF, is also not clear. The current best predictors of DVTF and guidance for PVR timing rely on “traditional” measures such as right ventricular volume and ejection fraction, which are derived from cardiac MRI (CMR). However, even the best DVTF models have limited predictive power, and these “traditional” volumetric measures fail to predict appropriate response to PVR for 30-40% of patients. This proposal aims to address the critical need for CMR based- metrics that correlate with DVTF and predict response to PVR better than traditional ventricular volumetrics. This will be accomplished through the development of ventricular deformation-, kinematic-, and geometry- based mechanics metrics for rTOF patients from routinely acquired, standard of care CMR datasets, which would allow rapid implementation in clinical practice. The critical need will be addressed through two Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1: Develop and evaluate novel CMR-based predictors of clinical outcomes in patients with rTOF. Specific Aim 2: Prospectively assess ventricular geometry-based predictors of response to pulmonary valve replacement in rTOF patients. The rationale is that if computational modeling techniques can generate metrics that outperform traditional markers, they can be used to change current patient management with the eventual goal to delay DVTF. The failure to develop improved metrics will lead to continued excess mortality and suboptimal clinical outcomes for patients with rTOF. The combination of cross-sectional and longitudinal approaches allows a more comprehensive assessment of CMR metrics in a population where randomized controlled trials are not feasible. This work has the potential for rapid implementation and thus to mark a paradigm shift in the use of computational modeling in clinical cardiology. The candidate’s career goal is to be an independent investigator leading multidisciplinary research teams to develop new, more accurate, and easily applied outcome predictors for congenital heart disease (CHD). This would place him at the nexus of clinical pediatric cardiology, biomedical engineering, and computer science. To achieve this goal, he will learn about machine learning and kinematic analyses, their strengths and pitfalls, and the data characteristics needed for these analyses. He will learn how to bring his findings to clinical practice and design studies using the newly developed metrics. He will then design R01-funded research to prospectively assess the performance of the ventricular mechanical metrics to guide PVR and predict DVTF. This will all be accomplished through a dedicated, multi-disciplinary mentor/advisor team, a supportive academic environment, and didactic and hands-on training. At the completion of this training, the applicant plans to be a world leader in the application of advanced imaging analytics for congenital heart disease. Project Narrative  The proposed research is relevant to public health because patients with tetralogy of Fallot, the most common cyanotic congenital heart disease affecting ~1:2500 babies, have increased risk of heart failure and premature death despite excellent initial surgery. Development of non-invasive, easily obtained, and rapidly implemented metrics of ventricular mechanics are needed to improve prediction of death and allow optimization of pulmonary valve replacement timing. This project is relevant to the NHLBI’s mission because the tools developed here, and the skills learned, could then be applied to other forms of congenital and structural heart disease, and promote longer and more fulfilling lives for patients.","Novel Cardiac MRI-Based Predictors for Tetralogy of Fallot: Deformation, Kinematic, and Geometric Analyses",10127094,K23HL150279,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Arrhythmia ', ' Cardiac Arrhythmia ', ' Heart Arrhythmias ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bio-engineered ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bioengineering ', ' Cardiology ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Environment ', ' Goals ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Mentors ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity -

"Deep Learning Assessment of the Right Ventricle: Function, Etiology, and Prognosis ABSTRACT Heart failure imposes a tremendous burden of morbidity and mortality, costing the United States in excess of $31 billion annually. An increasingly recognized major determinant of outcomes in heart failure is right ventricular (RV) dysfunction. However, the nature and character of RV contribution to cardiovascular outcomes remains poorly understood, largely due to the imprecision of imaging and interpretation of RV morphology and function. Echocardiography, with its high temporal resolution and low cost of acquisition, serves as frontline cardiovascular imaging and a mainstay in approaches to assessing RV morphology and function. However, echocardiographic imaging of the RV is limited by factors that include technical variation in image acquisition and heterogeneity in image assessment as well as overall interpretation. We postulate that deep learning based phenotyping can offer the ability to not only more precisely characterize RV function but also classify RV imaging phenotypes according to etiologic disease states and, even further, refine prognostic evaluations of future cardiovascular risk. Therefore, in Aim 1, we will use video-based deep learning segmentation models to assess RV function, evaluate its cross-sectional relation with a range of expert-measured parameters, and examine its variation in the context of patient characteristics derived from large hospital-based cohorts. In Aim 2, we will use video-based deep learning models to produce imaging-based classification of RV disease and assess the ability of unsupervised approaches to classify RV dysfunction into various categories of disease etiology. In Aim 3, we will use models developed in part from training in Aims 1 and 2 to predict major cardiovascular outcomes including heart failure in addition to coronary artery disease, stroke, and cardiovascular death in both hospital- based and community-based cohorts. The overarching goal of this proposal is to improve the precision and standardization of RV phenotyping and determine the extent to which deep learning models can augment human assessment of the RV. This research will be accomplished in the setting of a comprehensive career development program designed to provide the candidate with the skills needed to become an independent physician-scientist in cardiovascular medicine and translational imaging science. An advisory committee of established scientists/mentors in the fields of cardiac imaging, deep learning, data science, and translational science will guide the candidate in his transition to scientific independence over the course of the award period. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT Heart failure imposes a tremendous morbidity and mortality burden, costing the U.S. healthcare system over $31 billion per year. An under-recognized and yet important contributor to heart failure outcomes is right ventricular dysfunction, which remains understudied due to technical issues that have historically challenged conventional approaches to cardiovascular imaging. We will examine how deep learning models can precisely evaluate right ventricular function – and enable earlier, more accurate assessments of its contributions to cardiovascular risk.","Deep Learning Assessment of the Right Ventricle: Function, Etiology, and Prognosis",10185865,K99HL157421,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Award ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dissection ', ' Echocardiography ', ' Echocardiogram ', ' Transthoracic Echocardiography ', ' heart sonography ', ' Engineering ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Learning ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motion ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Program Development ', ' Pulmonary Embolism ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Semantics ', ' Standardization ', ' statistics ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Right Ventricular Function ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Evaluation ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' Right ventricular structure ', ' Right Ventricles ', ' Right Ventricular Dysfunction ', ' Morphology ', ' Nature ', ' Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy ', ' Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' cardiac imaging ', ' cardiac scanning ', ' heart scanning ', ' heart imaging ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' computer science ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Categories ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' performance tests ', ' cardiovascular imaging ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Ventricular ', ' Derivation procedure ', ' Derivation ', ' pulmonary arterial hypertension ', ' pulmonary artery hypertension ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Framingham Heart Study ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' temporal measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' hands on research ', ' Data Science ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' study population ', ' healthcare community ', ' health care community ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' neural network architecture ', ' neural net architecture ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,K99,2021,154780,CA-28
"Novel Techniques for Evaluating and Assessing Symptoms, Affect. Heart Rhythm and Functional Status in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation: miAfib Project Project Summary/Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent, major arrhythmia in the United States. It leads to an increased risk of stroke, congestive heart failure, and overall mortality. AF is also characterized by symptoms in a majority of patients that can result in significant decreases in health related quality of life and functional status, which are strong predictors of all-cause and cardiovascular hospitalizations in patients with AF. Therefore, improvement in symptoms is an important therapeutic goal in the management of patients with AF along with reducing the risk of stroke and mortality. However, previous studies evaluating symptoms in AF have been limited by their retrospective assessment of symptoms that limits our ability to assess the relationship between heart rhythm, symptoms, affect and functional status in real time. To address all of these gaps, we propose an innovative study that will intensively examine 100 patients with paroxysmal AF using a continuous heart rhythm recorder and a novel mobile application to collect data on symptom and affect ratings during multiple occasions across a day for three weeks. We will then be able to examine the relationship between symptoms, affect, heart rhythm as well as additional features within the ECG recording and assess their effect on functional status in patients with AF. We hypothesize that 1) some symptoms will be much more specifically indicative of being in AF (e.g. palpitations) than others (e.g. fatigue) 2) ECG features derived from signal processing and machine learning algorithms (especially those that serve as surrogates for autonomic function) will be more sensitive and specific for determining the presence and severity of symptoms compared to average heart rate 3) there will be a strong relationship between affect, and both symptoms and functional status . The overarching goal of this proposal is for candidate (Hamid Ghanbari, MD, MPH) to develop an independent research program examining symptoms and associated decline in functional status in patients with paroxysmal AF. The candidate will build upon his previous training by partnering with a team of mentors who are experts in ecological momentary assessment methodology, signal processing and machine learning, affect, and functional status to acquire expertise in evaluation of repeated, real-time assessments of symptoms and to explore novel ECG features that predict symptoms beyond the presence or absence of AF. In concert with the proposed study, the candidate will also pursue didactic training and one-on-one mentoring related to his research aims. This proposal will more clearly characterize symptoms and their physiological and psychological correlates and their subsequent influence on functional status in patients with AF. The insights obtained through this proposal could eventually lead to individualized behavioral and medical interventions that best address these symptoms and associated dysfunction. Project Narrative - Public Health Relevance Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent arrhythmia in the United States and is associated with an increase in the risk of stroke, congestive heart failure and overall mortality. Despite the importance of AF, our understanding of symptoms associated with AF is limited by studies that rely on evaluation of symptoms based on a single clinical visit. The overarching goal of this proposal is to explore the complex relationship between symptoms, heart rhythm, and affect and assess their influence on day-to-day functioning using wearable sensors and a smartphone based mobile application.","Novel Techniques for Evaluating and Assessing Symptoms, Affect.

"Noninvasive Testing of Coronary Microvascular Reactivity Using High-resolution Free-breathing MRI PROJECT SUMMARY It was long taken for granted that obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) is the primary driver of angina and major adverse cardiac events. However, recent landmark studies have shown that up to 50% of the patients referred for diagnostic testing have ischemia with no obstructive CAD (INOCA). A large proportion of INOCA patients have coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD), which even in the absence of flow-limiting stenoses can lead to myocardial ischemia and carries a high risk of adverse events. The reference standard for assessment of CMD is the functional coronary reactivity (CR) test, which is invasive. Despite key studies showing value of stratifying therapy based on CR testing, the practical utility of CR testing in the INOCA population is limited by its invasive nature, which carries serious risks even at experienced centers. Hence, a noninvasive approach that can detect and stage the severity of CMD would be invaluable for managing INOCA patients. Driven by this unmet need, prior studies have employed imaging approaches to index myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) against CR; however, the association shown to date between MPR and CR impairment has been weak, likely due to the suboptimal sensitivity of MPR to subendocardial myocardial blood flow (MBF) deficits which is a hallmark of CMD. Studies using invasive microsphere-based methods have established a stress subendocardial-to-subepicardial (endo-epi) MBF gradient of larger than 1.0 in healthy animals, and shown that it decreases well below 1 under abnormally elevated microvascular resistance. However, noninvasive detection of endo-epi MBF gradients using existing imaging strategies is challenging because of the need to resolve MBF transmurally. We have developed new MRI strategies aimed at overcoming key barriers for accurate evaluation of endo-epi MBF gradients and applied them in preliminary animal and patient studies. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that in the setting of CMD, impaired microvascular CR manifests as a stress-induced endo- epi MBF gradient, and the magnitude of this gradient significantly correlates with CMD severity. To test this hypothesis, we propose 3 specific aims. In Aim 1, we will develop a free-breathing artifact-free MRI technique optimized for high-resolution imaging of endo-epi MBF gradients, combined with a machine learning approach for fully-automated objective quantification of MBF gradients. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that CMD severity can be staged on the basis of MRI-derived stress MBF gradient in a pig model of CMD. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that CMD severity in INOCA patients is highly correlated with MRI-derived stress MBF gradient. This project brings together multiple interdisciplinary investigators with a strong collective track record in developing cardiac imaging strategies to advance a noninvasive approach for determining CMD severity based on the MRI-derived stress MBF gradient. Hence the proposal is a major step towards improving the management of INOCA patients and towards imaging-guided evaluation of novel therapies aimed at CMD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent landmark studies have provided evidence that “small vessel” coronary dysfunction in patients with otherwise normal coronary arteries is a major cause of heart disease and can lead to poor health outcomes including heart failure.

"Robot-Assisted 3D ICE Catheter for Cardiac Ablation ABSTRACT  Although the cardiac ablation procedure for atrial fibrillation has a wide adoption rate, it also has a high recurrence of arrhythmia primarily due to the creation of suboptimal lesions. The procedure is also associated with complications including cardiac perforation, tamponade, atrio-esophageal fistulas and thrombus. Repeated and prolonged X-ray exposure for the clinician can also lead to enhanced risk of cancer. A fluoroless approach using intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) is becoming a more widely adopted imaging option due to the absence of ionizing radiation and the possibility of real-time monitoring of the created lesions. However, the ICE- guided approach suffers from significant shortcomings, which include poor dexterity of the ICE catheter, difficulty in simultaneously manipulating the ICE and ablation catheters, unintuitive image orientation and noisy image quality. There is therefore an unmet need to overcome these shortcomings of the ICE-guided approach to enable better lesion creation and reduced complications associated with the cardiac ablation procedure. The long-term goal of this research is to develop robotic technologies, control and machine learning algorithms to enable ICE- guided cardiac ablation procedures. The objective is to develop a novel robotic manipulator, a steerable ICE catheter, and machine learning and control algorithms to manipulate the ICE catheter and monitor the created lesions in real-time. The rationale that underlies the proposed research is that the robot-assisted steerable ICE catheter with the catheter tracking algorithms will enable simultaneous manipulation of the ICE and ablation catheters. Further, the machine learning algorithms to monitor therapy will reduce the risk of complications, while ensuring the creation of necrotic lesions, thereby reducing the recurrence of AF. In this proposal, we plan to pursue the following specific aims: 1) Design, develop, and model a steerable 3D ICE catheter with enhanced dexterity. 2) Design and develop a robotic manipulator and associated control algorithms to allow for precise manipulation of the ICE catheter. 3) Develop machine-learning and vision-based algorithms integrated with a navigation system for tracking the ablation catheter, and monitoring therapy. 4) Validate the robotic ICE system in heart phantom and porcine models. The proposed research is significant since it will allow for better therapeutic outcomes by reducing recurrence rates and complications associated with cardiac ablation, and avoiding exposure of the patient and clinical care team to X-ray radiation. The proposed research is innovative in that it builds on state-of-the-art robotics technology, machine learning and vision algorithms to enable fluoroless ICE- guided cardiac ablation procedures. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed study addresses an important and under-investigated area of treating atrial fibrillation using a completely fluoroless approach with ICE imaging. The proposed research is significant since it will allow for better therapeutic outcomes by reducing recurrence rates and complications associated with cardiac ablation, and avoiding exposure of the patient and clinical care team to X-ray radiation.",Robot-Assisted 3D ICE Catheter for Cardiac Ablation,10187566,R01EB028278,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Arrhythmia ', ' Cardiac Arrhythmia ', ' Heart Arrhythmias ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Canada ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Echocardiography ', ' Echocardiogram ', ' Transthoracic Echocardiography ', ' heart sonography ', ' Esophageal Fistula ', ' Fluoroscopy ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Heart ', ' Heart Atrium ', ' Atrial ', ' Cardiac Atrium ', ' atrium ', ' Hospitals ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Myocardium ', ' cardiac muscle ', ' heart muscle ', ' Ontario ', ' Patients ', ' Pulmonary veins ', ' Ionizing radiation ', ' Ionizing Electromagnetic Radiation ', ' Radiation-Ionizing Total ', ' ionizing output ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Robotics ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Surgical Instruments ', ' Family suidae ', ' Pigs ', ' Suidae ', ' Swine ', ' porcine ', ' suid ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' X-Ray Radiation ', ' X-ray ', ' Xray ', ' Catheters ', ' Thrombus ', ' Cardiac ablation ', ' Catheter Ablation ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Lesion ', ' Intuition ', ' lightweight ', ' light weight ', ' Robot ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' Radius ', ' Radial ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Perforation ', ' cancer risk ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' phantom model ', ' kinematic model ', ' kinematics ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Microbubbles ', ' Necrotic Lesion ', ' Address ', ' therapy outcome ', ' therapeutic outcome ', ' Monitor ', ' Cardiac ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' time use ', ' robot assistance ', ' robot assisted ', ' robotic assistance ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Navigation System ', ' Coupling ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinical care ', ' dexterity ', ' image guided ', ' image guidance ', ' radio frequency ', ' radiofrequency ', ' real time monitoring ', ' realtime monitoring ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine vision ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' porcine model ', ' pig model ', ' piglet model ', ' swine model ', ' ']",NIBIB,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,379119,MA-07
