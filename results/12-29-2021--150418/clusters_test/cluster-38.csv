"Effects of marijuana use on inflammation and vascular injury in adults with HIV infection Project Summary The goal of this proposal is to characterize biomarkers of marijuana smoke exposure in ART-treated HIV+ adults over age 40, and their relationship to inflammation and vascular injury in heavy users. Marijuana and tobacco smoking are both prevalent among HIV+ populations, but their individual and combined impacts on inflammation and cardiovascular risk are unknown. Preliminary studies using longitudinal data from a prospective cohort showed that chronic heavy marijuana smoking has no significant effect on HIV disease markers, but is associated with increased rates of incident cardiovascular events in ART-treated HIV+ men age 40-60 independently of tobacco smoking and traditional risk factors. Furthermore, we showed that heavy marijuana and/or tobacco smoking was associated with elevated WBC and neutrophil counts, immune activation, inflammation, and vascular injury in ART-treated HIV+ smokers. We hypothesize that specific combustion products in marijuana and tobacco smoke, including acrolein, other reactive aldehydes, and VOCs, can induce proinflammatory responses mediated through activated neutrophils and monocytes that promote chronic inflammation in ART-treated adults, contributing to cardiovascular risk by promoting lipid peroxidation, coagulation, vascular inflammation, and endothelial injury, while attenuating protective responses. We further hypothesize that these effects are additive upon dual exposure to both marijuana and tobacco smoke and augmented by HIV infection. To address these questions, we will use clinical samples and data from well- characterized longitudinal HIV+ cohorts to characterize marijuana smoke exposure biomarkers in plasma and urine samples and their relationship to inflammation, oxidative stress, and vascular injury. Bioinformatics, computational modeling, and cell culture models will be used to build and test models to explain the effects of specific constituents of marijuana smoke on inflammatory pathways, and how these pathways are modified in the setting of HIV infection. These studies will provide information that helps to explain chronic inflammation and elevated cardiovascular risk in ART-treated HIV+ adults, safety profiles of smoked cannabinoids, and potential strategies for therapeutic intervention. Project Narrative The goal of this proposal is to characterize markers of marijuana smoke exposure in ART-treated HIV+ adults over age 40, and their relationship to inflammation and vascular injury in chronic heavy users. These studies will elucidate mechanisms by which smoked marijuana can impact inflammation and health outcomes in HIV+ individuals, and provide new information related to safety profiles of cannabinoids and development of therapeutic interventions.",Effects of marijuana use on inflammation and vascular injury in adults with HIV infection,10107795,R01DA046203,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency

"Physiology-driven seizure management post-cardiac arrest PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dr. Edilberto Amorim is a neurologist with subspecialty training in critical care and epilepsy who aims to employ biomedical technology innovations in brain monitoring to personalize treatment for patients with hypoxic- ischemic brain injury post-cardiac arrest. This career development award and its rigorous curriculum will establish Dr. Amorim as a clinician-scientist with independent expertise in: 1) Deep learning applied to physiology time-series, 2) Causal inference for observational data, and 3) Quantitative brain imaging. Every year, more than 500,000 Americans have a cardiac arrest. Brain injury is the number one cause of death for patients surviving initial resuscitation, and refractory seizures and other seizure-like brain activity are diagnosed in up to 50% of patients. Despite being a common complication, outcomes are dismal and current treatment strategies for seizures post-cardiac arrest are limited. Dr. Amorim aims to identify physiology-driven biomarkers of resilience to hypoxic-ischemic brain injury by utilizing state-of-the-art computational methods and a massive EEG and neuroimaging dataset with >1,500 subjects. His central hypothesis is that specific time- dependent changes in spike and accompanying EEG activity during cardiac arrest treatment predict seizure control and, ultimately, neurological recovery. The primary objectives of this proposal are: 1) Identify early longitudinal epileptiform EEG phenotypes predictive of neurological recovery using interpretable and deep learning algorithms; 2) Establish quantitative EEG biomarkers of seizure treatment response to anesthetics; and 3) Estimate the causal effect of rapid seizure treatment with anesthetics in preventing structural brain injury quantified with brain MRI. Dr. Amorim has generated preliminary data to demonstrate the feasibility of modeling EEG phenotypes longitudinally for outcome prediction and has applied quantitative EEG biomarkers to predict degree of brain injury on brain MRI. His primary mentor in this proposal will be Dr. Edward Chang, a neuroscientist and leader in human neurophysiology research. His co-mentors will include Dr. Brandon Westover, an authority in machine learning applied to critical care EEG, and Dr. Donna Ferriero, an accomplished translational and neuroimaging investigator in hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Additional mentoring in quantitative neuroimaging (Dr. Srikantan Nagarajan) and biostatistics (Dr. Charles McCulloch) will be essential components of his training. These aims are expected to establish early non-invasive predictive biomarkers of neurological recovery and seizure control that may: 1) Guide patient selection for clinical trials enrichment and 2) Serve as target to therapeutic interventions after hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. By leveraging the deep expertise of a cross-disciplinary group of world-class mentors and the unparalleled innovation environments of the University of California, San Francisco and the Bay Area, Dr. Amorim will be ideally positioned to uncover fundamental knowledge about epileptogenesis after acute brain injury as well as spearhead clinical trials focused on improving outcomes meaningful to cardiac arrest patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiac arrest impacts the lives of 500,000 Americans every year, and nearly half of patients surviving the initial resuscitation will develop seizures or seizure-like brain activity as a complication of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. We aim to reduce secondary brain injury and neurological disability from seizures after cardiac arrest by personalizing seizure treatment using EEG and brain MRI biomarkers of neuro-recovery. We expect that the outcome of the proposed studies will provide critical knowledge about epileptogenesis after hypoxic-ischemic brain injury andguide the development of goal-directed seizure treatment

"q4DE: A Biomarker for Image-Guided, Post-MI Hydrogel Therapy Project Summary/Abstract  Ischemic heart disease remains the top cause of death in the world. Acute myocardial infarction (MI) causes regional dysfunction which places remote areas of the heart at a mechanical disadvantage resulting in long term adverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling and complicating congestive heart failure (CHF). The course of MI and post-MI remodeling is complex and includes vascular and myocellular injury, acute and chronic inflammation, alterations of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and angiogenesis. Stress echocardiography is a clinically established, cost-effective technique for detecting and characterizing coronary artery disease and myocardial injury by imaging the LV at rest and after either exercise or pharmacologically-induced stress to reveal ischemia and/or scar. In our previous effort on this project, we developed quantitative 3D differential deformation measures for stress echocardiography from 4DE-derived LV strain maps taken at rest and after dobutamine stress. These measures can localize and quantify the extent and severity of LV myocardial injury and reveal ischemic regions. We now propose that improved versions of these same measures can be used for both targeting of therapy and outcomes assessment in the treatment of adverse local myocardial remodeling following MI. We choose a particular up and coming therapeutic strategy as an exemplar: the local delivery of injectable hydrogels within the MI region that are intended to alter the biomechanical properties of the LV myocardium, as well as inflammation, and thereby help to minimize adverse remodeling. Our new, robust approach for estimating improved dense displacement and differential deformation measures is based on an innovative data-driven, deep feed-forward, neural network architecture that employs domain adaptation between data from labeled, carefully-constructed synthetic models of physiology and echocardiographic image formation (i.e. with ground truth), and data from unlabeled noisy in vivo porcine or human echocardiography (missing or very limited ground truth). Training is based on tens of thousands of four-dimensional (4D) image-derived patches from these two domains, initially based on displacements derived separately from shape-based processing of conventional B-mode data and block-mode, speckle-tracked processing of raw radio-frequency (RF) data; and later based on learning directly from B-mode and RF image intensity information. After non-rigid registration of rest and stress 4DE image sequences, quantitative 4D differential deformation parameters will be derived from porcine and human echocardiographic test data. These parameters will be derived at baseline, and at several timepoints after delivery of injectable hydrogels into the MI region. The ability of the differential deformation parameters derived from 4D stress echocardiography to guide local delivery of injectable hydrogels in a MI region and assess/predict outcomes will then be determined in a hybrid acute/chronic porcine model of MI and post-MI remodeling. The technique will be translated to humans and evaluated by measuring the reproducibility and the relationship to remodeling of our new robust, deep learning-based differential deformation parameters in a small cohort of subjects. Project Narrative  At the core of the proposed effort is the development and evaluation of novel 4D (three spatial dimensions over time) echocardiographic imaging, image analysis, and machine learning methods that will enable the accurate and robust quantification of changes in myocardial deformation due to stress. Our methods will use this information to guide delivery and assess outcome of a promising new therapy to improve the biomechanical properties of the heart after myocardial injury based on injectable hydrogels.","q4DE: A Biomarker for Image-Guided, Post-MI Hydrogel Therapy",10139080,R01HL121226,"['Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Blood Vessels ', '

"Understanding Response Shift in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) survivors Project Summary / Abstract Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe lung injury usually requiring mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit (ICU). While the number of ICU patients requiring mechanical ventilation is steadily increasing, in-hospital mortality is declining, creating a growing population of ARDS survivors. Such survivorship comes at a high “cost,” with ARDS patients frequently experiencing new or worsening physical, cognitive, and/or mental health impairments that last for years after ARDS. NHLBI and professional societies identify improving quality of life for ARDS survivors as a key research priority. Some ARDS survivors may adapt to new impairments over time and report improving quality of life not explained by improvements in objective measures of their physical, cognitive, and mental health. This adaptation phenomenon is known as “response shift.” We hypothesize that ARDS survivors demonstrate widely varying degrees of response shift, and that patients' baseline characteristics prior to ARDS have important associations with the magnitude of response shift after ICU discharge. We also investigate how psychosocial factors, including trait anxiety, social support, resilience, and survivor expectations for functional recovery, impact quality of life during recovery as a first step toward designing and evaluating new interventions for ARDS survivors.  This proposal will exploit a unique, pre-existing cohort of very well-characterized ARDS survivors from the NHLBI ARDS Network Long Term Outcome Study (ALTOS) containing hundreds of data elements per patient. Using modern data science methods, I will empirically evaluate the association between baseline patient characteristics and response shift between 6 and 12 months after ARDS [Aim 1], and identify the changes in specific aspects of physical, cognitive, and mental health, from among ~165 candidate measures, that best predict changes in quality of life [Aim 2]. To investigate how psychosocial factors impact quality of life, I will conduct a new, prospective, ICU cohort study of ARDS survivors to collect data for these novel analyses [Aim 3]. The results from these three Aims will generate new knowledge regarding empirically-derived, testable hypotheses about important determinants of quality of life, and provide essential data for designing future studies of interventions aimed at improving the quality of life of ARDS survivors.  This career development award provides training in data science, patient outcomes-oriented clinical research, and machine learning statistical techniques for the applicant who is a PhD-trained epidemiologist without these skills. Immediate, short-term, and long-term career goals include: (1) publishing results of the proposed research, (2) successfully competing for R-level funding to explore whether addressing psychosocial issues, including setting appropriate patient expectations for recovery, is a potentially modifiable, low-cost intervention to improve ARDS survivor's quality of life, and (3) becoming an NHLBI-funded independent research scientist who conducts innovative and methodologically rigorous data science research on ARDS outcomes. Project Narrative A large and growing number of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) survivors frequently experience new and long-lasting physical, cognitive, and mental health impairments. ARDS survivors may exhibit a phenomenon known as “response shift” in which survivors adapt to new impairments and report improving quality of life not explained by improvements in objective measures of their physical, cognitive, and mental health.

"Predicting Progression of Chronic Kidney Disease in Sickle Cell Anemia Using Machine Learning Models (PREMIER) ABSTRACT Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by a vasculopathy affecting multiple end organs, with complications including chronic kidney disease (CKD). Albuminuria, an early measure of glomerular injury, is common in SCD and predicts progressive kidney disease. Kidney function decline is faster in SCD patients than in the general African American population. The prevalence of rapid decline in SCD is 3-fold higher than in the general population. Furthermore, high-risk APOL1 variants are associated with an increased risk of albuminuria and progression of CKD in SCD. Kidney disease, regardless of severity, and rapid eGFR decline are associated with increased mortality in SCD. As such, early identification of patients at risk for progression of CKD is important to address potentially modifiable risk factors, slow eGFR decline and reduce mortality. Despite the high prevalence of CKD and its contribution to increased morbidity and mortality, available treatments for SCD-related kidney disease remain limited. Although angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and hydroxyurea decrease albuminuria in short-term studies, their benefits in preventing or slowing progressive loss of kidney function in SCD remain undefined. We have recently reported that machine learning (ML) models can identify patients at high risk for rapid decline in kidney function. Further, higher hemoglobin concentration is also an independent predictor of decreased odds of rapid kidney function decline. With the contribution of intravascular hemolysis to the pathophysiology of SCD-related glomerulopathy, voxelotor, a small molecule which modifies sickle hemoglobin oxygen affinity and improves sickle RBC survival, may decrease glomerular injury and slow the progression of CKD in individuals with SCD. In this application, we propose the conduct of a prospective, multicenter study to build a ML-based predictive model for progression of CKD in adults with SCD. Furthermore, in individuals predicted to be at risk for rapid decline in kidney function, based on the presence of persistent albuminuria (urine ACR ≥ 100 mg/g), we will evaluate the effect of voxelotor on albuminuria, rapid decline in kidney function and progression of CKD. With advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of SCD and its complications, combined with an increasing number of approved drug therapies, early identification of patients at risk for progressive kidney disease and subsequent increased risk of death is necessary to modify known risk factors, initiate targeted therapies and possibly increase life expectancy. Further, with the known contribution of hemolytic anemia to the pathogenesis of SCD-related glomerulopathy and progressive kidney disease, drugs that decrease hemolysis are likely to be beneficial in preventing and/or slowing the progression of kidney disease in this patient population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by involvement of multiple end organs, resulting in multiple complications including chronic kidney disease (CKD).

"Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury. PROJECT SUMMARY Spinal cord injury (SCI) patients experience limited functional recovery, owing in part to the paucity of axon regrowth from injured CNS neurons. Effective treatments are lacking, likely because of multiple factors, intrinsic and extrinsic, that inhibit axon growth. Thus, we require agents that target more than one source of regeneration failure. Kinases are ubiquitous signal transducers that regulate most cellular processes, including axon growth. To begin to identify compounds that positively regulate axon growth, we screened 1600 small-molecule kinase inhibitors (KIs) in an in vitro CNS neurite outgrowth assay and identified “hit” KIs that reproducibly and strongly promote outgrowth. Due to homology of catalytic domains, KIs typically inhibit multiple kinases. This makes it difficult to identify the kinase(s) that mediate a KI’s effects on cells. We used information theory and machine learning to analyze the inhibition profiles of KIs in relation to their effects on neurite outgrowth. This enabled us to identify, and later validate via siRNA knockdown in primary neurons, multiple kinase targets (i.e. kinases that should be inhibited to promote neurite outgrowth). These included previously known targets that regulate intrinsic and extrinsic inhibitor factors, in addition to several novel candidates. Conversely, we identified kinases whose activity is critical for neurite outgrowth, and whose inhibition must be avoided (anti-targets). We discovered several KIs that inhibit multiple targets and no anti-targets. These KIs strongly promoted neurite outgrowth in vitro. We tested the KI, RO48, that had the largest effect in vitro in two in vivo models. Our preliminary experiments indicate that RO48 is remarkably effective in vivo. It promoted robust axonal growth of the corticospinal tract (CST) in three separate models of CST injury (pyramidotomy, funiculotomy, dorsal hemisection), and in the dorsal hemisection model, improved forelimb function. We propose to build on these remarkable results to test the working hypothesis that the simultaneous inhibition of RO48’s five target kinases (ROCK, PKC, PRKG1, PRKX, and RPS6K) promotes sprouting and regeneration of CST axons. This will be accomplished using viral vectors to knock down expression of the different target kinases individually and in combination. We will do knockdown in CST neurons in the cortex. We will assess CST axon growth at the injury site using light microscopy. We will also perform experiments to determine if RO48-induced CST axon growth promotes axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and whether RO48 improves behavioral outcomes such as grasping and walking after a contusion injury.These experiments will 1) validate novel kinases as in vivo targets for future development of SCI therapeutics 2) determine whether these kinases regulate CST axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and 3) confirm whether the substantial stimulation of axon growth induced by treatment with RO48 improves motor outcomes in a clinically relevant contusion model.  PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed experiments aim to understand how small-molecule drug-like compounds increase the ability of nerve cells to grow long processes and re-form connections. Validating the molecular targets of these compounds for in vivo nerve growth will enable future drug discovery projects focused on these targets.",Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury.,10393353,R01NS100531,"['inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Axon ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Contusions ', ' Bruise ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Forelimb ', ' Future ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' In Vitro ', ' Information Theory ', ' Nerve ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Phosphotransferases ', ' Kinases ', ' Phosphotransferase Gene ', ' Transphosphorylases ', ' Natural regeneration ', ' Regeneration ', ' regenerate ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Spinal cord injury ', ' Spinal Cord Trauma ', ' Spinal Trauma ', ' Spinal cord injured ', ' Traumatic Myelopathy ', ' Testing ', ' Transducers ', ' Walking ', ' Neurites ', ' Mediating ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' improved ', ' Dorsal ', ' Site ', ' grasp ', ' Grips ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Therapeutic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' light microscopy ', ' Source ', ' experience ', ' axonal sprouting ', ' functional recovery ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' Catalytic Core ', ' Catalytic Region ', ' Catalytic Site ', ' Catalytic Subunit ', ' Catalytic Domain ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' drug discovery ', ' Corticospinal Tracts ', ' Short interfering RNA ', ' siRNA ', ' Small Interfering RNA ', ' kinase inhibitor ', ' CNS Injury ', ' injured CNS ', ' central nervous system injury ', ' small molecule ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Motor ', ' in vivo ', ' in vivo Model ', ' Viral Vector ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' axon growth ', ' axonal growth ', ' knock-down ', ' knockdown ', ' Outcome ', ' Spinal cord injury patients ', ' SCI Patients ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' targeted agent ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,16781,FL-27
"Multiparametric mapping of Covid-19 immune responses in Kidney transplant recipients Abstract As of May 2020, over five million confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally with over 400,000 associated deaths. Around 5-20% of patients develop critical illness, which predominantly manifests as acute respiratory distress syndrome. When this develops, the estimated mortality is around 40%, and as high as 80% in ventilated patients. Several early reports describe the development of an excessive inflammatory response, the so-called `cytokine storm', which is strongly associated with rapid deterioration in clinical condition and mortality. Early reports of kidney transplant recipients, who are at high risk due to chronic immunosuppression and additional comorbid diseases, portray a concerning picture. In one series of 36 patients, 39% required mechanical ventilation, 21% required renal replacement therapy, and 28% died. Of the 11 patients that were intubated, 64% died. However, there is still an unmet need of understanding disease natural course, specific risk factors, identifying biomarkers, as well as potential impact of COVID-19 on graft/patient survival in vulnerable KTRs. To fill this information gap, we propose a comprehensive observational analysis of epidemiological factors and immunological assay results in COVID19-infected KTRs at 2 medical centers at the epicenter of COVID19 infection in NYC (Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan and Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx). We hypothesize that specific recipient clinical characteristics affect COVID-19 clinical course and that recipient immunosuppression in KTRs alters the ability of COVID-19 KTRs to develop protective anti-COVID-19 humoral and cell-mediated immunity that contributes to the morbidity and mortality of these individuals. We will test this hypothesis by 1) examining risk factors of COVID-19 severity in a large dataset of KTRs and individuals from the general population with COVID-19 (aim 1); 2) by characterizing the COVID-19 reactive humoral and cellular immune response in serially collected samples from COVID-19 KTRs (aim 2); and 3) by comprehensive assessment of DNA and serial serum, RNA, and PBMC from COVID-19 KTRs to identify disease mechanisms and potentially informative biomarkers for outcomes (aim 3). The proposed work is significant because of the high incidence of the disease, rate of community transmission, high mortality, and absence of clearly effective therapeutic options. Our studies will be amongst the first to define risk factors, predictors, and pathogenic mechanisms of COVID-19 in Kidney transplantation and may apply to recipients of other transplanted organs, as well as to individuals on chronic immunosuppression due to autoimmune diseases. Project Narrative: In this application we propose to study COVID-19 disease from SARS-CoV-2 virus in the unique risk population of Kidney transplant recipients. Using data and bio-samples from two hospital systems at the forefront of this pandemic and the highest COVID-19 case loads, we wil identify clinical and biomarker risk profiles for disease severity in transplant patients with COVID disease. In addition, we will use novel assays for humoral and cell-mediated immunity to study COVID immune responses in these immunosupppressed patients and compare with controls.",Multiparametric mapping of

"An advanced functional MRI study of frontostriatal injury in adults with HIV PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In the era of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), the prevalence of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, or HAND, remains high in people with HIV (PWH); as a result, there is increasing pressure to identify neural targets for effective therapies. However, to develop effective HAND treatments, there is a strong need for the development of sensitive behavioral tests that can quickly screen and effectively identify probable neurocognitive impairment in PWH and biomarkers that can accurately determine HAND status and evaluate therapeutic effects. This 5-year cross-sectional and longitudinal study is theoretically driven and specifically designed to tackle these challenges. Neural injury to the frontostriatal circuits (plus hippocampus, thalamus, and other associated regions) has long been recognized as a key component in HAND; however, the association between frontostriatal injury and HAND status remains to be elucidated. Recent findings suggest that injury to different key regions in the frontostriatal circuits may play differential roles in HAND status: frontal injury is more prevalent in PWH, but striatal injury better predicts HAND status. This suggests that an accurate assessment of neural injury at different frontostriatal regions (plus other key regions such as hippocampus and thalamus) may have the potential to serve as a biomarker to assist with HAND diagnosis and characterization. To test this hypothesis, we will investigate frontostriatal injury in PWH using two behavioral paradigms that are known to involve distinct frontostriatal regions, along with two advanced functional MRI (fMRI) techniques, fMRI- adaptation (fMRI-A) and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA). Compared to conventional fMRI techniques, fMRI-A and MVPA techniques can better estimate neural tuning/selectivity that can be directly related to behavioral performance. Briefly, we hypothesize that frontostriatal injury – a central component in HAND – is highly prevalent in PWH and can be assessed behaviorally via two behavioral paradigms (Aim 1), and neurally via fMRI-A & MVPA (Aim 2). The integration of behavioral and fMRI data will help to assess the degree of neural injury at different frontostriatal and associated regions, which in turn may serve as a biomarker for HAND status (Aim 3). The probable impact of common comorbidities (e.g., history of substance and alcohol abuse, etc.) will also be investigated. In summary, this proposal is theoretically driven and highly innovative, with a strong promise for future clinically relevant development. The feasibility of the proposed research is supported by a strong foundation in cognitive neuroscience and neuroHIV, strong preliminary data, and an established research team. The success of this proposed project may help to develop sensitive behavioral tests that can effectively detect mild neurocognitive impairment in PWH, and a biomarker that can assist in determining HAND status/severity. PROJECT NARRATIVE In the era of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), the prevalence of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, or HAND, remains high in people with HIV (PWH). Neural injury to the frontostriatal circuits has been proposed as a key component in HAND, but the precise neural mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Built upon rich cognitive neuroscience literature and inspired by recent findings in neuroHIV research, we propose a functional MRI (fMRI) study to investigate functional disruptions to the frontostriatal circuits in PWH, using a novel combination of established behavioral test paradigms and advanced fMRI techniques.",An advanced functional MRI study of frontostriatal injury in adults with HIV,10450246,R56NS124422,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' male ', ' Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Play ', ' pressure ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' virology ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' Alcohol abuse ', ' EtOH abuse ', ' alcohol co-abuse ', ' alcohol problem ', ' ethanol abuse ', ' hazardous alcohol use ', ' problem alcohol use ', ' problem drinking ', ' problematic alcohol consumption ', ' problematic alcohol use ', ' Surrogate Markers ', ' surrogate bio-markers ', ' surrogate biomarkers ', ' Mediating ', ' nerve injury ', ' neural injury ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Anterior ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' cerebral atrophy ', ' brain atrophy ', ' cortical atrophy ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' cognitive function ', ' Severities ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' behavioral test ', ' behavior test ', ' Modality ', ' abuse of substances ', ' substance abuse ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' Brain region ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Therapeutic Effect ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' Behavioral Paradigm ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Neurocognitive Deficit ', ' IQ Deficit ', ' intelligence quotient deficit ', ' neurocognitive decline ', ' neurocognitive impairment ', ' mild neurocognitive impairment ', ' Prevalence ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' mitochondrial dysfunction ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder ', ' HIV 1 associated neurocognitive disorder ', ' HIV-1 associated neurocognitive disorder ', ' neuroAIDS ', ' neuro-AIDS ', ' neuro-HIV ', ' neuroHIV ', ' ']",NINDS,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R56,2021,585657,DC-98
"Characterizing Activity Patterns in Functional Mobility After Spinal Cord Injury Abstract  My career and research interests have centered on the science of movement and factors that maximize mobility. Whether this is through injury prevention, assistive technology, or biomechanical optimization, it is critical to clinical practice that these processes be well understood so that we can provide the most informed patient treatments. In order to carry out more effective clinically-based studies that inform patient care, it is my desire to continue my training through practical experiences with both formal coursework and a oversight by a strong mentoring team in the following domains: (1) activity-based data collection and analysis and (2) use of advanced statistical methods to investigate multiple factors. Through the K23, I will also gain experience specifically focused on my transition to independence; this will include grantsmanship and lab management, leading the design and implementation of clinical and translational studies, management of personnel and meetings, and pursuit of tenure and an R01. This continued training will be completed in the context of a research study that characterizes activity patterns in functional mobility after spinal cord injury (SCI).  Aim 1 of this study is to predict mobility at discharge and at 1-year post-discharge, based upon patient characteristics and activity during IPR. Mobility outcomes can be challenging to predict, particularly for individuals with moderate strength and sensory impairments. Selecting appropriate training is increasingly important with shrinking lengths of stay and there are potential opportunity costs and adverse consequences on quality of life and participation for individuals who do not receive appropriate interventions. Additional activity measures that we can collect early in the IPR stay, by utilizing low-cost sensors, have the potential to provide rich data sets that we can examine to garner insight into outcomes with little administrative burden. Using a machine learning approach, we will investigate patient characteristics and activity-monitoring data to improve predictive models of patient mobility based on data acquired early in the rehab stay. Achieving these aims will improve patient and clinician understanding of anticipated changes in mobility in the year following SCI to appropriately target expectations and interventions to maximize functional outcomes.  Aim 2 of this proposal is to quantitatively evaluate functional mobility changes (i.e., wheeling walking or changes in activity within mode) in the first year post injury and their impact on quality of life and participation. There are factors following discharge that challenge or enhance the sustainability of walking for functional mobility including energy costs, neurologic recovery and biopsychosocial factors such as resilience, self-efficacy, environment, and caregiver support. The association between these factors and post-discharge changes in mobility are not well understood. Using wearable sensors we will quantify time spent walking and wheeling to identify transitions between walking and wheeling, identify factors that contribute to these transitions and investigate their impact on participation. Project Narrative In the context of steadily decreasing lengths of stay for inpatient rehabilitation, and in conjunction with therapy caps in outpatient therapy settings that have led to an overall decrease in patient time spent within a clinical context, it is becoming ever more critical that rehabilitation interventions appropriately target functional mobility (walking or wheeling). Unfortunately, the needed data on how mobility changes following discharge and those factors that most accurately predict patient outcomes is lacking. This proposal seeks to improve patient and clinician understanding of anticipated changes in mobility in the year following SCI so that expectations and interventions can be appropriately targeted to maximize functional outcomes through the following aims: (1) predict mobility at 1 year post-discharge based on patient characteristics, biopyschosocial factors, and activity during inpatient rehabilitation and (2) quantitatively evaluate functional mobility changes in the first year post injury and their impact on quality of life and participation.",Characterizing Activity Patterns in Functional Mobility After Spinal Cord Injury,10246175,K23HD096134,"['Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Environment ', ' Exertion ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Joints ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Mentors ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Personnel Management ', ' Probability ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Self-Help Devices ', ' Assistive Technology ', ' assisted device ', ' assistive device ', ' Esthesia ', ' Sensation ', ' Spinal cord injury ', ' Spinal Cord Trauma ', ' Spinal Trauma ', ' Spinal cord injured ', ' Traumatic Myelopathy ', ' Time ', ' Wheelchairs ', ' Wheel Chairs ', ' mobile assistance device ', ' mobile assistance system ', ' mobile assistive device ', ' mobile assistive system ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' injury prevention ', ' Secondary to ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' career ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' muscle strength ', ' Coin ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' expectation ', ' research study ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Membrum superius ', ' Upper Limb ', ' Upper Extremity ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' opportunity cost ', ' cost ', ' inpatient service ', ' inpatient care ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' functional outcomes ', ' resilience ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Outcome ', ' Kinesiology ', ' Movement science ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' translational study ', ' person centered ', ' clinical care ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' neurological recovery ', ' improved mobility ', ' mobility enhancement ', ' mobility improvement ', ' optimized mobility ', ' clinical practice ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' gait rehabilitation ', ' gait recovery ', ' gait rehab ', ' gait retraining ', ' gait training ', ' Caregiver support ', ' Care giver support ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable biosensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' Cost efficiency ', ' preservation ', ' clinical implementation ', ' patient mobility ', ' biopsychosocial factor ', ' biopsychosocial variable ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2021,127999,PA-18
"Evaluating associations between trauma-related characteristics and functional recovery in individuals with spinal cord injury Project Summary World Health Organization established that every year, around the world, between 250,000 and 500,000 people suffer a spinal cord injury (SCI). While existing research suggests links between the injury event, early care, and rehabilitation outcomes, there still remains a critical knowledge gap – about how characteristics associated with trauma and acute phases of SCI can allow us to better understand functional recovery post- SCI. In the past, this research was partly hampered due to databases that either focused on trauma-care or inpatient rehabilitation. However, using advanced analytical methods, we are now in a position to combine databases that contain trauma and acute phase-related variables with patient-level characteristics to assess longitudinal functional recovery over time. Trauma and acute phase-related variables include type of trauma, cause of injury, process of care, clinical data, and outcome data during acute care. The overall objective of this study is to use trauma and acute phase-related variables to explain the longitudinal functional recovery of individuals with SCI, from acute to post-acute to community. This will be achieved by probabilistically linking the Pennsylvania Trauma Systems Outcomes Study (PTOS) database with the National Spinal Cord Injury Model Systems (SCIMS) database. The PTOS and SCIMS databases provide complimentary information about trauma and acute phases of SCI from acute hospital to inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF) to community. The long-term goal of our research is to identify trauma and acute phase-related variables that can be utilized during acute care and post-acute rehabilitation interventions to improve clinical decision making, which in turn enhances rehabilitation programs.The central hypothesis of this proposal is that trauma and acute phase- related variables, combined with patient-level characteristics, will significantly predict longitudinal functional recovery in individuals post-SCI. Our hypothesis is guided by prior research and our pilot work with the PTOS database. A primary objective of this proposal is to examine the association between trauma and acute phase- related variables with functional improvements during IRF in individuals with traumatic SCI using machine learning ensemble methods (Aim 1). A secondary objective of this study is to develop longitudinal trajectories of functional recovery over a period of 1-year post-SCI taking into account trauma, acute phase, and patient- level characteristics during acute, post-acute, and community living using growth curve modelling (Aim 2). The proposed study will yield novel insights about the relationship between trauma and acute phase-related variables with functional status.

"Biomechanical and Biological Predictors of Cartilage Health Following Meniscus Injury Abstract  Injury of the meniscus is frequently associated with early onset osteoarthritis (OA). Partial meniscectomy to remove the damaged meniscal tissue is the most commonly performed orthopaedic procedure. While this procedure can provide symptomatic relief in the short term, nearly 35% of patients develop radiographic evidence of OA within 5-7 years following surgery. However, the causes for this early onset OA are unknown. One potential pathway for the progression of knee OA following meniscectomy is through altered loading of the articular cartilage. However, other studies suggest that biological factors, such as joint inflammation may play an important role. Recently, through a combination of MR imaging, 3D modeling, and biplanar radiography, our team has shown that medial meniscal injury alters the cartilage-to-cartilage contact strains in both the medial and lateral compartments. In addition, we found that increased strain was correlated with increased levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity in the synovial fluid, a biomarker which may be indicative of joint degradation. Together, these results suggest that biomechanical and biological factors play an important role in the development of OA after meniscal injury. However, the role of partial meniscectomy on these changes is unclear. Thus, a comprehensive evaluation of the biomechanical and biological environment of the joint before and after partial meniscectomy will elucidate the factors that contribute to early onset OA. Our overall hypothesis is that following partial meniscectomy, both biomechanical and biological changes in the joint will predict cartilage degeneration. Furthermore, when biomechanical and biological predictors are combined together with patient demographics and clinical characteristics, we will identify well-defined clinical phenotypes of patients at high risk of cartilage degeneration.  Cartilage degeneration will be assessed through MR-based measures of cartilage thickness and composition. Using high speed biplanar x-ray and MR imaging, in vivo cartilage strains in both knees of patients with unilateral medial meniscus injury will be measured in response to treadmill walking prior to surgery and after surgery. Synovial fluid and serum will also be collected and a panel of pro-inflammatory mediators and tissue metabolic biomarkers will be measured. Synovial fluid immune cell analyses will be performed by flow cytometry. Using these biomechanical and biological factors, we will identify participants at increased risk for cartilage degeneration at two years after surgery. Then, using predictive models combining biomechanical factors, biological factors, demographics, and clinical characteristics, we will develop well-defined clinical phenotypes of cartilage degeneration risk. Importantly, the development of these phenotypes will enable targeted treatment approaches focused on surgery, pharmaceutical targets, and non-pharmacological interventions, such as physical rehabilitation strategies or weight loss, to prevent cartilage degeneration. Project Narrative Meniscus injuries are very common and frequently lead to early onset osteoarthritis, a leading cause of disability.

"Characterizing clinical and biologic features of persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Research: Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) requiring mechanical ventilation is a common, costly condition with high mortality, yet treatment remains supportive. Identifying effective targeted therapeutics in heterogeneous conditions like AHRF depends on characterizing subsets, or sub-phenotypes, of patients with high likelihood of disease related events or response to therapy. This project will characterize a novel sub- phenotype called persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure (PHRF) among mechanically ventilated AHRF patients, with PHRF defined by ongoing mechanical ventilation and hypoxemia on ICU day 3. Using clinical trajectory to define sub-phenotypes in other heterogeneous syndromes has helped delineate patients with distinct prognosis and highlight biologic mechanisms contributing to trajectories. With large, independent prospective ICU cohorts from the University of Washington and Vanderbilt University, Dr. Sathe will address the following aims: (1) identify clinical factors on ICU day 1 associated with PHRF (2) determine biologic features of PHRF by analyzing ICU day 1 and day 3 circulating biomarkers of lung injury and (3) develop and validate a multivariable model that predicts PHRF on ICU day 3. Understanding risk factors for PHRF will help hone in on the early mechanisms important for pathologic responses to lung injury. Advantages to sub- phenotyping within AHRF rather than ARDS (where prior efforts were focused) include expanding the scope of patients we target for therapy and improving reliability of study definitions. In addition, discriminating between patients who will and will not develop PHRF will aid clinical prognostication, resource allocation, and targeted trial enrollment of patients unlikely to improve with existing treatment. The results will fill key knowledge gaps prioritized by the NHLBI regarding which factors determine risk for persistent hypoxemia, and the degree to which these factors overlap across ARDS and other conditions in AHRF. Candidate/Environment: With the support of the University of Washington, Dr. Mark Wurfel, Dr. Catherine “Terri” Hough, and biostatistician Leila Zelnick, PhD, this award will help establish Dr. Sathe’s career as a translational physician-scientist practicing Pulmonary and Critical Care. Through the proposed research, she will develop fundamental skills for analysis of longitudinal cohort data, contemporary machine learning methods for prediction, and high-quality measurement and analysis of lung injury biomarkers. This work will identify biologic pathways for more in-depth study in prospective AHRF cohorts, which she will pursue in a future K23. She plans to establish a career examining the heterogeneity of acute respiratory failure and other ICU syndromes, to advance the development of targeted therapeutics for critically ill patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE The heterogeneity of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF), which includes such conditions as the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pneumonia, has hampered the identification of effective, targeted therapeutics. Characterizing a subset of mechanically ventilated AHRF patients with persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure (PHRF) will help identify patients unlikely to improve with existing treatments and early biologic events leading to persistent hypoxemia.

"Built Environment, Pedestrian Injuries and Deep Learning (BEPIDL) Study PROJECT SUMMARY Road traffic injuries are a major contributor to the burden of disease globally with nearly 1.3 million deaths globally and as many as 50 million injured annually with pedestrians and cyclists in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) among the most affected. Road infrastructure of the built environment (e.g., sidewalks), neighborhood design (e.g., street connectivity) and urban development (e.g., urban sprawl) are key determinants of the risk of pedestrian injuries. In LMICs, poor road infrastructure and neighborhood design are acknowledged as being important contributors to rising numbers of road traffic injuries and deaths, but there are few studies systematically identifying and quantifying what specific features of the built environment are contributing to motor vehicle collisions in these settings. Within LMIC cities, there are often large disparities where infrastructure is improved that reflect socioeconomic characteristics, leading to health inequities in road traffic injury. The paucity of georeferenced data on the built environment in LMICs has made research on road traffic injuries more difficult, though recent advances in computer vision and image analysis combined with Big Data of publicly available, georeferenced, images of roads worldwide (e.g., Google Street View, GSV) can help overcome the paucity of data and the cost and time limitations of collecting and analyzing data on the built environment in LMICs. Automated image analysis has largely been made possible via deep learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence and machine learning and relies on training neural networks to detect and label specific objects within images. These methods can drastically reduce the barriers to citywide built environment and traffic safety research in LMIC cities, thus substantially increasing research capacity and generalizability. My career goal is to become an independent investigator in global urban health with a focus on road safety and the built environment in LMICs. I propose undertaking research and training in deep learning methods applied to public health in the setting of Bogota, Colombia: 1) Develop neural networks to create a database of BE features of the road infrastructure from image data and to create neighborhood typologies from those features; 2) Assess the association between neighborhood-level BE features and typologies and pedestrian collisions and fatalities and road safety perceptions; 3) Assess the association of neighborhood social environment characteristics with pedestrian collision and fatalities, perceptions, and BE features and typologies. I am seeking additional training in 1) developing competency in deep learning methods applied to public health; 2) creating neighborhood indictors and typologies of health and the built environment; 3) applying Bayesian spatiotemporal models to understand how neighborhood characteristics and typologies influence health; 4) develop skills in multi-country collaboration, grant writing and overseeing research projects in LMICs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Roads and neighborhoods with a built environment that support safe and active transportation are a major priority in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) due to 90% of road traffic deaths occurring in these locations, especially to pedestrians and other vulnerable road users, yet data on key built environment features at a large scale are not always readily available in these settings. My career goal is to improve population health by examining the effects of the built environment and transportation on health through the adoption and use of methods that can leverage Big Data sources and answer complex, multilevel research questions by overcoming the lack of built environment data in LMICs. The proposed research uses deep learning and advanced statistical methods to create a citywide dataset of built and social environment features in Bogota, Colombia that will provide crucial data to answer questions of their impact on pedestrian injuries and deaths, as well as assessing the presence of health inequities in their distribution and that will lay the groundwork to expand these efforts to more cities in Latin America and other LMICs.","Built Environment, Pedestrian Injuries and Deep Learning (BEPIDL) Study",10264065,K01TW011782,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Cities ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Colombia ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Latin America ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Perception ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Typology ', ' Urban Developments ', ' Urban Health ', ' Writing ', ' Competence ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' career ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' computer imaging ', ' digital imaging ', ' experience ', ' computer science ', ' skills ', ' social ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' pedestrian injury ', ' cost ', ' injured ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' virtual ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Vehicle crash ', ' Automobile collision ', ' Automobile crash ', ' Car collision ', ' Car crash ', ' Motor vehicle collision ', ' Motor vehicle crash ', ' Vehicular collision ', ' Vehicular crash ', ' traffic collision ', ' traffic crash ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' high risk ', ' health inequalities ', ' Health Inequity ', ' Inequalities in Health ', ' Inequities in Health ', ' population health ', ' neighborhood association ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' built environment ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' LMIC ', ' deep learning ', ' Infrastructure ', ' neural network ', ' automated image analysis ', ' data infrastructure ', ' ']",FIC,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,K01,2021,138024,PA-03
"Defining the Pathogenesis and Prognosis of Human Acute Interstitial Nephritis Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), resulting from drug exposure, infection or autoimmune disease, is the cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) in up to 20% of patients who undergo a kidney biopsy. Even though we currently have 2 clinical interventions available to treat patients with AIN (withdrawal of the offending drug and corticosteroids), 40-60% of patients with AIN go on to develop chronic kidney disease (CKD) even when appropriately treated. Kidney damage in AIN is believed to result from immune-mediated tubular injury that eventually leads to fibrosis and permanent kidney damage.  The recent dileniation of the immune underpinnings of multiple autoimmune diseases and cancers has led to the development of targeted therapies that exhibit improved efficacy and less toxicity compared to corticosteroids. Therefore, an analysis of the immune infiltrate and resulting resident cell (tubular and vascular) responses that provides pathogenic understanding of the specific immune events that initiate and propogate AIN should lead to development and/or repurposing of targeted therapies that are more effective at resolving AIN and preventing the progression to CKD, as well as potentially less toxic.  Data from several groups, including our own, suggest that CD4+ T-helper cells (particularly the TH2/TH9 subsets) are potential drivers of AIN. We have found that TH2/TH9 cytokines IL-5 and IL-9 and some cells of type 2 immunity, mast cells and eosinophils, are higher in the urine or kidneys of patients with AIN. Based on these data, it is our hypothesis that TH2/TH9 T-helper cells in the kidney itself play an important pathogenic role in promoting tubular or vascular injury in AIN. We will test this hypothesis by performing a quantitative evaluation of the kidney immune infiltrate and accompanying tubular and vascular response in humans with AIN. We will use existing kidney biopsies, adjudicated by 3 nephropathologists as exhibiting AIN, from two university health centers (Yale and Johns Hopkins), as discovery and validation cohorts for this study. To perform the quantitative analysis we will use an imaging technique called Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) that supports the simultaneous, spatially-preserved quantification of up to 42 antibodies on a single tissue section. We have an existing library of 27 validated kidney and immune antibodies and have developed a machine learning protocol to rapidly and accurately quantify and localize all cells in the human kidney identified using IMC.  We will first increase our validated antibody panel and optimize our IMC protocol for use in the study of AIN (SA 1). We will then use IMC to identify, quantify and localize the immune and resident cell responses in 30 AIN cases and 60 non-AIN control biopsies from Yale (discovery cohort), followed by 30 AIN cases and 60 non-AIN controls from JHU (validation cohort, SA 2). Finally, we will define the relationship between cellular determinants of AIN and recovery of kidney function as well as response to steroids (SA3). Our findings will not only lead to identification of novel druggable targets in AIN, but also lead to improving clinical histological diagnosis of AIN. Acute Interstitial Nephritis (AIN) is an important cause of kidney dysfunction, and can lead to chronic kidney disease in many patients. We know that AIN occurs as an immune response in the kidney to certain drugs or infections, but do not have a clear understanding of the cell sources of the inflammation or the tubular and vascular responses. This proposal is designed to define these immune events in human kidney biopsy samples left over after clinical diagnosis has been completed, and to determine how they relate to the development of chronic kidney disease.",Defining the Pathogenesis and Prognosis of Human Acute Interstitial Nephritis,10264054,R01DK126815,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones ', ' Corticoids ', ' Corticosteroids ', ' Adult

"Improving the efficiency of randomized trials of behavioral interventions for acute and chronic respiratory failure The goal of this Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research is to enhance the ability of Dr. Scott Halpern to mentor students, residents, post-doctoral fellows, and junior faculty in developing and testing behavioral economic interventions to prevent and improve outcomes following, acute and chronic respiratory failure. Patients with many forms of acute and chronic respiratory failure, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), respectively, are at high risk of death and suffer considerable short- and long-term impairments in quality of life and functioning. Behavioral interventions, including those informed by behavioral economic principles, hold great promise for preventing these conditions and improving outcomes. Yet the knowledge produced by randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of such interventions is limited due to impediments to patient accrual, patient-centered outcomes ascertainment, and the abilities of traditional analyses to determine which interventions work best for which patients. By leveraging the conceptual models, research infrastructures, and data collected in 5 of Dr. Halpern's ongoing or recently completed RCTs including 40,000 patients, Dr. Halpern and his mentees will develop and test ways to surmount each of these three barriers to producing greater knowledge on how to prevent and treat acute and chronic respiratory failure. First, they will conduct randomized trials of “nudges” to improve enrollment and retention in real RCTs. Second, they will learn and apply state-of-the-art natural language processing and machine learning techniques to enhance the ability to extract patient-centered outcomes from electronic health records, thereby identifying more efficient methods for outcome ascertainment in large, pragmatic RCTs. Third, they will learn and apply modern methods in causal inference and the detection of heterogeneous treatment effects to better understand how effective behavioral interventions are overall, how efficacious they would be if more patients adhered to them, and which interventions work best for which patients. These scientific aims will be completed within the context of a structured training program designed to improve Dr. Halpern's skills in mentoring junior patient-oriented researchers. Dr. Halpern has already successfully mentored more than two dozen patient-oriented researchers. However, by enabling him to reduce his clinical and administrative commitments, this award will increase the time he commits to mentoring, and will improve his mentoring skills by supporting didactic training in influence and leadership and “mentor-the-mentor” meetings with more senior mentors. The award will also enable him to develop a “Junior Faculty Visiting Professor Program in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine,” thereby enhancing opportunities for his and other established investigators' mentees to network with other leaders in the field, receive external feedback and mentorship, and gain the confidence that comes with speaking to less familiar audiences. NARRATIVE Randomized clinical trials of behavioral interventions are essential to the prevention and treatment of acute and chronic respiratory failure. However, the efficiency of such trials, defined as the knowledge gained divided by the costs of completing the trials, is often quite low due to impediments to patient accrual, patient-centered outcome ascertainment, and the abilities of traditional analytic approaches to determine which interventions work best for which patients. This mid-career investigator award in patient-oriented research will develop and test methods to surmount these three barriers in the context of a multifaceted training program that will make the Principal Investigator a more effective mentor and team leader.",Improving the efficiency of randomized trials of behavioral interventions for acute and chronic respiratory

"Optimizing anti-epileptic drug treatment in acute brain injury Project Summary/Abstract Dr. Zafar is a neurointensivist and clinical neurophysiologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital, whose goal is to become an independent investigator with expertise in comparative effectiveness research and pragmatic clinical trials using neurophysiologic tools, to improve outcomes in patients with acute brain injuries and seizures. Epileptiform abnormalities (seizures and seizure-like rhythmic patterns) are seen on electroencephalography (EEG) in up to 40% of acute brain injury patients and are associated with worse outcomes. Due to lack of evidence-based guidance, patients with epileptiform abnormalities are often aggressively treated with anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), exposing them to AED related adverse effects that may worsen outcomes. Dr. Zafar's preliminary data shows that increasing burden of epileptiform abnormalities in patients with hemorrhagic stroke is associated with worse outcomes. Up to half these patients receive AED treatment with no improvement in outcomes, and AED use itself is independently associated with worse outcomes. Dr. Zafar has built a comprehensive EEG database of 2000 patients to investigate AED effectiveness. In her career development plan, she will be using the rich neurophysiologic data in the EEG database, along with a nationwide dataset (Premier Healthcare Database) to study AED and EEG utilization patterns and AED effectiveness in a “real-clinical world” setting. Under the mentorship of Dr. M. Bradon Westover, and co-mentors (Dr. John Hsu, Dr. Elisabetta Patorno, and Dr. Hang Lee), Dr. Zafar proposes to: 1) Determine which specific epileptiform abnormalities show an acute response to AEDs by assessing neurological improvement within 24 hours of treatment (EEG database), 2) Assess the impact of AEDs on in- hospital clinical adverse outcomes and discharge functional outcomes in acute brain injury patients with epileptiform abnormalities (EEG database), 3) Investigate how AED-related adverse outcomes vary with practice patterns across hospitals with different resources and EEG utilization patterns (Premier Database). Dr. Zafar will perform a systematic exploration of the EEG database to determine EEG phenotypes associated with response to AED treatment, and determine the impact of AEDs on in-hospital adverse outcomes (e.g. mortality, hepatotoxicity, cardiac events). To account for national variation in AED prescription, hospital resources and EEG use, Dr. Zafar will examine adverse outcomes in the Premier Database. In addition to the proposed research, Dr. Zafar's career development plan includes a Masters of Science and coursework on analysis of large databases, pharmacoepidemiology and machine learning. Dr. Zafar will receive guidance from her mentors and advisors with diverse clinical and scientific expertise. The proposed training will allow Dr. Zafar to establish a niche in using neurophysiologic data in comparative effectiveness research and launch an independent research career aimed at improving neurologic outcomes in patients with acute brain injuries. Project Narrative Although patients admitted with brain injuries such as stroke and traumatic brain injury are at high risk for developing seizures, physicians have very limited information to guide anti-epileptic drug management in such patients. This results in frequent overuse of anti-epileptic mediations that are also known to have harmful side effects. Dr. Zafar's proposed project will significantly advance our knowledge on which patients benefit the most from treatment and which patients are at highest risk for harmful side effects, providing guidance for physicians in making treatment decisions that will improve outcomes in the thousands of brain injury patients admitted to US hospitals each year.",Optimizing anti-epileptic drug treatment in acute brain injury,10223451,K23NS114201,"['Antiepileptic Agents ', ' Anti-epileptic ', ' Antiepileptic Drugs ', ' Antiepileptics ', ' anti-epileptic agents ', ' anti-epileptic drugs ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Glasgow Coma Scale ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' General Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Neurological Models ', ' Neurologic Models ', ' mortality ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Patients ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' medication prescription ', ' prescribed medication ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Safety ', ' Seizures ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Time ', ' Adverse drug effect ', ' drug-related adverse effects ', ' Acute Brain Injuries ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Guidelines ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Pharmacoepidemiology ', ' Pharmaceutical Epidemiology ', ' drug epidemiology ', ' pharmacoepidemiologic ', ' pharmacoepidemiological ', ' Training ', ' Hepatotoxicity ', ' Hepatotoxic effect ', ' Liver Toxicity ', ' Toxic effect on liver cells ', ' hepatic toxicity ', ' hepatoxicity ', ' Rural ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Development Plans ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' brain damage ', ' brain-injured ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' hemorrhagic stroke ', ' Brain hemorrhage ', ' skills ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' Drug Exposure ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' disease subgroups ', ' disease subtype ', ' disorder subtype ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Master of Science ', ' Monitor ', ' Cardiac ', ' active comparator ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' Neurological outcome ', ' Neurologic outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' improved outcome ', ' Pragmatic clinical trial ', ' phenotypic data ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' stroke patient ', ' side effect ', ' Comparative Effectiveness Research ', ' comparative effectiveness study ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' ']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2021,200880,MA-08
"Risk prediction and optimizing outcomes to 1-year after firearm injury among children using emergency services in the US Proposed Approach: We will build three national cohorts of children requiring emergency services over a 10-year period to evaluate primary, secondary, and tertiary firearm injury prevention. We will use existing research infrastructure, data science methods, the ability to track children to one year, novel analytics, and an interdisciplinary team to address this critical public health need. Importance: Injury remains the leading cause of death in children, with firearms resulting in the highest mortality, surgical intervention, critical care, and cost compared to all other mechanisms of injury. However, there are many challenges to firearm injury prevention in children. Risk prediction tools are sparse, firearm injury recidivism and death are concerns among children who initially survive such an injury, and processes of care to optimize survival are under-investigated. There is a compelling need for research in these areas to facilitate targeted interventions to reduce firearm injury and mortality among at-risk children. Objectives: The proposal has 3 specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Using three national cohorts of children 0 to 17 years requiring emergency services, employ machine learning and geospatial analysis to develop and validate risk prediction models for firearm injury and short-term mortality using individual-, home-, incident-, and county-level factors. Specific Aim 2. Among children discharged alive following a firearm injury, measure injury recidivism, healthcare utilization, and mortality to 1-year and develop risk prediction models to identify children at-risk of adverse outcomes in the year after an index firearm event. Specific Aim 3: For children presenting to an ED after a firearm injury, identify ED and hospital characteristics independently associated with in-hospital, 30-day, and 1-year survival, and quantify the additional lives saved through feasible shifts in the location of initial emergency care. Study Design & Setting: We will build 3 cohorts of children using emergency services from 1/1/2012 to 12/31/2021 in 1,217 EDs in 8 states (ED cohort), 832 trauma centers in 50 states (Trauma Center cohort), and 5,461 EMS agencies in 28 states (EMS cohort). We will link six different data sources to the cohorts to capture longitudinal outcomes and 110 predictor variables at the patient-, incident-, home-, and county-level. Participants: Children 0–17 years using emergency services, including: 40.9 million in the ED cohort (n = 35,240 with firearm injuries), 620,007 in the Trauma Center cohort (n = 22,847 with firearm injuries), and 6.8 million in the EMS cohort (n = 14,314 with firearm injuries). Outcome measures: We will evaluate models for firearm injury, adverse events to 1-year among children initially surviving a firearm injury, and short- and long-term survival following a firearm injury. Project Narrative Reducing firearm injuries and related mortality in children is a critical public health priority. We will build three unique national cohorts of children injured by firearms and served by different aspects of the US emergency care system (emergency medical services, emergency departments, and trauma centers). Using these cohorts, novel analytic methods, and predictors at the patient-, home-, incident-, and county-levels, we will develop risk prediction models to: identify children at risk of firearm injuries (primary injury prevention); children at risk of adverse outcomes to one year after initially surviving a firearm injury (secondary injury prevention); and ED and hospital factors associated with optimal survival after firearm injury (tertiary injury prevention).",Risk prediction and optimizing outcomes to 1-year after firearm injury among children using emergency services in the US,10399358,R01HD108017,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Critical Care ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emergency medical service ', ' emergency service ', ' Firearms ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' indexing ', ' Investments ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' National Health Policy ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Societies ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' trauma centers ', ' Triage ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Caring ', ' injury prevention ', ' Accidental Injury ', ' Unintentional Injury ', ' Guidelines ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' Natural History ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Survivors ', ' Link ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' Monoclonal Antibody R24 ', ' MoAb R24 ', ' R-24 Monoclonal Antibody ', ' R24 ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Life ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' pediatric department ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' recidivism ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' NICHD ', "" National Institute of Children's Health and Human Development "", ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Emergency Care ', ' ED care ', ' ER care ', ' Emergency Department care ', ' Emergency Room care ', ' Emergency health care ', ' Emergency healthcare ', ' Emergency medical care ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' cost ', ' injured ', ' neglect ', ' care systems ', ' care services ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Childhood Injury ', ' injured child ', ' injured children ', ' injury in children ', ' pediatric injury ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' high risk ', ' public health priorities ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Data Science ', ' Gun injury ', ' firearm injury ', ' care costs ', ' emergency settings ', ' preventable death ', ' preventable mortality ', ' child services ', ' pediatric services ', ' Infrastructure ', ' risk prediction model ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' Home ', ' ']",NICHD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,1991980,OR-03
"Using Machine Learning for Early Recognition and Personalized Treatment of Acute Kidney Injury PROJECT SUMMARY Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in up to 20% of hospitalized patients and is associated with increased risk of readmission, morbidity, and mortality. The estimated annual cost of AKI care in the US is over 10 billion dollars, and, with the incidence rising, these costs will continue to increase. The current gold standards for diagnosing AKI, creatinine and urine output, are often delayed in their recognition of tubular injury. Prior work on AKI has typically focused on patients who have already developed AKI based on these standards, and interventions at this late time point have had mixed success. In contrast, emerging data suggest that intervening earlier can improve outcomes. Therefore, it is critical to optimize the early detection of AKI in hospitalized patients.  We have previously developed a machine learning tool to identify patients at high risk of severe (stage 2 or greater) AKI more than a day earlier than clinically apparent using structured electronic health record (EHR) data. Although more accurate than prior methods, it suffers from a high rate of false positives, which limits its value in clinical practice. There is a large amount of valuable information that is stored in unstructured free-text fields (e.g., clinical notes) that could be utilized using natural language processing (NLP) within advanced deep learning neural network models that could significantly improve the detection of early AKI. Furthermore, there are established and emerging kidney injury biomarkers that could be combined with EHR-based models to improve accuracy even further. Finally, it remains unclear what interventions will have the best chance of decreasing the risk for developing severe AKI in high-risk patients. A better understanding of which interventions are of greatest benefit to specific patients is critical for improving the outcomes of patients at risk of AKI.  The objective of this project is to develop novel tools to improve the identification and treatment of patients at high risk of AKI using a large, multicenter cohort. In Aim 1, we will use NLP and deep learning algorithms to develop a model to predict severe AKI across four health systems. In Aim 2, we will silently run the best- performing model developed in Aim 1 in real-time to identify high-risk patients. Manual retrospective chart review will be performed on a cohort of the highest risk patients to determine both the proportion of patients who receive guideline-based care as well as the association between receipt of guideline-based care and outcomes. We will also identify novel phenotypes of patients who are particularly helped or harmed by specific guideline-based interventions. Finally, in Aim 3, we will collect kidney injury biomarkers in the highest-risk patients to determine the added value of biomarkers to EHR-based models alone. Our proposal will provide clinicians with new tools to identify patients at risk of AKI earlier and more accurately. It will also provide evidence for which interventions are most likely to improve patient outcomes. This will result in earlier, more personalized care for patients at high risk of AKI, which will lead to decreased costs, morbidity, and mortality. PROJECT NARRATIVE Up to 20% of hospitalized patients develop acute kidney injury, which is associated with increased risk of readmission, morbidity, and mortality. This project will use advanced machine learning methods and biomarkers to improve the identification and treatment of patients at risk of acute kidney injury.

"A nanomagnetic platform technology to characterize traumatic brain injury using brain derived extracellular vesicles In the United States, 2.8 million people every year seek medical attention for traumatic brain injury (TBI), of which 80% are considered to have a mild TBI (i.e. concussion). Even in those with mild injuries, 10-20% of individuals will suffer long-term disability including seizures and emotional and behavioral issues. One of the primary challenges in TBI care is appropriately classifying this heterogeneous injury and identifying patients at risk for these chronic impairments. Conventional imaging studies, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), are commonly used to classify TBI, but do not reliably capture the full extent of the injury, particularly in those patients with mild injuries. Currently, there are few molecular markers to assist in the assessment of an individual's unique injury and subsequent recovery and biomarkers are desperately needed in the field that correlate with these varied endophenotypes, track the progress of the disease, and predict clinical outcomes. To address this challenge, we propose to develop a microchip-based platform that can be used to characterize TBI and its recovery using the RNA cargo found in brain-derived circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes. Unlike prior work that has mainly focused on single biomarkers, our approach measures a panel of circulating EV miRNA markers processed with machine learning algorithms, to more comprehensively capture the state of the injured and recovering brain. Our proposal combines surface marker-specific nanomagnetic isolation of brain-derived EVs from a variety of cell types, biomarker discovery using RNA sequencing, and machine learning processing of EV miRNA cargo to measure the state of injury and recovery in TBI. Nanoscale exosomes are known to shed from brain cells into the blood stream, carrying with them the molecular signatures that can be used to better diagnose and treat injuries, such as traumatic brain injury. We propose an innovative, clinically practical approach to probe the RNA contained within these nanoscale vesicles to better understand a patient's injury and recovery to better guide treatment. Our rapid and easily multiplexed platform has great potential for non-invasive diagnostics and monitoring of both secondary injury progression and drug efficacy, offers tremendous benefits for patients.",A nanomagnetic platform technology to characterize traumatic brain injury using brain derived extracellular vesicles,10261451,R33MH118170,"['Astrocytes ', ' Astrocytus ', ' Astroglia ', ' astrocytic glia ', ' Axon ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Volume ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Concussion ', ' Cerebral Concussion ', ' Commotio Cerebri ', ' concussion ', ' Calibration ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Color ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Inflammation ', ' Laboratories ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Nucleic Acids ', ' Patients ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Production ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Probes ', ' RNA Gene Probes ', ' Seizures ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Blinded ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Surface ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' prognostic ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' noninvasive diagnosis ', ' non-invasive diagnosis ', ' non-invasive diagnostic ', ' noninvasive diagnostic ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' brain damage ', ' brain-injured ', ' Vesicle ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Severities ', ' Stream ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' innovative technologies ', ' brain cell ', ' Performance ', ' drug efficacy ', ' tech development ', ' technology development ', ' Devices ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting -

"Translational Outcomes Project: Visualizing Syndromic Information and Outcomes for Neurotrauma (TOP-VISION) PROJECT SUMMARY: Trauma to the spinal cord and brain (neurotrauma) together impact over 2.5 million people per year in the US, with economic costs of $80 billion in healthcare and loss-of-productivity. Yet precise pathophysiological processes impacting recovery remain poorly understood. This lack of knowledge limits the reliability of therapeutic development in animal models and limits translation across species and into humans. Part of the problem is that neurotrauma is intrinsically complex, involving heterogeneous damage to the central nervous system (CNS), the most complex organ system in the body. This results in a multifarious CNS syndrome spanning across heterogeneous data sources and multiple scales of analysis. Multi-scale heterogeneity makes spinal cord injury (SCI) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) difficult to understand using traditional analytical approaches that focus on a single endpoint for testing therapeutic efficacy. Single endpoint-testing provides a narrow window into the complex system of changes that describe the holistic syndromes of SCI and TBI. In this sense, complex neurotrauma is fundamentally a problem that requires big- data analytics to evaluate reproducibility in basic discovery and cross-species translation. For the proposed TOP-VISION cooperative agreement we will: 1) integrate preclinical neurotrauma data on a large-scale; 2) develop novel applications of cutting-edge multidimensional analytics to make sense of complex neurotrauma data; and 3) validate bio-functional patterns in targeted big-data-to-bench experiments in multi-PI single center (UG3 phase), and multicenter (UH3 phase) studies. The goal of the proposed project is to develop an integrated workflow for preclinical discovery, reproducibility testing, and translational discovery both within and across neurotrauma types. Our team is well-positioned to execute this project given that with prior NIH funding we built one of the largest multicenter, multispecies repositories of neurotrauma data to-date, housing detailed multidimensional outcome data on nearly N=5000 preclinical subjects and over 20,000 curated variables. We will leverage these existing data resources and apply recent innovations from data science to render complex multidimensional endpoint data into robust syndromic patterns that can be visualized and explored by researchers and clinicians for discovery, hypothesis-generation and ultimately translational outcome testing. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Multicenter, multispecies central nervous system (spinal cord and brain) injury data provides a unique and clinically-relevant opportunity to discover translational outcomes, if we can develop analytical workflows that fully harness these data. Our team has assembled one of largest repositories of such data spanning across spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury models under prior NIH support. The proposed cooperative agreement will expand data-sharing and big-data analytical workflows to render raw neurotrauma data into novel insights to promote bench-to-bedside translation.",Translational Outcomes Project: Visualizing Syndromic Information and Outcomes for Neurotrauma (TOP-VISION),10199067,UH3NS106899,"['Affect ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Sources ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Housing ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Modernization ', ' Multiple Trauma ', ' Multiple Injuries ', ' polytrauma ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Rattus ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rat ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Spinal Cord ', ' Medulla Spinalis ', ' Spinal cord injury ', ' Spinal Cord Trauma ', ' Spinal Trauma ', ' Spinal cord injured ', ' Traumatic Myelopathy ', ' Spinal Injuries ', ' spine injury ', ' vertebral injury ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Outcome Assessment ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Funding ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' brain damage ', ' brain-injured ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Organ System ', ' body system ', ' success ', ' functional recovery ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' novel ', ' economic cost ', ' economic impact ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Nervous System Injuries ', ' Nervous System damage ', ' Neurological Damage ', ' Neurological Injury ', ' Neurological trauma ', ' neurotrauma ', ' Nervous System Trauma ', ' Modeling ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' Neuraxis ', ' therapeutic testing ', ' therapeutic evaluation ', ' Address ', ' Cooperative Agreements ', ' U-Series Cooperative Agreements ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' Detection ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' preclinical study ', ' pre-clinical study ', ' productivity loss ', ' cost ', ' biobehavior ', ' biobehavioral ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' data integration ', ' neuroinflammation ', ' neuroinflammatory ', ' Traumatic CNS injury ', ' CNS trauma ', ' central nervous system trauma ', ' traumatic central nervous system injury ', ' functional outcomes ', ' response to injury ', ' injury response ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' Trauma ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' bench to bedside ', ' bench bed side ', ' bench bedside ', ' bench to bed side ', ' bench to clinic ', ' therapeutic development ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' spinal cord and brain injury ', ' spinal cord & brain injury ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' Data Science ', ' biomarker discovery ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' FAIR principles ', ' FAIR data ', ' FAIR guiding principles ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable ', ' data resource ', ' Precision Health ', ' Big Data Methods ', ' Big Data Analytics ', ' Big Data Tools ', ' heterogenous data ', ' data heterogeneity ', ' data set heterogeneity ', ' dataset heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous data ', ' heterogeneous data sets ', ' heterogeneous datasets ', ' heterogenous data sets ', ' heterogenous datasets ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' Data Commons ', ' diverse data ', ' data diversity ', ' data curation ', ' Data Pooling ', ' data repository ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' ']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",UH3,2021,323000,CA-12
"A Systems Biology and Patient Stratification Approach to Improve Outcomes of Patients with Hypoxic Injury in Renal Tubular Cells in Chronic Kidney Diseases ABSTRACT  Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a global health epidemic and patients with CKD suffer from increased mortality and cardiovascular disease. Despite the severity of the disease, there are limited treatment options to hinder its progression. Tubular injury (TI) is a common finding on many kidney biopsies from patients with CKD, and there is mechanistic data supporting that TI can lead to interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy. While interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy are the strongest known pathologic predictor of progression of CKD, we have limited understand of how TI contributes to this progression. Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1α (HIF-1α) has been shown in animal studies to impact the severity of TI and is also known to trigger a fibrotic cascade, but there is limited data regarding its overall activity in kidney tissue, its cell type specific activity, its association with pathologic features or patient outcomes. It is of utmost importance to better understand this pathway as several Prolyl Hydroxylase inhibitors, which are novel therapeutic agents that increase the expression of HIF- 1α, are currently in clinical trial testing to treat anemia of CKD. The first aim of this proposal is to develop a measure of HIF-1α pathway activity that enables evaluation of clinical and morphologic features and cell-type specificity. Specifically, the candidate will a) Identify clinical and pathologic descriptors associated with increased HIF-1α pathway activity score and b) Determine the cell-type specific expression level of HIF-1α and its downstream components in tubular cells using single-cell RNA-sequencing. The second aim of this proposal is to determine the association of increased HIF-1α activity with outcomes and identify patients with increased HIF-1α activity non-invasively using biomarkers. Specifically, the candidate will a) Determine the association of increased HIF-1α activity score with patient outcomes and b) Identify serum or urine biomarkers that detect increased HIF-1α pathway activity in patients. The candidate will analyze data from 3 cohorts to accomplish these aims: Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE), Clinical Phenotyping Resource and Biobank Core (C-PROBE) and the Native Americans with Type 2 Diabetes cohort (formerly known as the Pima Indian cohort). These investigations will allow us to monitor HIF-1α activity non-invasively in trials where patients receive novel drug agents, such as Prolyl Hydroxylase Inhibitors.  The candidate will obtain formal training in analysis of gene expression data, single cell RNA- sequencing and machine learning techniques during the course of the award period to successfully integrate gene expression data, pathology data and clinical data. She will be mentored by an expert team with complementary experience in nephrology, tubular injury biology, systems biology and bioinformatics. The long-term goal of these investigations is to ultimately be able to better sub-type patients with tubular injury based on mechanistic terms. NARRATIVE Chronic Kidney Disease is a global health epidemic and is associated with increased mortality, but we do not have a detailed understanding of why this disease progresses. Identifying sub-types of patients who progress by the same molecular mechanism is important to identify patients for future clinical trials. This project aims to use gene expression data from kidney biopsies to identify patients who will respond differently to medications that increase the expression of Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1 alpha.",A

"Development and Validation of Computational Algorithms to Assess Kidney Health in Electronic Health Records Project Summary A key aim of this proposal is to equip the candidate, Dr.Ozrazgat Baslanti, with the necessary protected time and additional training and resources to develop her skillset on quantitative methods and understanding of underlying mechanism of progression of kidney disease and facilitate her transition to an independent translational researcher in health care. The long-term career goal is to become an independent data scientist, with a focus on hospital care for acute disease and complications arising from that care. The overall objective of this application is to build the foundation of the analytical approach for identifying patients’ health trajectories during episode of acute hospitalization and quantifying the transitions in health states that can be applied to any acute illness. Our central hypothesis is that using kidney health as a paradigm for this approach we can determine individual states of change in kidney health during hospitalization using longitudinal, highly granular temporal data in electronic health records, determine transition probabilities to more severe stages of acute and chronic kidney disease, and improve understanding of the underlying processes influencing these transitions. Current diagnosis and risk evaluation for acute kidney injury (AKI) are focused on determination of severity of AKI episode and an integrated framework for assessing renal recovery does not exist. There is a clear lack of research on estimating transition probabilities among different states of kidney health through nonlinear and non-normal time- dependent domains using longitudinal electronic health records data. The complexity of underlying processes influencing the transition probabilities from renal risk to more severe stages of acute and chronic kidney disease requires application of advanced computational models in sufficiently large and granular datasets. The specific aims of the proposal are: Aim 1- Expand and validate computable phenotypes of kidney health in large-scale medical data. Aim 2- Determine the epidemiology and clinical outcomes of changes in kidney health. Aim 3- Develop and validate probabilistic graphical models to predict transition through the states of kidney health and identify risk factors for progression. The proposed research is significant as we will have phenotyping algorithms of kidney health, validated in multi-center study, that can enhance their inter-institutional sharing and that enable to study epidemiology and outcomes of changes in kidney health. The approach is innovative because it implements technological advances in data science and statistics in innovative steps to develop and validate a phenotyping algorithm that determines computable phenotypes of changes in kidney health and graphical models to predict transition through the states of kidney health through nonlinear and non-normal time- dependent domains using highly granular electronic health records. This will provide foundation for changes in the care of patients with AKI, through identification of those patients at risk of developing AKI and progressing to acute and chronic kidney disease. On completion of the proposed investigations the deliverables will be new knowledge and a diagnosis and prognostication tool for kidney health. Project Narrative Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most common complication among hospitalized patients and is central to the subsequent development of chronic kidney disease and increased mortality. Besides the severity of an initial episode of acute kidney injury, the timing and duration of renal recovery are required to characterize the natural history of this complex condition and its effect on overall kidney health. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help to enhance health, since our research may provide diagnosis and prediction tools for changes in kidney health using electronic records data that contain wealth of clinical data that could be used to identify all dimensions of AKI episode as well as key determinants of undesired outcomes.",Development and Validation of Computational Algorithms to Assess Kidney Health in Electronic Health Records,10141224,K01DK120784,"['Acute Disease ', ' acute disease/disorder ', ' acute disorder ', ' Algorithms ', ' Award ', ' Complication ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Probability ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' Natural History ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' acute kidney injury ', ' Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis ', ' adjudicative process and procedure ', ' adjudication ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Modeling ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' therapy development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' prognostic tool ', ' inter-institutional ', ' Data Science ', ' improved outcome ', ' Preventive therapy ', ' Preventative therapy ', ' translational scientist ', ' translational investigator ', ' translational researcher ', ' Data Scientist ', ' Bayesian Network ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' acute care ', ' phenotyping algorithm ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' computable phenotypes ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' data repository ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,K01,2021,129110,FL-03
"Data-Driven Identification of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This K01 proposal will complete Michael Sjoding, MD, MSc's training towards his long-term career goal of improving care of patients with acute respiratory disease. Dr. Sjoding is a Pulmonary and Critical Physician at the University of Michigan with master's level training in clinical study design and biostatistics. This proposal builds on Dr. Sjoding's prior expertise, providing protected time for additional training in data science, the technical methods for deriving new knowledge about human disease from “Big Biomedical Data” in the rich training environment at the University of Michigan. The project's research goal is to develop real-time systems to improve accuracy and timeliness of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) diagnosis using electronic health record data. ARDS is a critical illness syndrome affecting 200,000 people each year with high mortality. Under-recognition of this syndrome is the key barrier to providing evidence-based care to patients with ARDS. The research will be completed under the guidance of primary mentor Theodore J. Iwashyna, MD, PhD and co-mentors Timothy P. Hofer, MD, MSc, and Kayvan Najarian, PhD, and a scientific advisory board with additional expertise in data science and applied clinical informatics. The 5-year plan includes didactic coursework, mentored research, and professional development activities, with defined milestones to ensure successful transition to independence. The mentored research has 2 specific Aims: Aim 1. Develop a novel system for identifying ARDS digital signatures in electronic health data to accurately identify patients meeting ARDS criteria. Aim 2. Define the early natural history of developing ARDS, to more accurately predict patients' future ARDS risk. Both Aims will utilize rigorous 2-part designs, with the ARDS diagnostic and prediction models developed in the same retrospective cohort and validated in temporally distinct cohorts. In completing these high-level aims, the research will leverage high-resolution electronic health record and beside-monitoring device data to study ARDS with unprecedented detail, providing new insights into ARDS epidemiology and early natural history. This work will build to at least two R01 proposals: (1) testing the impact of a real-time electronic health record- based ARDS diagnostic system to improve evidence-based care practice, (2) defining ARDS subtypes using deep clinical phenotypic data. The work will build toward a programmatic line of research using high-resolution electronic health data to improve understanding of critical illness and respiratory disease. In completing this proposal, Dr. Sjoding will acquire unique computational expertise in data science methods, complementing his previous training, which he can then readily apply to address other research challenges in respiratory health. The ambitious but feasible training and mentored research proposed during this K01 award will allow him to achieve his goal of becoming an independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a critical illness syndrome affecting 200,000 people each year in intensive care units with a 30% mortality rate. To improve ARDS care, new approaches are urgently needed to improve ARDS identification—the critical first step to ensuring patients receive life-saving treatments.

"(MEnD-AKI) Multicenter Implementation of an Electronic Decision Support System for Drug-associated AKI Abstract Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) in the US has increased by 38% over the last eight years, with drugs as a major contributor to AKI in hospitalized patients. Drug-associated AKI (D-AKI) results in severe consequences with approximately 40% of patients experiencing in-hospital death or dialysis dependence and 70% having evidence of residual kidney damage following the initial D-AKI event. We have determined that many patients at high risk for AKI are identified late and often continue to receive nephrotoxic drugs until AKI becomes severe. Thus, we designed a proposal to address the need for early, appropriate management of nephrotoxins in high-risk patients by studying the effect of an advanced clinical decision support system (CDSS) for primary physicians and hospitalists aimed at reducing D-AKI in hospitalized adults. Specifically, we aim to 1) optimize the clinical performance of D-AKI risk-alerts generated by a clinical decision support system; 2) test whether an advanced clinical decision support system coupled with a pharmacist-led intervention improves short and long- term outcomes for patients with D-AKI; and 3) determine physician perception of the pharmacists’ performance, physician acceptance and cost-effectiveness of our intervention. In 2012 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) published the first comprehensive AKI clinical practice guideline. Recommendations include the use of standard criteria for defining and staging AKI and a series of stage-based management steps to be considered for all patients with AKI or at risk for developing it. However, clinicians have been slow to adopt these recommendations and some groups (most notably the US KDOQI expert panel), while endorsing the guideline overall, have called for more research testing the recommendations. Our proposal directly addresses this concern by testing whether a unique clinical decision support system identifying high risk patients coupled with an advanced pharmacist service directed to the primary physician can address D-AKI and drug dosing for other forms of AKI to improve patient care. Thus, our central goal is to examine the effect of a pharmacist-led intervention on the early detection and management of AKI, progression of and short-term recovery from AKI, and on various AKI-related outcomes. Project Narrative Patients at high risk for acute kidney injury are often identified late and often do not receive recommended diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, with drugs being the most common cause; yet are potentially preventable. Clinical decision support to physicians in the form of automated alerts and pharmacist guidance for high-risk patients with drug-associated acute kidney injury (D-AKI) could dramatically improve risk assessment, medication use, and drug dosing in even non-drug-associated acute kidney injury. In this randomized control trial application, we will test whether adult hospitalized patients with D-AKI, cared for by physicians randomized to receive clinical decision support with an advanced pharmacist-led intervention, will have a lower risk for dialysis and premature death.",(MEnD-AKI) Multicenter Implementation of an Electronic Decision Support System for Drug-associated AKI,10209005,R01DK121730,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' assess cost ', ' cost assessment ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Dialysis ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Drug Modelings ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Laboratories ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Pharmacists ', ' Physicians ', ' Publishing ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Caring ', ' Injury to Kidney ', ' kidney injury ', ' renal injury ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Series ', ' Recovery ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Clinical Practice Guideline ', ' Staging ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' Dependence ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Services ', ' Medical center ', ' acute kidney injury ', ' Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Nephrotoxic ', ' kidney toxicity ', ' nephrotoxicity ', ' Hospitalists ', ' Reporting ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Decision Support Systems ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Predictive Value ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Update ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' post intervention ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' aging population ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' high risk ', ' control trial ', ' group intervention ', ' standard of care ', ' non-drug ', ' nondrug ', ' clinical risk ', ' Adverse drug event ', ' imaging agent ', ' equipment training ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' clinical decision support ', ' risk prediction model ', ' renal damage ', ' damage to kidney ', ' kidney damage ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' implementation intervention ', ' implementation cost ', ' implementation investment ', ' detection platform ', ' detection system ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,562198,PA-18
"Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Title: Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Project Summary:  Spinal cord injury (SCI) patients experience limited functional recovery, owing in part to the paucity of axon regrowth from injured CNS neurons. Effective treatments are lacking, likely because of multiple factors, intrinsic and extrinsic, that inhibit axon growth. Thus we require agents that target more than one source of regeneration failure.  Kinases are ubiquitous signal transducers that regulate most cellular processes, including axon growth. To begin to identify compounds that positively regulate axon growth, we screened 1600 small-molecule kinase inhibitors (KIs) in an in vitro CNS neurite outgrowth assay and identified “hit” KIs that reproducibly and strongly promote outgrowth. Due to homology of catalytic domains, KIs typically inhibit multiple kinases. This makes it difficult to identify the kinase(s) that mediate a KI's effects on cells. We used information theory and machine learning to analyze the inhibition profiles of KIs in relation to their effects on neurite outgrowth. This enabled us to identify, and later validate via siRNA knockdown in primary neurons, multiple kinase targets (i.e. kinases that should be inhibited to promote neurite outgrowth). These included previously known targets that regulate intrinsic and extrinsic inhibitor factors, in addition to several novel candidates. Conversely, we identified kinases whose activity is critical for neurite outgrowth, and whose inhibition must be avoided (anti-targets). We discovered several KIs that inhibit multiple targets and no anti-targets. These KIs strongly promoted neurite outgrowth in vitro.  We tested the KI, RO48, that had the largest effect in vitro in two in vivo models. Our preliminary experiments indicate that RO48 is remarkably effective in vivo. It promoted robust axonal growth of the corticospinal tract (CST) in three separate models of CST injury (pyramidotomy, funiculotomy, dorsal hemisection), and in the dorsal hemisection model, improved forelimb function. We propose to build on these remarkable results to test the working hypothesis that the simultaneous inhibition of RO48's five target kinases (ROCK, PKC, PRKG1, PRKX, and RPS6K) promotes sprouting and regeneration of CST axons. This will be accomplished using viral vectors to knock down expression of the different target kinases individually and in combination. We will do knockdown in CST neurons in the cortex. We will assess CST axon growth at the injury site using light microscopy. We will also perform experiments to determine if RO48-induced CST axon growth promotes axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and whether RO48 improves behavioral outcomes such as grasping and walking after a contusion injury.  These experiments will 1) validate novel kinases as in vivo targets for future development of SCI therapeutics 2) determine whether these kinases regulate CST axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and 3) confirm whether the substantial stimulation of axon growth induced by treatment with RO48 improves motor outcomes in a clinically relevant contusion model.  Title: Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Project Narrative: The proposed experiments aim to understand how small-molecule drug-like compounds increase the ability of nerve cells to grow long processes and re-form connections. Validating the molecular targets of these compounds for in vivo nerve growth will enable future drug discovery projects focused on these targets.",Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury,10160972,R01NS100531,"['inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Axon ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Complement 5a ', ' C5 a ', ' C5a ', ' Complement C5a ', ' Recombinant C5a ', ' Contusions ', ' Bruise ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Forelimb ', ' Future ', ' Gold ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' In Vitro ', ' Information Theory ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Microscopy ', ' Motor Cortex ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Nerve ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Phenotype ', ' Phosphotransferases ', ' Kinases ', ' Phosphotransferase Gene ', ' Transphosphorylases ', ' Rattus ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rat ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Natural regeneration ', ' Regeneration ', ' regenerate ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Spinal Cord ', ' Medulla Spinalis ', ' Spinal cord injury ', ' Spinal Cord Trauma ', ' Spinal Trauma ', ' Spinal cord injured ', ' Traumatic Myelopathy ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Transducers ', ' Walking ', ' Neurites ', ' Mediating ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Cervical ', ' Dorsal ', ' Distal ', ' Site ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' grasp ', ' Grips ', ' Lesion ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Confocal Microscopy ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Morphology ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' light microscopy ', ' Source ', ' Spinal ', ' experience ', ' axonal sprouting ', ' functional recovery ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' Catalytic Core ', ' Catalytic Region ', ' Catalytic Site ', ' Catalytic Subunit ', ' Catalytic Domain ', ' novel ', ' behavioral test ', ' behavior test ', ' Modeling ', ' drug discovery ', ' Corticospinal Tracts ', ' Short interfering RNA ', ' siRNA ', ' Small Interfering RNA ', ' kinase inhibitor ', ' CNS Injury ', ' injured CNS ', ' central nervous system injury ', ' Institution ', ' small molecule ', ' Dose ', ' Control Animal ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Motor ', ' in vivo ', ' in vivo Model ', ' Viral Vector ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' axon regeneration ', ' axonal regeneration ', ' axon growth ', ' axonal growth ', ' injured ', ' reconstruction ', ' knock-down ', ' knockdown ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Spinal cord injury patients ', ' SCI Patients ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' therapeutic target ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' regenerative ', ' screening ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' targeted agent ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,465464,FL-27
"Built Environment, Pedestrian Injuries and Deep Learning (BEPIDL) Study PROJECT SUMMARY Road traffic injuries are a major contributor to the burden of disease globally with nearly 1.3 million deaths globally and as many as 50 million injured annually with pedestrians and cyclists in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) among the most affected. Road infrastructure of the built environment (e.g., sidewalks), neighborhood design (e.g., street connectivity) and urban development (e.g., urban sprawl) are key determinants of the risk of pedestrian injuries. In LMICs, poor road infrastructure and neighborhood design are acknowledged as being important contributors to rising numbers of road traffic injuries and deaths, but there are few studies systematically identifying and quantifying what specific features of the built environment are contributing to motor vehicle collisions in these settings. Within LMIC cities, there are often large disparities where infrastructure is improved that reflect socioeconomic characteristics, leading to health inequities in road traffic injury. The paucity of georeferenced data on the built environment in LMICs has made research on road traffic injuries more difficult, though recent advances in computer vision and image analysis combined with Big Data of publicly available, georeferenced, images of roads worldwide (e.g., Google Street View, GSV) can help overcome the paucity of data and the cost and time limitations of collecting and analyzing data on the built environment in LMICs. Automated image analysis has largely been made possible via deep learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence and machine learning and relies on training neural networks to detect and label specific objects within images. These methods can drastically reduce the barriers to citywide built environment and traffic safety research in LMIC cities, thus substantially increasing research capacity and generalizability. My career goal is to become an independent investigator in global urban health with a focus on road safety and the built environment in LMICs. I propose undertaking research and training in deep learning methods applied to public health in the setting of Bogota, Colombia: 1) Develop neural networks to create a database of BE features of the road infrastructure from image data and to create neighborhood typologies from those features; 2) Assess the association between neighborhood-level BE features and typologies and pedestrian collisions and fatalities and road safety perceptions; 3) Assess the association of neighborhood social environment characteristics with pedestrian collision and fatalities, perceptions, and BE features and typologies. I am seeking additional training in 1) developing competency in deep learning methods applied to public health; 2) creating neighborhood indictors and typologies of health and the built environment; 3) applying Bayesian spatiotemporal models to understand how neighborhood characteristics and typologies influence health; 4) develop skills in multi-country collaboration, grant writing and overseeing research projects in LMICs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Roads and neighborhoods with a built environment that support safe and active transportation are a major priority in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) due to 90% of road traffic deaths occurring in these locations, especially to pedestrians and other vulnerable road users, yet data on key built environment features at a large scale are not always readily available in these settings. My career goal is to improve population health by examining the effects of the built environment and transportation on health through the adoption and use of methods that can leverage Big Data sources and answer complex, multilevel research questions by overcoming the lack of built environment data in LMICs. The proposed research uses deep learning and advanced statistical methods to create a citywide dataset of built and social environment features in Bogota, Colombia that will provide crucial data to answer questions of their impact on pedestrian injuries and deaths, as well as assessing the presence of health inequities in their distribution and that will lay the groundwork to expand these efforts to more cities in Latin America and other LMICs.","Built Environment, Pedestrian Injuries and Deep Learning (BEPIDL) Study",10453821,K01TW011782,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Cities ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Colombia ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Latin America ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Perception ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Typology ', ' Urban Developments ', ' Urban Health ', ' Writing ', ' Competence ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' career ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' computer imaging ', ' digital imaging ', ' experience ', ' computer science ', ' skills ', ' social ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' pedestrian injury ', ' cost ', ' injured ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' virtual ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Vehicle crash ', ' Automobile collision ', ' Automobile crash ', ' Car collision ', ' Car crash ', ' Motor vehicle collision ', ' Motor vehicle crash ', ' Vehicular collision ', ' Vehicular crash ', ' traffic collision ', ' traffic crash ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' high risk ', ' health inequalities ', ' Health Inequity ', ' Inequalities in Health ', ' Inequities in Health ', ' population health ', ' neighborhood association ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' built environment ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' LMIC ', ' deep learning ', ' Infrastructure ', ' neural network ', ' automated image analysis ', ' data infrastructure ', ' ']",FIC,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,K01,2021,83000,PA-03
"Targeting the B Cell Response to Treat Antibody-Mediated Rejection ABSTRACT Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) of solid organ transplants is the leading cause of immunologic graft injury, shortening the half-life of transplants and consequently of transplant recipients. This immunologically mediated process depends on B lymphocyte activation with differentiation to plasma cells (PC) that produce antibodies to the donor organ. Once established, antibodies have proven difficult to eradicate. Establishing an effective and safe way to treat patients with established AMR would potentially increase the half-life of transplanted organs, extend the lives of patients, and reduce the need for re-transplantation, ultimately increasing the number of patients who could receive life-saving organ transplants. Our lab has described an effective therapy in a non- human primate (NHP) sensitized model of kidney transplantation for lowering donor-specific antibody (DSA) and preventing injury from AMR. The treatment depends on PC depletion in combination with germinal center disorganization which together lower alloantibody levels. Dual targeting of the immune system by complementary drugs is based on NHP and human data using a proteasome inhibitor and belatacept. B cell activation and differentiation is inhibited at the same time that PC are depleted. Consequently, DSA declines, inflammation in the kidney resolves, and renal function stabilizes. The impact of this intervention on infection risk is not well defined but is anticipated to increase. We propose to measure the impact of therapy on both HLA-specific and pathogen-specific B memory cells and PC. We hypothesize that there is a hierarchy of susceptibility to therapy, with protective immunity being more resistant than allogeneic B cell memory. We will evaluate the impact of the regimen on T-cell function focusing on cytomegalovirus (CMV). Current therapy of late AMR using therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) and intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) with or without rituximab has shown variable results and frequent rebound of DSA. A low level of evidence supports the efficacy of these treatments, implying a tremendous need for well-conducted clinical trials to guide treatment of AMR. We propose a Phase I/II randomized, controlled, prospective interventional study of AMR in human kidney transplant patients using combined carfilzomib/belatacept (C/B) therapy with TPE and IVIG compared to TPE/IVIG alone. Outcomes will include the clinical impact of therapy on AMR using the recently validated iBox score for AMR assessment and the number and type of infections using standardized definitions of infection. We will measure the impact of therapy on HLA and pathogen-associated B memory and PC as well as CMV-specific polyfunctional T-cells. We will assess computational digital imaging analysis of AMR non-visual biopsy features to assess whether machine learning algorithms can improve on Banff criteria of AMR to better guide treatment and predict clinical outcome. Since late active and chronic active AMR have such a poor prognosis for kidney transplant patients, we believe that this trial is ethically justified and would potentially yield important safety and preliminary efficacy data that may lead to improved immune management of transplant patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE / PROJECT NARRATIVE End stage renal failure represents a massive health care problem for the United States, affecting 650,000 Americans every year, and having a mortality associated with dialysis of 65% within 5 years. $42 billion is spent annually for hemodialysis.

"Personalizing Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor and Angiotensin Receptor Blocker Therapy in Chronic Kidney Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are guideline- recommended therapies for preventing end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in patients with CKD. However, in real-world practice, ACEIs/ARBs are frequently discontinued by providers in the setting of acute kidney injury (AKI), rapid declines in kidney function, or advanced CKD. Premature discontinuation of ACEIs/ARBs can lead to adverse clinical outcomes among patients with CKD. However, discontinuation of these agents may be appropriate for certain CKD subgroups who are at higher risk of AKI and who may derive less benefit from these agents than trial populations. Although guidelines support the use of ACEIs/ARBs in patients with CKD, they also allow for individualization of decisions surrounding their use. However, it is unclear how to best individualize these decisions as CKD progresses to optimize kidney and cardiovascular outcomes. The overall objective of this proposal is to personalize ACEI/ARB therapy for patients with CKD based on each individual's risk factors for ESKD and CVD. To accomplish this, we will use data from the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study. We will first identify factors that drive the discontinuation of ACEIs/ARBs (Aim 1). Next, we will build two clinical tools that model the relationship between ACEI/ARB discontinuation and risk of ESKD (Aim 2) or CVD events (Aim 3) in individuals with CKD. Our long-term goal is to reduce the burden of kidney disease and improve patient outcomes by individualizing medication use in CKD. We expect that completion of these aims will result in the development of two prediction tools that can be further refined and implemented in real-world clinical practice as part of a career development award application. The proposed aims are integrated into a comprehensive training plan that includes a Master's Degree in Clinical Research and practical mentored experiences. Through this training plan, Dr. Chen will have the opportunity to 1) learn and apply knowledge in advanced biostatistical and epidemiological methods, including marginal structural modeling; 2) gain familiarity with the CRIC Study database, 3) apply machine learning algorithms to the development of clinical prediction tools, 4) refine skills in scientific writing and presenting research, and 5) advance towards a career development award and independence as a clinical investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been shown to prevent adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on a population level. However, ACEIs/ARBs are frequently discontinued despite guidelines recommending their use as first-line anti-hypertensive agents in CKD. This proposal aims to develop clinical tools that will predict whether individuals are likely to benefit versus be harmed by discontinuation of ACEIs/ARBs, with the goal of improving the safe and appropriate use of these agents in CKD.",Personalizing Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor and Angiotensin Receptor Blocker Therapy in Chronic Kidney Disease,10313873,F32DK130543,"['Age ', ' ages

"EEG and MRI Biomarkers to Predict Post-traumatic Epilepsy Project Summary Dr. Jennifer A. Kim is a critical care neurologist and neuroscientist at Yale-New Haven Hospital. Her long-term career goal is to become an independently funded translational investigator with expertise in signal processing of neurophysiologic and neuroimaging data to identify early biomarkers of secondary brain injury in critically ill patients, particularly related to post-traumatic epilepsy. Post-traumatic epilepsy is a disabling complication of traumatic brain injury (TBI). There is an urgent need to find biomarkers of post-traumatic epilepsy to identify patients at high risk for developing this complication. It is a population in which early biomarker identification could improve patient monitoring and ultimately treatment development to circumvent epileptogenesis. Post- traumatic epilepsy contributes to worsening of the already high rates of TBI morbidity, disability and cost of care, thus emphasizing the importance of preventing this complication. We need to find biomarkers to best define those most likely to benefit from potential treatments and make such treatment discovery trials more feasible. During the proposed training period, the candidate will expand upon her knowledge of EEG signal processing and machine learning techniques and acquire new skills in neuroimaging analysis using Magnetic Resonance technologies and biostatistics. To accomplish this, Dr. Kim has brought together a strong mentorship team of Dr. Hal Blumenfeld (primary mentor) and co-mentors Drs. Todd Constable, Brandon Westover and Brian Edlow who have expertise in multi-modal approaches to studying epilepsy, functional MRI analysis, computational EEG analysis and structural TBI imaging, respectively. Under their mentorship, Dr. Kim proposes to: 1) quantify epileptiform abnormality (EA) frequency and identify EA waveform features that optimally predict PTE, 2) determine if direct hippocampal injury, assessed by cortical thickness and contusion volume, stratifies PTE risk 3) assess whether indirect hippocampal injury, based on structural and functional MRI connectivity analyses, portend PTE. The overall goal is to identify early biomarkers of patients at high risk for post-traumatic epilepsy to target development of anti-epileptogenesis treatments. Bringing together advanced neurophysiologic and neuroimaging analysis and this strong mentorship support, this project opens new avenues for optimizing follow-up care and advancing potential treatment development for all traumatic brain injury patients at risk for post-traumatic epilepsy. This well-defined patient-oriented research proposal, in concert with the mentorship and structured didactic curriculum, will provide Dr. Kim with the skills that are essential to develop an independent career in neurophysiological and neuroimaging research that translates to improving patient outcomes. Project Narrative Post-traumatic epilepsy, a seizure disorder secondary to traumatic brain injury (TBI), is among the most disabling and difficult-to-treat complications of TBI. Currently, there are no tools to identify patients a priori at highest risk for PTE. Dr. Kim's proposed career development plan has great potential to advance our knowledge of the acute biomarkers of PTE using EEG and MRI, to improve early identification and ultimately provide treatment options for this potentially preventable complication.",EEG and MRI Biomarkers to Predict Post-traumatic Epilepsy,10192851,K23NS112596,"['Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Award ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Cognition ', ' Complication ', ' Contusions ', ' Bruise ', ' Critical Care ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Post-Traumatic Epilepsy ', ' Post-Traumatic Seizure Disorder ', ' Posttraumatic Epilepsy ', ' Posttraumatic Seizure Disorder ', ' Traumatic Epilepsy ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Predictors of Low-risk Phenotypes  after Traumatic Brain Injury Incorporating Proteomic Biomarker Signatures PROJECT SUMMARY Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death in the US, and treatment options are limited. Therapeutic clinical trials in TBI have yielded disappointing results owing in part to the difficulty in accounting for clinically important heterogeneity within TBI. Early delivery of therapy is essential after TBI to reduce secondary brain injury, but unrestricted treatment of all brain injuries could be harmful. TBI stimulates a complex cascade of immunologic responses, both centrally and peripherally. These peripheral immune responses to TBI could serve as an early sensor of risk phenotype given the rapid, readily measurable response in the blood. An improved ability to risk-stratify patients on admission will streamline patient selection for aggressive interventions—such as invasive neuromonitoring—versus selection of those patients who can safely be observed reducing potential harms. Holly E Hinson, MD MCR is a Neurologist and Neurointensivist at Oregon Health and Science University where she cares for patients with severe acute brain injury. The objective of this application is to develop supervised learning models of actionable short- and long-term outcomes post-TBI and to interrogate if pre-specified immunoregulatory proteins add predictive power to the models over clinical features alone. Her central hypothesis is that immunoregulatory proteomic signatures improve our ability to classify a low-risk clinical phenotype after TBI. Dr. Hinson’s preliminary data suggest peripheral cytokine levels are associated with actionable clinical events acutely after TBI. The project employs a highly-sensitive, single molecule immunoarray (SIMOA) to detect immunoregulatory proteins complemented with an unbiased proteomic approach utilizing global discovery mass spectrometry. She will develop and assess a series of models incorporating proteomic signatures to classify: acute progressive intracranial hemorrhage (Aim 1A), acute neurologic deterioration (Aim 1B), and long-term outcomes measured by the 6-month Glasgow Outcome Scale (Aim 2). She will develop these models in a well-defined, clinical trial population (development set), and test their ability to correctly classify outcome in an independent, prospectively enrolled cohort at OHSU (test set). Under a multidisciplinary team of expert mentors, the project will generate new insights into low-risk phenotype recognition and outcome classification after acute TBI. The proposed patient-oriented research project will be enhanced by a structured didactic program in the principles of predictive modeling and patient phenotyping (including proteomics), which will provide Dr. Hinson with the critical skills she will need to conduct independent, innovative translational clinical research in the field of neurotrauma. PROJECT NARRATIVE Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death in the US, and treatment options are limited—we lack methods to assess a patient’s risk of deterioration at admission. An improved ability to classify patients early after injury will allow us to identify those who may benefit from aggressive interventions versus those who can safely be observed. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and assess a series of predictive models incorporating immune proteins from peripheral blood to aid in the prediction of which patients are at low-risk for complications and poor outcome after TBI.",Predictors of Low-risk Phenotypes  after Traumatic Brain Injury Incorporating Proteomic Biomarker Signatures,10155597,K23NS110828,"['Accounting ', ' Age

"Identifying Resident and Immune Cell Injury Responses in the Human Kidney Kidney function, both under normal conditions and in the setting of injury or disease, is predominantly controlled by the amount, localization and activation state of proteins in specific cells at specific sites and under specific spatial influences that in turn regulate cell differentiation, division, metabolism, morphology, membrane polarization, secretion and transport. Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) takes advantage of laser ionization and time of flight mass spectrometry to simultaneously identify >40 metal ion-conjugated antibodies from tissue sections at 1micron resolution with essentially no background signal. By mixing cell specific antibodies and activation state-specific antibodies in the same cocktail, IMC produces a spatially preserved analysis of the location and activation state of multiple cell types from the same tissue section. We have developed a panel of 21 antibodies for simultaneous kidney section hybridization and IMC analysis, and a machine-learning based analysis pipeline that has allowed us to provide the first quantitative atlas of the number and location of the tubular, endothelial, glomerular and interstitial cells in the normal human kidney (Singh et al., JCI-Insight, in press). We now propose to validate an additional 22-29 antibodies for an expansion of this panel so as to provide information on the immune activation state and resident epithelial and endothelial cell injury, survival and death pathway responses predicted to be important in the injured human kidney. We will first perform in vitro validation of antibodies that detect cell injury/dedifferentiation states, survival pathways (autophagy, unfolded protein response, proliferation), and cell death/senescence pathways (apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, senescence, Specific Aim 1), as well as immune cell populations and their activation states (Specific Aim 2). We will then perform IMC/Kidney-MAPPS based validation of the composite panel using carefully characterized human kidney biopsies from patients with defined clinical insults and morphologically quantified tubular and endothelial injury (Specific Aim 3). The end product of this proposal will be to provide a validated set of antibodies that can be used to accurately quantify cell injury states and subsequent responses across a spectrum of human kidney diseases. These antibodies can then be used by investigators who perform multiplexed imaging of the kidney, including IMC, IONpath MIBI cytometry, Tissue Cytometry and Repeated Fluorescent Imaging to mechanistically interrogate human AKI. Acute Kidney Injury is an important cause of in-hospital morbidity and mortality. While we have a great understanding of the biological events in animal models of kidney injury, we have much less understanding of the events that cause human kidney Injury. This proposal is designed to develop the resources needed to study human kidney injury and thus inform better clinical trials of treatments to both prevent kidney injury and improve recovery.",Identifying Resident and Immune Cell Injury Responses in the Human Kidney,10145569,R21AG067335,"['Affect ', ' Antibodies ', ' Differentiation Antigens ', ' Differentation Markers ', ' Differentiation Markers ', ' Marker Antigens ', ' Atlases ', ' Autophagocytosis ', ' autophagy ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' B blood cells ', ' B cell ', ' B cells ', ' B-Cells ', ' B-cell ', ' Biopsy ', ' Cell Death ', ' necrocytosis ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Crystallization ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Dendritic Cells ', ' Veiled Cells ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Endothelium ', ' eosinophil ', ' Blood Eosinophil ', ' Eosinophilic Granulocyte ', ' Eosinophilic Leukocyte ', ' Marrow Eosinophil ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Exhibits ', ' Female ', ' Grant ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Ions ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' macrophage ', ' Mφ ', ' male ', ' mast cell ', ' Marrow Mast Cell ', ' Tissue Basophils ', ' mastocyte ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Metals ', ' Morbidity -

"Identifying Personalized Risk of Acute Kidney Injury with Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common and highly lethal health problem, affecting 10-15% of all hospitalized patients and >50% of patients in intensive care units (ICUs). It has been shown that a small increase in serum creatinine (SCr) of ≥0.5 mg/dl was associated with a 6.5-fold increase in the odds of death, a 3.5-day increase in length of stay, and nearly $7,500 in excess hospital costs. Unfortunately, no specific treatment exists to cure AKI once it has developed. The ability to predict AKI in hospitalized patients would provide clinicians the opportunity to modify care pathways and implement interventions, which could in turn prevent AKI and yield better outcomes. Although electronic medical record (EMR) based monitoring systems for AKI have led to expedited interventions and may increase the percentage of patients returning to baseline kidney function, most of these systems are reactive rather than proactive, with little or no contribution to AKI prevention. Moreover, our current knowledge of AKI risk factors is far from complete, especially in the ICU and general inpatient populations, characterized by numerous deficiencies and systematic failings that may be avoidable To transform the reactive AKI care to proactive and personalized care, early identification of high risk patients and better understanding of individual modifiable risk factors for AKI is the key. In Aim 1, to discover novel risk factors predictive of AKI, we propose to develop an ensemble multi-view feature selection framework to simultaneously consider the differences and interrelations between feature spaces and obtain robust knowledge by synthesizing findings from diverse patient populations across multiple institutions in nine US states. In Aim 2, to discover general modifiable causes of AKI to help physicians design more effective AKI prevention policies, we propose to develop a novel multi-cause inference method to identify causal relationships between modifiable factors and AKI for susceptible patient subgroups. In Aim 3, to explain what caused AKI in individual patients to support physicians in designing personalized AKI intervention, we propose to develop a new causal explanation method by integrating causal inference and case based reasoning to quantify patient-level causal significance of modifiable factors. The proposed study will have a significant clinical impact by not only expanding the capacity of clinicians to identify high risk patients for AKI early and advancing the general knowledge on causal and modifiable risk factors for AKI but also supporting personalized AKI intervention with suggestions on potential patient-specific actionable items. The work will not only advance AKI but also the machine learning and clinical research informatics community and the methodology developed is generalizable to other clinical domains. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is to identify clinical risk factors of acute kidney injury (AKI) in hospitalized patients from electronic medical records (EMRs) with machine learning. AKI risk factors discovered from EMR of diverse populations from multiple institutions across nine US states will be reliable and robust and can assist clinicians in providing proactive and personalized care to high-risk patients.",Identifying Personalized Risk of Acute Kidney Injury with Machine Learning,10200790,R01DK116986,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Creatinine ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Inpatients ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Learning ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Physiology ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Suggestion ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Hospital Mortality ', ' In-house Mortalities ', ' Inhospital Mortality ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Caring ', ' injury prevention ', ' Injury to Kidney ', ' kidney injury ', ' renal injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Hospitalization cost ', ' Link ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' acute kidney injury ', ' Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis ', ' Informatics ', ' Nephrotoxic ', ' kidney toxicity ', ' nephrotoxicity ', ' novel ', ' adjudicative process and procedure ', ' adjudication ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Early identification ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' US State ', ' Geographic state ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Monitor ', ' Myocardial ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Sepsis ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' case-based ', ' modifiable risk ', ' malleable risk ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' clinical risk ', ' clinical predictors ', ' personalized care ', ' Precision care ', ' individualized care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' individual patient ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' high dimensionality ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' heterogenous data ', ' data heterogeneity ', ' data set heterogeneity ', ' dataset heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous data ', ' heterogeneous data sets ', ' heterogeneous datasets ', ' heterogenous data sets ', ' heterogenous datasets ', ' feature selection ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,506211,KS-03
"Puberty, diabetes, and the kidneys, when eustress becomes distress PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT: Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a common and serious complication in youth with 2 diabetes (T2D). Epidemiological data implicate puberty as a major accelerator of kidney injury in youth with obesity and diabetes, yet the mechanisms by which reproductive maturation results in kidney disease remain unknown. A better understanding of the pubertal mechanisms contributing to kidney disease is needed to promote preservation of native kidney function, especially in high-risk youth with obesity and/or T2D. We hypothesize that youth with obesity and/or T2D experience relative kidney hypoxia during puberty due to a metabolic mismatch between increased renal energy expenditure and impaired substrate metabolism. In turn, the kidney hypoxia results in loss of glomerular charge and size selectivity with increased transglomerular transport of protein, and kidney dysfunction. To address these hypotheses, we propose to design an accelerated longitudinal study in which we will enroll adolescents (8-14 years, 50% girls) with obesity and elevated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c ≥6%) [n=60], and healthy normal weight controls [n=40] at Tanner (pubertal) stages 1-4 and examine them at baseline, 1 and 2-year follow-up. We will combine state-of- the-art magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods for quantifying kidney growth, oxygen availability and hemodynamic function with gold-standard measurements of glomerular filtration rate (iohexol clearance), renal plasma flow (p-aminohippurate clearance), glomerular size and charge selectivity (dextran and IgG/IgG4 clearance) and assessments of insulin sensitivity and mitochondrial function (intravenous glucose tolerance test and metabolomics). These experiments are designed to define the mechanisms contributing to kidney injury during puberty and identify novel risk factors and therapeutic targets to mitigate the development of obesity and diabetes-related nephropathy. Project Narrative: Youth-onset type 2 diabetes (T2D) typically manifests during or shortly after puberty and is characterized by a greater frequency and severity of diabetic kidney disease compared to adult-onset T2D and type 1 diabetes of similar duration. Puberty is recognized to accelerate kidney injury in youth with obesity and diabetes and may explain the magnified risk of diabetic kidney disease in youth-onset T2D, yet the pubertal mechanisms contributing to kidney injury in obesity and youth-onset T2D are unknown. The accelerated longitudinal study proposed in this application seeks to address these substantive gaps in knowledge.","Puberty, diabetes, and the kidneys, when eustress becomes

"Multi-modal imaging of the mechanisms underlying impaired executive attention after traumatic brain injury Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and long-term disability, and there are more than 5.3 million persons in the US alone with chronic executive attention and cognitive dysfunction. There is a funda- mental gap in knowledge of the functional and structural mechanisms underlying executive attention impair- ments after TBI. Without this knowledge it will not be possible to establish reliable ways to predict potential for recovery or, ultimately, create individualized therapies. The long-term goal of this integrated research effort is to identify the mechanism(s) underlying cognitive deficits in TBI patients, as this will enable accurate classifica- tion of their impairments, more accurate prognoses and precise evaluation of the effectiveness of interventions. The overall objective of this proposal is to relate clinically applicable EEG metrics of executive attention to quantitative metrics of structural connectivity alterations within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit (medial frontal cortex, striatum and central thalamus) and to evaluate their role in predicting cognitive outcomes after TBI. The central hypothesis is that individually measured electrophysiologic responses and anatomical injuries within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit of TBI subjects will correlate with executive attention deficits, as measured by the ANT, and accurately predict broad cognitive outcomes. This hypothesis is based on preliminary work from two studies of EEG and diffusion MRI in TBI patients, as well as related published research supporting the underly- ing model in more severely brain-injured subjects. The rationale underlying the proposed research is that char- acterizing the relationship between the anterior forebrain mesocircuit and executive attention deficits at an indi- vidual level, using both physiological and anatomical measurements, will allow insight into the biological un- derpinnings of the deficits and help frame mechanistic approaches to future diagnosis and therapy. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested with two specific aims. The first Aim is to determine the extent to which executive attentional impairment, measured with the ANT, relates to injury-related changes in the anterior forebrain mesocircuit a) physiology (EEG) and b) white matter connectivity (diffusion MRI). Part c) of Aim 1 will integrate the two modalities and relate them back to clinically-applicable EEG. {Aim 2 is to a) cross-sectionally relate and b) longitudinally predict cognitive outcomes via cutting-edge machine learning techniques applied to imaging metrics collected in Aim 1.} The approach is innovative, in the applicant's opin- ion, because they propose to link attentional impairments, as measured by the ANT, to measures of physiology and connectivity on an individual basis and predict cognitive outcomes {using machine learning.} The pro- posed research is significant, because knowledge of the biology underlying attention impairment will allow for its evaluation as a prognostic measure and provide targets for effective individualized interventions. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to enable development of therapies that can dramatically improve the quality of life for millions that remain unable to return to prior levels of functioning within their communities after TBI. The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the mechanisms underlying attention impairments after traumatic brain injury is ultimately expected to lead to the development of sensitive prognostic measures and individualized therapeutic interventions. Thus, the proposed work is relevant to the NINDS' mission in that it seeks fundamental knowledge about the brain in order to reduce the burden of neurological disease.",Multi-modal imaging of the

"AI driven acute renal replacement therapy - (AID-ART) Abstract Intradialytic hypotension (IDH) occurs in one-third of critically ill patients with acute kidney injury and treated with kidney replacement therapy in the intensive care unit (ICU). Occurrence of IDH is associated with increased resource utilization such as fluid and vasopressor administration, discontinuation of kidney replacement therapy, decreased recovery of kidney function, dependence on kidney replacement therapy and death. IDH is often unrecognized until it is well established, by which time patients are refractory to treatment or have already developed organ injury. Thus, if one could accurately predict who and when patients develop IDH, then effective preemptive treatments could be administered to reduce risk of IDH and improve outcomes. Our preliminary work showed that advanced high-frequency data modeling and waveform analysis identified patients at risk for hypotension within 2 minutes of monitoring in the ICU, and if monitored for 5 minutes, differentiated between patients who would develop hypotension or remain stable over the next 48 hours. In this proposal entitled “Artificial Intelligence Driven Acute Renal Replacement Therapy (AID-ART)”, we propose to apply predictive analytics using linked electronic health record and high-frequency monitor data to critically ill patients with acute kidney injury and undergoing intermittent and continuous kidney replacement therapies at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and the Mayo Clinic ICUs. We will examine the accuracy of various machine learning models to predict IDH risk-evaluating model performance, usability, alert frequency, lead time and number needed to alert, and hospital mortality and dependence on kidney replacement therapy (Aim 1a); predict response to a range of clinical interventions for IDH and subsequent clinical outcomes (Aim 1b); and perform cross validation across the two healthcare systems (Aim 1c). We will construct reinforcement learning systems to develop a rule-driven intervention for IDH alerts and measurement-driven responses to avoid and respond to IDH based on principles of functional hemodynamic monitoring (Aim 2a). We will also develop a reinforcement learning algorithm to learn an optimal intervention strategy based on the probability of events rather than in reaction to IDH events (Aim 2b). We will silently deploy and evaluate the ability of this artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm to forecast IDH risk and recommend interventions in real-time across the two healthcare systems. We will then assess the validity of recommended interventions using an expert clinician adjudication panel (Aim 3a); and will compare the AI recommended interventions with that of actual interventions performed by bedside clinicians (Aim 3b). This proposal will be the harbinger of a future multicenter randomized clinical trial to examine personalized risk prediction and AI-augmented management of IDH among critically ill patients with acute kidney injury and undergoing kidney replacement therapy in the intensive care unit. Project Narrative Among critically ill patients with acute kidney injury and treated with dialysis in the intensive care unit, if one could accurately predict early which patients will develop low blood pressure then effective treatments could be given. In this study, we propose to develop and validate an artificial intelligence system that will predict low blood pressure even before they occur and recommend correct treatment to clinicians.",AI driven acute renal replacement therapy - (AID-ART),10371943,R01DK131586,"['Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Dialysis ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Future ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypotension ', ' Low Blood Pressure ', ' Vascular Hypotensive Disorder ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Probability ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Hemorrhagic Shock ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Vasoconstrictor Agents ', ' Vasoactive Agonists ', ' Vasoconstrictor Drugs ', ' Vasoconstrictors ', ' Vasopressor Agents ', ' vasopressor ', ' Work ', ' Hospital Mortality ', ' In-house Mortalities ', ' Inhospital Mortality ', ' Titrations ', ' base ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Refractory ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Renal Replacement Therapy ', ' Kidney Replacement Therapy ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' Recovery ', ' Measurement ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Dependence ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Reaction ', ' System ', ' Hypovolemia ', ' Medical center ', ' acute kidney injury ', ' Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis ', ' Performance ', ' Expert Opinion ', ' Structure ', ' adjudicative process and procedure ', ' adjudication ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' adjudicate ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' usability ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' predicting response ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' improved outcome ', ' personalized risk prediction ', ' Individualized risk prediction ', ' augmented intelligence ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' learning algorithm ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' organ injury ', ' injury to organs ', ' effectiveness validation ', ' validate effectiveness ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' porcine model ', ' pig model ', ' piglet model ', ' swine model ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,639669,PA-18
"Harnessing Data Science to Promote Equity in Injury and Surgery for Africa PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Trauma and other surgically treated conditions are a crippling, unaddressed burden of disease that disproportionately impacts sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) globally. The Data Science Center for the Study of Surgery, Injury, and Equity in Africa (D-SINE-Africa) is a strategic partnership between the University of Buea (Buea), the University of California (Los Angeles (UCLA) and Berkeley), the Cameroonian Ministry of Public Health, the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences in Cameroon, and the University of Cape Town in South Africa. D-SINE Africa will address the intersection of health disparities with the risk factors and outcomes associated with injury and surgical disease in SSA. Although more abundant than ever, data is still a limited resource in low- and middle-income countries. Our approach views “big data” available in SSA as an opportunity to develop sustainable data-constrained approaches appropriate for resource-constrained settings. Thus, data science will be harnessed to address our Hub's two main goals which are;1) to decrease the burden of injuries and surgical diseases through improved surveillance, prevention, and treatment; and 2) to improve access to quality surgical care in Cameroon and other SSA countries. These goals will be achieved through three specific aims: 1) Research 2) Networking and 3) Capacity Building. These aims implemented through three cores (Administrative, Data Management and Analysis, and Capacity Building Cores) and two Research Projects that will be conducted in Cameroon, South Africa, and Uganda. Research Project 1 - Health Equity Surveillance addresses the urgent gap in rapid socioeconomic (SES) estimation necessary to track health equity in acute care settings by applying a clustering algorithm to existing publicly available Demographic and Health Surveys data sets for SSA. Research Project 2 – Trauma Follow Up Prediction aims to improve trauma outcomes by using machine learning to optimize a mobile phone-based screening survey that will identify which trauma patients would benefit from further care after they are discharged from the hospital, again using a data reduction “big data to small data” approach in line with the Hub's commitment to sustainable data use practices. These projects utilize common data sources (Cameroon Trauma Registry), have harmonizing themes (injury, equity, and data reduction), and will yield findings that can be used together (e.g., identification of SES groups vulnerable to poor follow up care). The Hub has innovatively built community engagement vehicles into the Internal Advisory Board to promote a multi-faceted approach to building trust with research participants and end-users. D-SINE Africa efforts will drive innovation and impact in data science, injury, and equity research to improve access to surgical disease prevention and care, including those whose SES conspires to increase their vulnerability to injury and surgical conditions while reducing consistent surgical care access. D-SINE Africa's strategic partners joint infrastructure are available for use by its members and DSI-Africa consortium at large. PROJECT NARRATIVE Injuries and other surgically treated diseases comprise a significant burden of disease in Cameroon and other sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries with deep inequities that are particularly unmasked in acute care settings. D-SINE Africa Hub will focus on the intersection between injury and equity, leveraging data science to decrease the impact of trauma, surgical disease, and disparities on the population of Cameroon and SSA by promoting collaborative research, networking, and capacity building with an emphasis on equity.",Harnessing Data Science to Promote Equity in Injury and Surgery for Africa,10314099,U54TW012087,"['Africa ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Algorithms ', ' California ', ' Cameroon ', ' Communities ', ' Congo ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Hospital Referrals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Housing ', ' Institutes ', ' Joints ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Seeds ', ' Plant Embryos ', ' Plant Zygotes ', ' seed ', ' South Africa ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Uganda ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' Trust ', ' African ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Demographic and Health Surveys ', ' data quality ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Country ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' meetings ', ' data management ', ' SINEs ', ' Short Interspersed DNA Sequence Elements ', ' Short Interspersed Element ', ' Short Interspersed Nucleotide Elements ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' prevention service ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Research Training ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Office of Administrative Management ', ' Administrative Management ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' implementation science ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' health equity ', ' Secure ', ' data reduction ', ' injury burden ', ' screening ', ' mathematical sciences ', ' math sciences ', ' mathematic sciences ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' Trauma patient ', ' Data Science ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' LMIC ', ' treatment services ', ' Disease Surveillance ', ' Infrastructure ', ' advanced analytics ', ' acute care ', ' disease disparity ', ' community engagement ', ' ']",FIC,UNIVERSITY OF BUEA,U54,2021,1298341,
"Molecular characterization of pulmonary edema: a window to an injured lung Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a heterogeneous, life-threatening condition defined by poor oxygenation and bilateral pulmonary edema that carries a mortality rate >40% in most studies. Every ARDS drug trial to date has failed, perhaps because the clinical criteria defining ARDS include a substantial subset of low-risk patients. Clinical scoring systems poorly predict which ARDS patients will develop prolonged respiratory failure and are at increased risk of death.  Molecular profiling of pulmonary edema fluid could serve as a window on the alveolar microenvironment, enabling identification of high-risk patients. Pulmonary edema directly reflects lung pathobiology including loss of barrier integrity, inflammation, and epithelial damage. Unfortunately, free-flowing pulmonary edema has limited clinical utility because it can only be captured in a minority of patients. Molecular characterization of pulmonary edema is now possible in every patient with ARDS because of two critical innovations. First, we discovered that edema fluid condensing in the HME (heat and moisture exchanger) filter of the ventilator circuit, usually discarded as trash, closely reflects free-flowing edema. Second, we developed a non-targeted metabolomic fingerprinting method using mass spectroscopy that characterizes molecular components in trace quantities of fluid. Together, these innovations make it possible to test the central hypothesis that molecular features of edema fluid reflect pathobiology and enable ARDS risk stratification.  To address the prognostic enrichment potential of HME edema fluid, 300 early ARDS patients will be recruited at 3 US centers, with protocolized HME edema fluid collection. Aim 1 is to study whether high HME edema fluid total protein and lung-injury specific proteins predict prolonged respiratory failure ≥48h in ARDS. Aim 2 is to test whether hypermetabolic edema fluid and inflammatory lipids predict prolonged respiratory failure ≥48h in ARDS. In Aim 3, LASSO machine learning will be used to integrate all proteomic and metabolomic edema features into a prolonged mechanical ventilation classifier. The robustness of the classifier will be assessed by measuring whether it adds prognostic value to clinical ARDS severity scores, identifying how well key molecular features are reflected in plasma, and testing for replication in an independent cohort.  The goal of these studies is to examine to what extent a novel and readily available lung-specific sample, obtained early in the course of ARDS, reflects biology and can predict ARDS outcomes, thus offering prognostic enrichment for future clinical trials. Successful completion of the Specific Aims offers the potential for a much-needed classification scheme to better refine, understand, and therapeutically-target ARDS. PROJECT NARRATIVE Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a common, life-threatening condition with no approved drug treatments. Pulmonary edema is a cardinal feature of ARDS and is mirrored closely by edema fluid collected passively in the Heat Moisture Exchanger (HME) filter; thus HME filter edema provides a novel and completely non-invasive window to the alveolar microenvironment. This proposal seeks to understand whether molecular characteristics of HME filter edema predict prolonged respiratory failure and could facilitate enrollment of high-risk patients into ARDS clinical trials.",Molecular characterization of pulmonary edema: a window to an injured lung,10231005,R01HL152083,"['Biology ', ' Bronchoscopy ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Edema ', ' Dropsy ', ' Hydrops ', ' Electrons ', ' Negative Beta Particle ', ' Negatrons ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Inflammation ', ' Lipids ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Proteins ', ' Pulmonary Edema ', ' lung edema ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' ARDS ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' Adult ARDS ', ' Adult RDS ', ' Da Nang Lung ', ' Shock Lung ', ' Stiff lung ', ' wet lung ', ' Risk ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Measures ', ' Intensive Care ', ' Ventilator ', ' receptor for advanced glycation endproducts ', ' AGE receptor ', ' RAGE receptor ', ' advanced glycosylation end product receptor ', ' amphoterin receptor ', ' receptor for AGE ', ' receptor for advanced glycation end product ', ' receptor of AGE ', ' Mechanical ventilation ', ' mechanical respiratory assist ', ' mechanically ventilated ', ' Clinical ', ' prognostic ', ' Epithelial ', ' alveolar epithelium ', ' Lung Alveolar Epithelia ', ' peripheral blood ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Bilateral ', ' Sample Size ', ' lung injury ', ' Lung damage ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Inflammatory ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Hour ', ' Severities ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' ionization ', ' cohort ', ' Informatics ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Proteomics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' lung failure ', ' pulmonary failure ', ' Respiratory Failure ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Alveolar ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' molecular profile ', ' molecular signature ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Classification Scheme ', ' Collection ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' protein metabolite ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' therapeutic target ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' treatment strategy ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' prognostic value ', ' prognostic ability ', ' prognostic power ', ' prognostic utility ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' recruit ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' systemic inflammatory response ', ' systemic inflammation ', ' epithelial injury ', ' ']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,539888,CA-18
"Machine learning to inform health services and policy for traumatic brain injury Project Summary Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is recognized as the leading cause of death and disability in all parts of the world and costs the international economy approximately US$400 billion annually, which, given an estimated standardized gross world product of US $73.7 trillion, is a striking 0.5% of the entire annual global output. To address the profound issues related to a drastic increase in emergency department visits and hospitalizations for TBI over the past decades, the United States Congress highlighted injury surveillance as a federal priority. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines surveillance as “use of health-related data that precede diagnosis and signal a sufficient probability of a case or an outbreak to warrant further public health response”. To prevent TBI, it is essential to understand its distribution and patterns, in addition to having strong knowledge of clinical disorders, characteristic, or other definable entity, that differentiates TBI from other clinical populations. A critical barrier to the progress of the NIH-funded program “Comorbidity in traumatic brain injury and risk of all-cause mortality, functional and financial burden: a decade-long population based cohort study” was the presence of complex and multifaceted comorbidities in a patient with TBI before and at the time of the injury, and their links to patients’ frailty, injury circumstances, severity, and outcomes. This resulted in a shift in the research paradigm, and development of a novel data mining approach used in genomics to sequence more than 70,000 clinical diagnosis codes in a TBI population, and compare them to a matched population. The developed data mining approach allowed not only the validation of previously known risk factors of TBI, but also the identification of associations previously unknown, without any preconceived human biases. This project will continue advancement of a non-hypothesis driven scientific approach, which will: (1) Characterize patients with TBI at three different time periods in relation to the TBI event – before, at the time of, and after the injury; (2) Develop individual and population level models to study the transitions between the different time states; and (3) Construct and validate predictive models of susceptibility to TBI events, adverse outcomes, and high healthcare resource use at the individual and population level. Decades- long population-based health administrative data from the publicly-funded healthcare system in Ontario, Canada is ready to be further analysed for clinical and technological advancement, to support human thinking in categorizing personal, clinical, and environmental exposure data preceding TBI. Project Narrative To detect, manage, and prevent traumatic brain injury (TBI), a complex and often lifelong disabling injury, it is essential to understand its distribution and patterns and have a comprehensive knowledge of the clinical disorder, characteristic, or other definable entity that differentiates between and within persons at risk of TBI of varying mechanisms, injury presentation, and its course. This research proposal expands an ongoing NIH-funded project that started to categorize clinical comorbidities and personal and environmental exposure data into clinically meaningful factors that increase the risk of injury and its severity at the population and individual levels. With the support of data mining and big data, this proposed program will advance research methods with a goal-directed learning process and the fields of injury surveillance and precision medicine, covering a variety of interests in public health, brain injury medicine, and behavioural and social sciences.",Machine learning to inform health services and policy for traumatic brain

"Integrated proteomic and metabolomics analysis of thrombotic myocardial infarction Project Summary / Abstract: Acute myocardial infarction (MI) is defined as myocardial ischemia, the inadequate supply of blood to heart muscle, followed by myocardial cell death. Multiple causes of acute MI are widely recognized and can be categorized as thrombotic, non-thrombotic, and acute MI secondary to coronary procedures. The mechanistic cause of a thrombotic MI is the rupture or erosion of an atherosclerotic plaque that results in the formation of a thrombus, or blood clot, which occludes the flow of blood. In contrast, non-thrombotic MI occurs secondary to mechanisms which create an oxygen supply and demand imbalance, but are not associated with atherosclerotic plaque rupture or disruption. Given that myocardial cell death is the pathological characteristic that is common to all acute MI, non-invasive diagnostics for acute MI are based on the detection of myocardial cell death. Currently non-invasive diagnostics for differentiating thrombotic MI from non-thrombotic MI do not exist which results in sub-optimal treatment and diminished patient safety. Further, it is not known how the impacts on metabolism and biological processes differ between thrombotic and non-thrombotic MI. In this project, we will address both of these problems. We will develop a diagnostic method for the non-invasive differentiation of thrombotic MI versus non-thrombotic MI that will enable earlier, safer, and more precise targeting of therapeutics to patients suffering from acute MI. We will determine biological processes that differ between thrombotic and non-thrombotic MI, which will suggest targets for therapeutic intervention that are specific to the underlying cause of an acute MI. In Aim 1 we will utilize high resolution mass spectrometry to determine the absolute concentration of over 500 proteins in previously collected plasma samples from human subjects who were experiencing an acute MI for which the cause (thrombotic versus non-thrombotic) was determined. This will enable us to determine which proteins report on the cause of the acute MI as opposed to the presence of myocardial cell death. A critical advantage of our study design is that we have repeated measures from the same human subjects: at the time of presentation, 6 hours post-presentation, and at a stable event-free follow-up timepoint 3 months after the acute MI. In Aim 2 we will integrate this data with our existing data on the abundances of metabolites and lipids generated from the same human subject samples. This integrated data will facilitate an in-depth analysis of the differences between thrombotic and non-thrombotic MI in the activities of metabolic pathways, receptor-ligand binding events, and other biochemical reactions. Further we will conduct data- dependent systems biology analyses that will highlight proteins, metabolites, and lipids that are co-abundant in plasma and will evaluate how the topology of these related entities differs between thrombotic and non- thrombotic MI. In Aim 3 we will develop a statistical classifier for the determination of the underlying cause of an acute MI. We will conduct a blinded evaluation of the performance of this classifier in a second cohort. Project Narrative: Acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) is one of the leading causes of death in the United States and globally. Currently a non-invasive method of determining the underlying cause of an acute myocardial infarction does not exist, and it is unknown how different causes of acute myocardial infarction affect or alter metabolic processes. This project will use previously collected blood plasma from humans experiencing an acute myocardial infarction to develop a diagnostic method for determining the underlying cause of the event and how the different causes alter metabolic processes.",Integrated proteomic and metabolomics analysis of thrombotic myocardial infarction,10087409,SC1GM139730,"['Affect ', ' Blood coagulation ', ' Blood

"A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This application, “A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers,” is in response to PAR-16-238, Dissemination and Implementation Research in Health (R01). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has high prevalence (10% of intensive care unit admissions) and mortality up to 46%. Low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV) is the most effective therapy for ARDS, lowering mortality by 20-25%, and is part of standard practice. However, use of LTVV is as low as 19% of ARDS patients. There is a poor understanding of the barriers to LTVV adoption: current approaches are deficient because they incorporate biases, lack consistency and comprehensiveness, ignore the influence of interpersonal network- or team- based factors, and do not address setting-specific variation. Our research team has previously identified some patient- and clinician-specific facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption. We have used two state-of-the-art data driven methods—data science and network analysis—to preliminarily quantify the impact of a diverse array of potential factors affecting LTVV adoption, including network- and team-based factors. The proposed research is guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations theory. The overall goals of the proposed research are to understand the differences in facilitators and barriers to LTVV adoption between academic and community settings through a definitive, systematic study in a large, diverse consortium of medical centers, and to advance implementation science by providing a model for how data science and network analysis can be applied to understand the adoption of a complex intervention. The overarching hypothesis is that there are different patient-, clinician-, network-, and team-based facilitators and barriers to LTVV adoption in academic and community settings. We will determine whether different patient- and clinician- (Aim 1 cohort study, clinician survey, and data science analysis), clinician interpersonal network- (Aim 2 network analysis), and team structure and dynamics-based (Aim 3 team construction and modeling) facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption exist between academic and community hospital settings. Successful completion of the proposed research will provide a comprehensive understanding of the differences in the facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption between academic and community settings, and will advance implementation science by serving as a model of how data science and network analysis can be applied to complex implementation problems. Implementation strategies that account for all these factors may be more likely to lead to significant practice change. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has high prevalence and mortality among critically ill patients; low tidal volume ventilation is the most effective therapy for ARDS but is used infrequently. Successful completion of the proposed research will identify differences in the facilitators of and barriers to adoption of low tidal volume ventilation between academic and community hospital settings in a large and diverse consortium of medical centers. The proposed research will generate a model of how data science and network analysis can be used to understand the implementation of a complex evidence-based practice.",A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers,10178076,R01HL140362,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Attitude ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Diffusion of Innovation ', ' Environment ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Professional Organizations ', ' professional association ', ' professional membership ', ' professional society ', ' Pulmonary Edema ', ' lung edema ', ' Research ', ' Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' ARDS ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' Adult ARDS ', ' Adult RDS ', ' Da Nang Lung ', ' Shock Lung ', ' Stiff lung ', ' wet lung ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Tidal Volume ', ' respiratory airway volume ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Acute ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' lung injury ', ' Lung damage ', ' Inflammatory ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Height ', ' respiratory ', ' Medical center ', ' Performance ', ' computer science ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' hypoxemic ', ' Hypoxemia ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' International ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Characteristics ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' implementation research ', ' dissemination research ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' implementation science ', ' community setting ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' Data Science ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' implementation strategy ', ' strategies for implementation ', ' complex data ', ' ventilation ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research ', ' Consolidated Framework for Implementation Science ', ' Consolidated Framework for Implementing Change ', ' ']",NHLBI,NORTHSHORE UNIVERSITY HEALTHSYSTEM,R01,2021,680901,IL-09
"Timeliness of Management of Trauma Related Hemorrhage and Trauma Related Coagulopathy PROJECT SUMMARY Injury is the most common cause of death in people younger than 46 years of age, and bleeding after injury is the most common cause of preventable death. Treatment of bleeding requires timely procedures to stop the bleeding as well as medications and blood transfusions to prevent blood thinning. Hospitals that specialize in treating injury have protocols, medications, devices and clinical staff available 24 hours a day and seven days a week. Injured people treated at specialized hospitals are more likely to live. However, there are far too many injured people every year than can be treated at specialized hospitals so minor injuries are cared for at hospitals not specialized in treating injuries. Severely injured people are taken to hospitals not specialized in treating injuries when specialized hospitals are too far away, or the emergency medical personnel underestimate how seriously injured someone is. Hospitals not specialized in treating injuries do not participate in ongoing injury clinical trials, regional data registries nor national quality improvement programs, and as a result what happens there that leads to people bleeding to death is unknown. This application's long-term objective is to improve the timeliness of treatment of bleeding after injury. The Specific Aims will be to: 1) understand how bleeding after injury is managed in hospitals that do and do not specialize in treating injuries; 2) identify the reasons patients do not get timely treatment; and3) determine how to improve the timeliness of treatment. The central hypothesis is that treatment of bleeding is not standardized in hospitals not specialized in treating injuries and leads to a delay in transferring injured people to specialized hospitals. Identifying modifiable healthcare system, hospital, and patient factors can inform the design of a systematic process to quickly temporarily stabalize bleeding of injured people initially at non-specialized centers then expedite transfer to specialized hospitals by engaging key stakeholders from across the spectrum of hospitals. This will ensure that people who are bleeding after injury are cared for at the right place at the right time. Ultimately, the right treatment at the right time will give people initially taken to hospitals not specialized in treating injuries the same chance at life as those taken to specialized hospitals. As a Career Development Award, the proposed training plan will include training in data science, systems engineering and design. The methods to be learned and employed will be machine learning, failure mode, effects and criticality analysis and user-centered design. The health relatedness of the project is to understand current practice management of bleeding after injury, in order to improve the timeliness of bleeding treatments to enhance the health of injured inviduals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Injury is the most common cause of death in people under 46 years old with more than 200,000 Americans dying annually. Bleeding accounts for 30% of deaths after injury, most of which are preventable if patients receive timely bleeding treatments including procedures to stop the bleeding as well as medications and blood transfusions to prevent blood thinning. The proposed resarch will understand how bleeding after injury is managed in hospitals that do and do not specialize in injury care, identify the reasons patients do not get timely treatment, and then create an improved systematic process by engaging key stakeholders from across the spectrum of hospitals caring for injured people.",Timeliness of Management of Trauma Related Hemorrhage and Trauma Related Coagulopathy,10203288,K23HL157832,"['Algorithms ', ' Bleeding time procedure ', ' Bleeding Time ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Coagulation Disorders ', ' Coagulation Disorder ', ' Coagulopathy ', ' bleeding disorder ', ' clotting disorder ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Blood Transfusion ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Chicago ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Emergency medical service ', ' emergency service ', ' Emergency Medical Technicians ', ' Emergency Medicine Technicians ', ' Emergency Paramedics ', ' emergency medical personnel ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Hemostatic Agents ', ' Hemostatics ', ' Hospitals ', ' Special Hospitals ', ' Illinois ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Minor ', ' mortality ', ' Patient Transfer ', ' Patients ', ' Interventional radiology ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resuscitation ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Time ', ' trauma centers ', ' Triage ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Time Management ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' blood product ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' American ', ' Practice Management ', ' Devices ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Adherence ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' American College of Surgeons ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' injured ', ' time use ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Trauma ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' user centered design ', ' engineering design ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' standardized care ', ' data registry ', ' trauma care ', ' Patient Triage ', ' Trauma patient ', ' Data Science ', ' Traumatic injury ', ' preventable death ', ' preventable mortality ', ' stroke patient ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' severe injury ', ' critical injury ', ' devastating injury ', ' ']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K23,2021,190279,IL-07
"Advancing Secondary Data Analysis: the ENIGMA Brain Injury Data Harmonization Initiative Project Summary/Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major public health issue globally, and while neuroimaging has been useful in understanding disruption in brain structure and function after injury, there are a number of factors that attenuate its prognostic ability. For example, there is tremendous heterogeneity in outcome after injury which is only partially explained by injury severity. Cost frequently limits sample size in neuroimaging studies, yet given the myriad factors that have been shown to influence patient outcome (age, injury severity, socioeconomic status), small samples and mass univariate testing often result in many studies being grossly under-powered. One solution is to combine data and create novel data sharing platforms, and the Enhancing Neuroimaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) consortium has supported this kind of collaboration for over a decade across a range of clinical disorders. The goal of this proposal is to develop tools and data processing procedures for use in the ENIGMA Brain Injury working group. In the R61 phase, we aim to develop and test a workflow for harmonized processing of behavioral data (Aim 1) as well as structural and functional (resting-state) MRI data (Aim 2). For Aim 1 of the R61, the goal is to offer a decision tree of procedures that is data-dependent, allowing investigators to establish common cognitive endpoints across cohorts that collect a range of neuropsychological and clinical measures. This proposal will create sharable procedures, flexible tools, and generalizable guidelines for best practices for extracting common cognitive endpoints from distinct behavioral test batteries (R61 Aim 1). In Aim 2 of the R61, we develop an image processing pipeline called Harmonization and Aggregation for Functional and structural imaging data PIPEline; HAF-PIPE) that allows for aggregation of non-equivalent imaging data. A primary goal is to decentralize ComBat, an open-source data harmonization tool, so that it can be used in a virtual sharing environment. Following satisfaction of the R61 Go/No-Go criteria, which is the curation of the dataset including 13 cohorts, extraction of common cognitive endpoints, and creation of HAF- PIPE, we will move to the R33 phase. In the R33 phase, we will leverage the large, harmonized dataset and apply a machine learning technique (CorEx - Correlation Explanation) to identify patient clusters within each patient population studied. HAF-PIPE and the procedures and guidelines from the R61 phase will then be extended to additional patient populations and made available to other ENIGMA working groups. The harmonized data, along with the tools and procedures for creating them, will be accessible to researchers following proposal submission and approval as a curated dataset. With success, this proposal holds the promise of significantly advancing data curation, harmonization, and sharing in the clinical neurosciences. We anticipate that our proposal will significantly advance our understanding of factors that impact outcome after injury and will yield a tool that will be useful across the neuroimaging community. Project Narrative Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can cause widespread alteration in brain structure and function, but sample size in imaging studies is often limited, and differences in data acquisition and variables can create obstacles to data sharing. We propose to develop an open-source workflow for utilizing behavioral and MRI data that addresses these concerns and allows for harmonization across sites, supporting “big data” analyses that can identify clinically-meaningful patient subgroups in TBI, a goal that is not feasible with small datasets. Achieving the proposed Aims will make a curated and harmonized dataset available to the TBI community as well as procedures and data processing pipelines adaptable to other disorders in the clinical

"Improving perioperative management to reduce postoperative acute kidney injury and long-term renal risk Postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients who undergo intraabdominal surgery procedures. AKI leads to increased risks of adverse outcomes such as hospital readmission and progression to chronic kidney disease, to reduced short- and long-term survival, and to greater costs to both patients and hospital systems. There are no effective treatments to prevent postoperative AKI, and as such, appropriate perioperative management is critical for mitigating its risk. However, there is an incomplete understanding of the ways in which patient and perioperative management factors interact to influence the risk of postoperative AKI. Traditional methods only identify generic, global risk factors and only quantify the average effects of each factor on AKI risk. Using an institutional cohort of intraabdominal surgery patients containing detailed preoperative (e.g., patient demographics, risk factors, comorbidities) and intraoperative data (e.g., hemodynamic variables, medications, fluid management), we will utilize a novel interpretable machine learning framework (SHAP [Shapley Additive exPlanations]) to model postoperative AKI risk. Machine learning provides the ability to model complex relationships among predictor variables, and SHAP quantifies the contribution to AKI risk for each variable in individual patients. We will compare this approach to traditional methods, comparing both predictive performance and the clinical understanding provided by the models. The knowledge gained will support the development and validation of novel, interpretable models in a large, multi-institution cohort and analyses to identify modifiable risk factors at all phases of the perioperative period so that personalized perioperative management strategies can be developed to reduce the risk of postoperative AKI and long-term renal outcomes. SPECIFIC AIMS Postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and major cause of morbidity and mortality in surgical patients. ADDIN EN.CITE 1 Postoperative AKI is associated with a 4-fold increased risk of mortality ADDIN EN.CITE 2 and increased costs (ranging from $12,100 to $47,700 per patient). ADDIN EN.CITE 3 AKI patients face greater long-term risks of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD), end stage renal disease (ESRD), and associated morbidity and mortality. ADDIN EN.CITE 4 Despite the severe ramifications of postoperative AKI, there are no effective strategies to identify individuals with an elevated risk or inform efforts to prevent its occurrence.5 Optimization of perioperative management may provide the greatest opportunity to fine-tune strategies to minimize AKI risk, as it is a volatile period with an abundance of potential opportunities for intervention. ADDIN EN.CITE 6,7 However, the complex relationships between perioperative factors and the risk of adverse renal outcomes have made it difficult to develop effective tools to guide perioperative patient management towards reducing AKI risk. Traditional risk stratification measures are limited in that they identify global risk factors but do not allow for personalized risk assessment at the level of an individual patient. We propose to use SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations), ADDIN EN.CITE 8-10 a novel framework that leverages the ability to fit complex models using machine learning approaches while providing interpretable explanations for individual patients.    We have extensive experience characterizing the epidemiology of postoperative AKI ADDIN EN.CITE 2,6,11,12 and the development of risk stratification tools for postoperative AKI ADDIN EN.CITE 13,14 and other surgical complications. ADDIN EN.CITE 15-21 Through the KL2 award from the Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) Irving Institute (CTSA), we assembled a cohort of intraabdominal surgery patients at CUMC, linking extensive electronic health record data to American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) data. We found that the addition of detailed intraoperative data improved the risk prediction model for postoperative AKI containing only preoperative data ADDIN EN.CITE 7 and evaluated the ability of machine learning to incorporate preoperative and intraoperative data to predict mortality. The proposed project will utilize our CUMC/ACS NSQIP cohort (N=3834) to refine the development of interpretable machine learning models and demonstrate clinical utility to identify modifiable perioperative factors to reduce postoperative AKI and long-term renal risk. To achieve this, we plan to: Develop and validate personalized risk prediction models for postoperative AKI using interpretable machine learning. We will use both preoperative (e.g., age, sex, comorbidities, surgical procedure) and detailed intraoperative data (e.g., fluid types and volumes, medications [e.g., vasopressors], hemodynamic measures [e.g., heart rate, blood pressure]) to develop machine learning models for predicting the development of postoperative AKI, defined by the consensus KDIGO criteria.22 Machine learning provides the ability to fit complex models that account for nonlinear relationships among predictors, and various algorithms will be tested (e.g., logistic regression, neural networks, random forest). The SHAP framework quantifies the contribution of each variable to AKI risk (both increases and decreases) for individual patients. We will compare performance to traditional approaches (i.e., parsimonious risk factor model using traditional logistic regression). We hypothesize that the machine learning/SHAP approach will have improved performance and provide a more robust understanding of critical risk factors and the heterogeneity of their effects on AKI risk among patients. This data will serve as the foundation to support the development and validation of novel, interpretable risk prediction models at all stages of the perioperative period (i.e., prior to surgery, during surgery, and immediately after surgery) in a large, multi-institutional cohort at 3 major academic centers. The knowledge gained will identify modifiable risk factors at all phases of the perioperative period so that personalized perioperative management strategies can be developed to reduce the risk of postoperative AKI and long-term renal outcomes.

PROJECT NARRATIVE Postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) is increasingly recognized as a significant contributor to morbidity – both short- and long-term – and mortality in surgical patients. Perioperative management plays a critical role in determining a patient’s risk of postoperative AKI, but there is an incomplete understanding of the specific ways in which perioperative management influences this risk. This proposal will develop tools to better recognize high-risk patients in real-time during the intraoperative course, to better understand AKI risk factors at an individual level, and identify risk factors for recovery after AKI, a novel paradigm for evaluating the severity of AKI and risk of long-term renal outcomes.",Improving perioperative management to reduce postoperative acute kidney injury and long-term renal risk,10475332,R56DK124325,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anesthesiology ', ' Anesthetics ', ' Anesthestic Drugs ', ' Anesthetic Agents ', ' Anesthetic Drugs ', ' Antifibrinolytic Agents ', ' Antifibrinolysins ', ' Antifibrinolytics ', ' Award ', ' Bibliography ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Blood Transfusion ', ' Burn injury ', ' Burns ', ' burned ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Cholecystectomy ', ' gallbladder removal ', ' Historical Cohort Studies ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Foundations ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Hepatectomy ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hip Fractures ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Hypotension ', ' Low Blood Pressure ', ' Vascular Hypotensive Disorder ', ' Infant ', ' Institutes ', ' Intubation ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Maps ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -
