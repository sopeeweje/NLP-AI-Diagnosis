"Improved multifactorial prediction of suicidal behavior through integration of multiple datasets Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for more than 40,000 deaths annually. Despite ongoing efforts to reduce the burden of suicide and suicidal behavior, rates have remained relatively constant over the past half century. Attempts to predict suicidal behavior have relied almost exclusively on self-reporting of suicidal thoughts and intentions. This is problematic because of well-known reporting biases and the fact that many people at high risk are motivated to deny suicidal thoughts to avoid hospitalization. Even though the majority of all suicide decedents have contact with a healthcare professional in the month before their death, suicide risk is rarely detected in such cases. Efforts to identify risk factors have also been stymied by the fact that suicide is a low-base rate event so that very large samples are needed to test the complex combinations of factors that are likely to contribute to risk. The widespread adoption of longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) has created a powerful but still under-utilized resource for detecting and predicting important health outcomes. In prior work using machine learning methods to analyze structured EHR data, we have developed predictive models that detect up to 45% of first-episode suicidal behavior, on average 3 years in advance. Here we aim to systematically extend and improve our EHR prediction methods in a large healthcare system (N = 4.6 million patients) by incorporating 1) external public record datasets (LexisNexis SocioEconomic Health Attribute data) that include environmental, socioeconomic, and life event information; 2) natural language processing (NLP) to leverage unstructured EHR text, including text-based scores that capture RDoC domains; 3) a novel method of deriving temporal risk envelopes to capture the time-dependent effects of individual risk factors; and 4) clinical risk trajectories that incorporate ordered temporal sequences of risk factors. We will systematically compare the performance of each of these approaches to identify optimal strategies for enhancing risk surveillance and prediction in healthcare settings. Completion of these aims would represent a crucial step towards novel, clinically deployable, and potentially transformative tools for improving outcomes for those at risk for suicide and suicidal behavior. Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for more than 40,000 deaths annually, with 1.4 million attempting suicide annually. Unfortunately, efforts to identify those at high risk have had limited success. We have previously used machine learning methods to predict risk of suicidal behavior using the vast resources of data available in electronic health records. The proposed research will extend and improve this work by leveraging external datasets, medical record notes, and trajectories of risk over time to facilitate novel, clinically relevant, and potentially transformative tools for improving outcomes for those at risk for suicide and suicidal behavior.",Improved multifactorial prediction of suicidal behavior through integration of multiple datasets,10149408,R01MH117599,"['Accounting ', ' Adoption ', ' Calibration ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Chronology ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Maps ', ' Markov Chains ', ' Markov Process ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' PF4 Gene ', ' Antiheparin Factor ', ' Blood Platelet Factor IV ', ' Blood platelet factor 4 ', ' Chemokine (C-X-C motif) Ligand 4 ', ' Factor 4 ', ' Heparin Neutralizing Protein ', ' Platelet Factor 4 ', ' Recombinant Platelet Factor 4 ', ' SCYB4 ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine B4 ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine Subfamily B, Member 4 ', ' gamma-Thromboglobulin ', ' platelet factor IV ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' tool ', ' Life ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Legal ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' information resource ', ' knowledge resource ', ' knowledge resources ', ' Information Resources ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Text ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Health Professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' markov model ', ' process repeatability ', ' process reproducibility ', ' Outcome ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' high risk ', ' electronic structure ', ' clinical risk ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' discrete time ', ' improved outcome ', ' data resource ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' risk prediction model ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' multiple datasets ', ' multiple data sets ', ' structured data ', ' feature extraction ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,501430,MA-08
"Social-Affective Vulnerability to Suicidality among LGBTQ Young Adults: Proximal and Distal Factors Project Summary/Abstract Rates of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB) among young adults have reached a crisis level, especially for those in the LGBTQ (i.e., lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, questioning and/or transgender) population, who face social stigma in addition to the typical developmental challenges. Although we know the general risk factors for suicide, those have limited utility in predicting how, when, and in whom suicide occurs. It is critically important to consider the role of social context because STB often occurs in response to a recent social threat event such as rejection and could be more likely in those who have altered sensitivity of neural social circuitry. The proposed R01 study in response to RFA MH-20-327 builds on social models such as Minority Stress Theory and the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide and examines social risk factors of STB from distal to proximal levels. The overarching goal is to predict change in STB, including cumulative intensity of STB and transition from suicidal thoughts to behaviors, on a time scale from hours to days to months. We propose that in LGBTQ young adults, STB occurs through social processing and regulation of socially generated negative affect (e.g., shame). Specifically, we examine the distal vulnerability factors of sensitivity in social brain circuitry and negative urgency, or the tendency toward impulsive behavior in the face of painful negative affect, and the proximal, time-varying factors of sleep dysregulation and social experiences (e.g., rejection). The study will test the association of these distal and proximal factors with STB; differences in these factors between LGBTQ young adults with vs. without STB; the interplay of distal and proximal factors; and the role of LGBTQ-related characteristics (e.g., victimization, outness) in STB. The study will include 130 participants age 18-30, all of whom identify as LGBTQ and 2/3 of whom have recurrent suicidal ideation and lifetime history of suicidal behavior. Participants will complete a detailed interview of STB, an fMRI scan using social threat paradigms, a 3-month protocol of actigraphy and smartphone-based assessment, and a follow-up interview at 6 months. Smartphone data will include ecological momentary assessment of social threat experiences and STB, as well as passively collected sensor data (e.g., social media app use, texting activity). Traditional and machine learning quantitative techniques will be applied to determine contributions of distal and proximal factors to STB (e.g., occurrence of suicidal behavior), individual differences in risk factors, and contributions of neural, sleep, social, clinical, and demographic factors to STB. The study will elucidate the role of modifiable risk factors in STB and have relevance to clinical neuroscience, suicidology, and prevention efforts. Project Narrative Suicide in LGBTQ young adults has reached a crisis level, but our ability to predict and prevent suicide has not improved in 50 years. We will use brain imaging, actigraphy, and smartphone technology to measure critical social precipitants of suicidality and their interaction with general risk factors. With machine learning, a technique based on artificial intelligence, we will combine these sources of data to determine the way suicidal thoughts and behaviors develop over hours, days, and months.",Social-Affective Vulnerability to Suicidality among LGBTQ Young Adults: Proximal and Distal Factors,10106761,R01MH124900,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Communities ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hotlines ', ' Telephone Hotlines ', ' Impulsive Behavior ', ' Interview ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Moods ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Shame ', ' Sleep ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' aberrant sleep ', ' disrupted sleep ', ' disturbed sleep ', ' impaired sleep ', ' irregular sleep ', ' sleep disruption ', ' sleep dysregulation ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Standardization ', ' Stress ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Self-Injurious Behavior ', ' Deliberate Self-Harm ', ' deliberate self harm ', ' intentional self harm ', ' intentional self injury ', ' self harm ', ' self injury ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Distal ', ' Clinical ', ' Distress ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Victimization ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' behavior change ', ' Visit ', ' trans* ', ' transgender ', ' experience ', ' social model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' trait ', ' Participant ', ' Exclusion ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' actigraph ', ' actigraphy ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' modifiable risk ', ' malleable risk ', ' Affective ', ' affective neuroscience ', ' emerging adult ', ' early adulthood ', ' longitudinal design ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual ', ' LGB ', ' Lesbian Gay Bi-Sexual ', ' Same-sex ', ' queer ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' brain circuitry ', ' social media ', ' Data Analytics ', ' family support ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' functional MRI scan ', ' fMRI scan ', ' functional magnetic resonance imaging scan ', ' recruit ', ' Text Messaging ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' sleep quality ', ' quality of sleep ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Queer ', ' LGBTQ ', ' Lesbian Gay Bi-sexual Transgender Queer ', ' smartphone based assessment ', ' mobile assessment ', ' smart phone based assessment ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,754061,PA-18
"Digital Monitoring of Agitation for Short-Term Suicide Risk Prediction Suicide is a prevalent and burdensome public health problem that warrants immediate attention. As the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, suicide claims the lives of more than 44,000 Americans each year. There is an urgent need to identify objective and clinically informative markers of imminent risk for suicidal behavior. Agitation, defined in DSM-5 as excessive motor activity associated with a feeling of inner tension, is listed as a warning sign for suicide by leading organizations and in widely used risk assessment protocols. Yet, prior research on the association between agitation and suicide has key methodological limitations (including related to the operationalization of agitation), which has resulted in minimal empirical evidence to support agitation as a proximal risk factor for suicide. Addressing this gap in knowledge has the potential for significant impact, including informing both the clinical assessment of suicide risk and the development of just-in-time interventions for detecting and responding to acute suicide risk. This project will overcome the limitations of prior suicide risk factor research by assessing multiple behavioral (motor activity and vocal features [e.g., volume, speaking rate, pitch]) and subjective components of agitation and suicidal thoughts and behaviors in a sample at elevated risk for suicide over a short, high-risk period. We will test the hypotheses that (1) objectively measured real-time indicators of agitation correlate with both momentary subjective ratings and validated, gold standard measures of agitation, and (2) both subjective and objective indicators of agitation improve prediction of short-term increases in suicide ideation, plan, and attempt above and beyond other distal and proximal risk factors. We propose to collect high-resolution self-report (e.g., ecological momentary assessment) and passive (e.g., accelerometer) data on agitation using smartphones and wearable sensors from psychiatric inpatients admitted for suicide ideation or attempt during inpatient treatment and the four weeks after discharge. Multi- level modeling and machine learning approaches will be implemented to examine (1) associations between objective and subjective real-time indicators of agitation and validated measures of agitation, and (2) the degree to which real-time indicators of agitation predict momentary fluctuations in suicidal ideation and suicide plan and attempt above and beyond other distal and proximal risk factors. The scientific aims of this study map onto the candidate’s training in three primary areas: (1) digital monitoring of high-risk patients, (2) advanced longitudinal multivariate data analysis, and (3) identification of behavioral and vocal biomarkers. The candidate’s training plan includes mentorship from Dr. Matthew Nock (primary mentor), Dr. Jordan Smoller (co- mentor), Dr. Maurizio Fava (co-mentor), and Drs. Rosalind Picard, Evan Kleiman, and Thomas Quatieri (consultants), as well as quantitative coursework at the Harvard School of Public Health and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This mentored five-year award will propel the candidate to an independent patient- oriented research career focused on using scalable methods to advance suicide prediction and prevention. PROJECT NARRATIVE To make an impact on the rising rates of suicide, we must improve the ability to predict when and for whom suicidal behavior will occur. This project overcomes the methodological limitations of prior studies of risk factors for suicidal thoughts and behaviors by studying a promising and clinically informative proximal risk factor for suicide (agitation) using mobile devices that provide high-resolution objective and subjective data, a high-risk sample (psychiatric inpatients), and a short period of high suicide risk (immediately following hospital discharge), and in combination with other distal and proximal risk factors. Findings will inform short-term suicide risk prediction and the development of novel just-in-time interventions for individuals at high risk of suicide.",Digital Monitoring of Agitation for Short-Term Suicide Risk Prediction,10173894,K23MH120436,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Anxiety ', ' Arousal ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Gold ', ' Grant ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Institutes ', ' Jordan ', ' Maps ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Motor Activity ', ' Locomotor Activity ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' Self-Injurious Behavior ', ' Deliberate Self-Harm ', ' deliberate self harm ', ' intentional self harm ', ' intentional self injury ', ' self harm ', ' self injury ', ' Agitation ', ' Psychomotor Agitation ', ' Psychomotor Excitement ', ' Psychomotor Hyperactivity ', ' Psychomotor Restlessness ', ' Restlessness ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Left ', ' Distal ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' diaries ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' suicidal ', ' Hour ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' American ', ' Manuscripts ', ' novel ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' multi-level model ', ' multilevel model ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' patient oriented study ', ' patient oriented research ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' DSM-5 ', ' DSM5 ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-V ', ' DSM-V ', ' K12 ', ' SECTM1 ', ' Secreted and Transmembrane 1 ', ' SECTM1 gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Research Training ', ' Resolution ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' Behavioral ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' digital ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' suicide death ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' Guide prevention ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' standard measure ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' Accelerometer ', ' accelerometry ', ' activity monitor ', ' activity tracker ', ' clinical biomarkers ', ' clinically useful biomarkers ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable biosensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' ']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2021,198520,MA-08
"Deciphering the role of neuronal and peripheral DNA methylation in suicide and bipolar disorder Project Summary/Abstract Prevention of suicidal behavior, especially among patients with mood disorders, is of uttermost importance among mental health professionals. Patients with bipolar disorder (BD), which affects around 1-2% of the population, are at a particularly high risk for developing suicidal behavior, with 25-50% of patients making at least one suicide attempt in their lifetime. In addition, although there is evidence that BD and suicide share a genetic risk and that stress may play a key role in suicidality, the mechanisms by which some patients are more vulnerable to suicidal behavior than others are vastly unknown. Guided by strong preliminary data, we hypothesize that epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, may underlie suicide risk among BD patients. Moreover, DNA methylation markers may provide clinically-relevant biomarkers for the identification of patients at highest risk for suicidal behavior. These hypotheses will be tested by completing three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will characterize DNA methylation alterations with the latest-generation Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip 850K platform in a discovery sample of neurons isolated from post-mortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissues from patients with BD that committed suicide or died of other causes and controls. Promising markers will be validated by oxidative bisulfite pyrosequencing and further explored by pathway analyses. In Aim 2, we will investigate the coordinated changes between genetic risk for BD and suicide attempt and DNA methylation alterations in post-mortem prefrontal cortex using the same cohort as Aim 1 and a replication cohort from the UTHealth Brain Collection for Research in Psychiatric Disorders. In Aim 3, we will analyze the clinical correlates of methylome markers of suicide in an independent cohort of adult patients with BD that have previously attempted to commit suicide or not, compared to healthy controls, from which a comprehensive dataset with demographic, clinical, and neuroanatomical data is available, as well as genome-wide methylation and genotyping data. Specific targets and pathways predicting suicidal behavior will be further explored by sophisticated statistics and bioinformatics tools while controlling for co-variables known to associate with suicidal risk, followed by the development of machine learning algorithms for the prediction of suicidality at the individual level. Of note, the overarching goal of this K01 is to further the PI’s expertise in the biology and clinical aspects of suicide, bioinformatics, post-mortem analyses, and epigenomics, which will ensure a methodologically strong foundation to launch an independent lab in psychiatric epigenetics. Importantly, a strong group of mentors and collaborators with a remarkable track record in training junior faculty has been selected to provide intellectual and technical input during the award period. In addition, the outstanding resources, facilities, and multidisciplinary scientific community at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston and the Texas Medical Center represent an ideal environment to ensure that the PI accomplishes his research and career objectives. This proposal is well aligned with the mission of the NIMH, and it will not only provide the PI with crucial training required to his transition to full independence, but also address important, testable questions regarding the poorly understood risk for suicide among BD patients and the lack of specific tools for the identification of vulnerable subjects. Project Narrative Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide, with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder significantly increasing its risk possibly due to a shared genetic and epigenetic risk. However, there are no clinically-useful biomarkers available for the prediction of suicidality in patients and very little is known about the molecular mechanisms of suicide in this disorder, which limits our ability to provide targeted prophylactic interventions for susceptible subjects. Here we propose to conduct a multidisciplinary translational study to identify a clinically-relevant DNA methylation biosignature to predict suicidal behavior in bipolar disorder patients and its association with clinical and neuroanatomical parameters.",Deciphering the role of neuronal and peripheral DNA methylation in suicide and bipolar disorder,10165832,K01MH121580,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Award ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Biology ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Faculty ', ' Fluorescence ', ' Foundations ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Masks ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Methodology ', ' Methylation ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' statistics ', ' Stress ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Universities ', ' bisulfite ', ' hydrogen sulfite ', ' hydrosulfite ', ' Generations ', ' Mediating ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' stress response ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' career ', ' Peripheral ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' peripheral blood ', ' Individual ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Knowledge ', ' prophylactic ', ' cell type ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' Medical center ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Prevention ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' Early identification ', ' commit suicide ', ' completed suicide ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Collection ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Health Professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' pyrosequencing ', ' epigenomics ', ' Population ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' translational study ', ' genome-wide analysis ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' high risk ', ' biosignature ', ' genome wide methylation ', ' genomewide methylation ', ' global methylation ', ' methylome ', ' methylation biomarker ', ' methylation marker ', ' bead chip ', ' BeadChip ', ' clinical biomarkers ', ' clinically useful biomarkers ', ' biomarker identification ', ' marker identification ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' methylomics ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' bioinformatics tool ', ' bio-informatics tool ', ' polygenic risk score ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,K01,2021,174843,TX-09
"Deriving a Clinical Decision Rule for Suicide Risk in the Emergency Department Setting ABSTRACT Significance: As recent national controversy over Joint Commission mandates proves, universal suicide risk screening in emergency departments (ED) will not achieve widespread adoption because confusion remains around which specific risk indicators to assess, and clinicians fear that such screening will lead to massive surges in psychiatric evaluations. To address these two implementation barriers, the proposed study will derive a clinical decision rule to support universal risk detection and optimize patient care workflow in adult patients. Investigators: The Project Team has extensive expertise in ED-based suicide risk screening and assessment (Boudreaux, Larkin), clinical decision rule design (Boudreaux, Stiell), predictive analytics (Wang, Liu, Simon), machine learning and informatics (Liu, Simon), industrial engineering (Johnson), and healthcare economics (Clements). A Clinical Advisory Panel ensures that the proposal is grounded in the practical realities of the ED. Innovation: The proposed study will be the first to apply industry standards for deriving decision rules to suicide risk and will directly inform the controversy regarding the relative strengths and weaknesses of universal versus targeted screening. We will pioneer new statistical innovations for rule derivation and will integrate simulation of potential workflow impact using industrial engineering modeling and economic analyses. Approach: We have already developed a pool of empirically supported, clinician-acceptable candidate suicide risk indicators. Data on these candidate indicators will be collected by trained research staff on 500 adult medical patients and 500 adult psychiatric patients from a large ED. Participants will undergo a comprehensive suicide risk assessment by a research clinical psychologist blinded to the indicators who will assign the participant to a criterion reference risk group: Negligible, Mild-Moderate, or High risk. Participants will be followed for 24 weeks after the visit to assess suicidal behavior, our secondary outcome. In Aim 1, we will derive a universal screening decision rule for “all comers,” as well as a variant to be used with patients presenting with a psychiatric chief complaint (targeted). In Aim 2, we will test whether a previously validated risk stratification algorithm using data from the electronic health record improves the performance of the decision rules. In Aim 3, we will model the potential operational impact of the rules through dynamic modeling of clinical workflow and economic costs and assessing clinician and patient acceptability in a new sample of 100 ED clinician-patient dyads. Environment: UMass has demonstrated its capability to support this study through several key preliminary studies, including the ED-SAFE studies, System of Safety, and other suicide-related studies set in the ED. Impact: By providing clear, evidence-based recommendations on universal screening and optimized workflow using standards accepted by emergency clinicians, this study will address two pivotal barriers to universal suicide risk screening, transforming the “right thing” into the “easy thing” so it becomes the “usual thing.” NARRATIVE Effective prevention of suicide among adult emergency department (ED) patients hinges on two indispensable components: effective identification of all patients who are at risk for suicidal behavior, and successful delivery of effective interventions to those with risk. Because many ED patients have hidden risk and do not present with psychiatric chief complaints, universal screening has been recommended by several prominent groups, such as the Joint Commission and the Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention; however, two trenchant barriers prevent such universal screening from being widely implemented, namely, (1) lack of clarity around the specific indicators to use for screening and (2) fear that screening all-comers will cause ED workflow to come to a grinding halt because of surges in psychiatric evaluations and boarding. The proposed study will address these two barriers by deriving the first clinical decision rule for use with all ED patients using rigorous standards and procedures and modelling its impact on workflow and costs, thereby revolutionizing the field's ability to actualize the first indispensable component of suicide prevention: effective, efficient identification and triaging of suicide risk, both hidden and obvious.",Deriving a Clinical Decision Rule for Suicide Risk in the Emergency Department Setting,10083111,R01MH118220,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Consultations ', ' Economic Models ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Medicine ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' indexing ', ' Industrialization ', ' Inpatients ', ' Interview ', ' Joints ', ' Literature ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Psychologist ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' Triage ', ' Measures ', ' Emergency Nursing ', ' ED Nursing ', ' ED nurse ', ' ER Nursing ', ' ER nurse ', ' Emergency Department nurse ', ' Emergency Room Nursing ', ' Emergency nurse ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' economic evaluation ', ' economic analysis ', ' Blinded ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Published Comment ', ' Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' In Situ ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' Performance ', ' Informatics ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' healthcare economics ', ' health care economics ', ' economic cost ', ' Cervical Vertebrae ', ' Cervical spine ', ' blunt force trauma ', ' Blunt Trauma ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Research Training ', ' Stratification ', ' Sum ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Screening Result ', ' Validation ', ' trend ', ' Derivation procedure ', ' Derivation ', ' electronic data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Behavioral ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' evidence based guidelines ', ' Evidence based practice guidelines ', ' evidence based recommendations ', ' suicidal patient ', ' suicide patient ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' secondary outcome ', ' clinical practice ', ' common rule ', ' screening ', ' Emergency Department patient ', ' ED patient ', ' ER patient ', ' Emergency Room patient ', ' Emergency Department-based Intervention ', ' ED-based intervention ', ' Emergency Department Physician ', ' ED Physician ', ' ER physician ', ' Emergency Physician ', ' Emergency room physician ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' Industry Standard ', ' inferential statistics ', ' Research Assistant ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' Self-Direction ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' implementation barriers ', ' implementation challenges ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2021,814463,MA-02
"Passive Assessment of Behavioral Warning Signs for Suicide Risk in Adolescents: An Idiographic Approach PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents and the rates have doubled since 2000. The rise in suicide rates is due in part to a failure to identify short-term risk factors for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Additionally, most existing research relies primarily on group-level methodological approaches to suicide risk assessment; intraindividual suicide risk processes are largely neglected. Because of the lack of knowledge on short-term and individual-level suicide risk, it remains unclear when and how to intervene with the individual adolescents who need it most. Three particularly promising observable, state-sensitive, temporally delimited, and modifiable proximal indicators of suicide risk among adolescents are social engagement, sleep, and physical activity. Although acute changes in these behavioral processes are often denoted as imminent “behavioral warning signs” of suicide, most existing research has examined these behavioral factors only as distal predictors and correlates of suicide risk. Importantly, their contribution to short- term risk using individual-level approaches (i.e., fully idiographic, “n-of-1” methods) remains unknown. The Candidate’s proposed K23’s overarching goal is to employ mobile sensing and actigraphy to assess whether objectively and passively measured acute behavioral changes from typical patterns of social engagement, sleep, and physical activity indicate proximal risk for increases in suicidal ideation using idiographic n-of-1 models in high-risk adolescents. It further aims to characterize the intraindividual network structure of these behavioral factors and suicidal ideation to enhance suicide risk assessment and guide intervention. Adolescents (N=100) admitted to an inpatient or partial hospital program due to acute suicide risk will be recruited. For a period of 3 months, wearable actigraphs will be used to assess adolescents’ sleep and physical activity and mobile sensing will be used to assess adolescents’ digital social engagement and patterns of movement to approximate additional indices of physical activity. Once-daily mobile surveys will be used to assess suicidal ideation. The proposed training plan complements the Candidate’s research plan and will facilitate training in: conducting translational digital health research in high-risk adolescents, passive mobile sensing, passive adolescent sleep and physical activity assessment via actigraphy, and advanced computational approaches to person-specific intensive data modeling. A team of leading scholars will provide expert mentorship to facilitate the Candidate’s training goals within the highly resourced environment of the Alpert Medical School of Brown University and Rhode Island Hospital. The proposed study will promote the Candidate’s long-term career goal to employ low-burden and scalable methods of assessment to develop personalized risk models that will improve the proximal prediction of suicide risk and inform intervention for youth. Through the execution of this research and training plan, the Candidate will be positioned to become a leader in the field of adolescent suicide. PROJECT NARRATIVE Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents and the rates have doubled since 2000. The goal of the present study is to develop personalized risk models of adolescent suicidal ideation based on passive and objective data sources (using wearables and smartphone sensors indexing social engagement, sleep, and physical activity).

"Innovations in Suicide Prevention Research (INSPIRE) ABSTRACT  Despite intensive prevention efforts from federal and state agencies, suicide is now the 10th leading cause of mortality overall in the US, increasing steadily over the past two decades and claiming more than 47,000 lives in 2017. The impact of suicide is particularly high among vulnerable populations such as adolescents and formerly incarcerated individuals. Suicide attempts also exact a high emotional, physical, and economic toll.  Although much research has focused on causes and predictors of death from suicide, progress in suicide prevention has been hampered by data linkage and methodological challenges. While national mortality rates are known, entities with the potential to implement large suicide prevention initiatives – health systems, insurers, and departments of corrections – lack the linked data to monitor suicide incidence in their populations, establish benchmarks, and establish an evaluation framework for prevention efforts. Many individuals who die from suicide have had recent contact with a health care, health insurance, or correctional system, representing critical missed opportunities to implement suicide prevention measures.  Two key needs are highlighted by the present RFA: linked surveillance systems that integrate healthcare, insurer (private and public), and correctional data with mortality outcomes to provide a framework for implementing and evaluating suicide prevention initiatives, and large and adequately powered datasets with rich health care access information over an extended period, matched with rigorous study designs for observational data. Therefore, our objective in the current proposal is to establish an in-depth suicide surveillance system linking multiple large, comprehensive databases and use that system to define suicide mortality benchmarks, identify predictors of suicide risk, generate risk prediction tools, evaluate suicide prevention efforts, and establish long-term workflow protocols to sustain the surveillance system. Our team is uniquely positioned to address these needs through our deep expertise in suicide, mental health, and health care utilization research; our extensive experience in application of rigorous epidemiological methods to large linked databases; our established access to comprehensive, regularly updated databases representing health care encounters, public and private insurance claims, corrections data, and suicide deaths in one of the most populous states in the US; and our successful work in prior projects to link all of these databases at the individual level using all appropriate safeguards and security measures.  This project will be the first to link these large state- and healthcare system-level databases to establish an ongoing suicide surveillance system to identify short and long term predictors of suicide and to inform and evaluate suicide prevention efforts in North Carolina and across the United States. We anticipate such suicide prevention efforts will get embedded in healthcare systems where at-risk individuals can be identified and referred for prevention and care, thereby preventing suicides and reducing their societal impacts. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will define suicide mortality rates for four key target populations of patients either engaged in health care, privately or publicly insured, or recently released from prison; will define clinical predictors of suicide mortality risk; will evaluate the impact of a health care system-delivered routine suicidal risk assessment protocol on suicide mortality risk; and will lay the groundwork for the ongoing continuation of the suicide mortality surveillance system.",Innovations in Suicide Prevention Research (INSPIRE),10259794,R01MH124752,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Death Records ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Future ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Inpatients ', ' Insurance ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' longterm care ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' North Carolina ', ' Patients ', ' Prisons ', ' Privatization ', ' Records ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Risk ', ' Security Measures ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Target Populations ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Work ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Clinical ', ' Imprisonment ', ' incarcerated ', ' incarceration ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Data Linkages ', ' Record Linkage Study ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Policies ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' experience ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Time Series Analysis ', ' suicidal mortality ', ' suicide mortality rate ', ' suicide mortality ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' case control ', ' correctional system ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' prevention evaluation ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Interruption ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' intervention for prevention ', ' prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' preventive intervention ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' years of life lost ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' suicide death ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' population based ', ' Prevention Measures ', ' clinical predictors ', ' study population ', ' health care availability ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' insurance claims ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,750074,NC-04
"Computerized Adaptive Suicidal Risk Stratification and Prediction ABSTRACT In the next 60 minutes, at least 57 people in the United States (US) will attempt to kill themselves, and five will die. Over 80% of these individuals encountered a healthcare provider in the 12 months before his or her death, but their risk will have gone undetected or, if detected, poorly quantified and not sufficiently monitored longitudinally. The proposed research will address this deficit by building and validating the Computerized Adaptive Test for Suicide Scale -- Expanded (CAT-SS EXPANDED), software that can screen for, quantify, and monitor suicide risk in a way far superior to existing instruments. It will enable at least three key Zero Suicide performance elements, including systematic, standardized frontline suicide risk screening and measurement (Identify), tracking and communicating risk across locations of care (Transitions), and monitoring changes in patient outcomes resulting from continuous quality improvement activities (Improve). In a paradigm shifting innovation, the CAT-SS EXPANDED will not only comprise the first multi-dimensional CAT of its kind, it will import suicide risk indicators that have already been validated by the NIMH-funded Mental Health Research Network (MHRN) directly from a health system’s electronic health record (EHR). This SBIR Fast Track has two phases. Phase 1 will build the CAT-SS EXPANDED, starting with well-established preliminary work and using iterative user testing with 20 clinician-patient dyads to refine the features. Phase 2 will have two Aims. The first Aim will validate the CAT-SS EXPANDED against an independent research clinician’s suicide risk stratification and suicidal behavior 24 weeks after the index visit (n=700). The second Aim will complete two-way integration of the validated CAT-SS EXPANDED into UMass’ EHR production environment and will evaluate clinical usability and acceptability with a new sample of ~30 suicide-risk enriched patients. Innovation and Impact: While traditional suicide screening tools exist, they are very limited, a conclusion supported by systematic reviews, the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention, and the NIMH. Because of these limitations, strong, well-validated clinical decision support to guide appropriate levels of care do not exist, reinforcing non-standardized and inefficient workflow, such as a tendency to conservatively order unnecessary emergency psychiatric evaluations. The CAT-SS EXPANDED will address these well-known measurement limitations using cutting edge strategies embodied in multi-dimensional CAT and EHR-derived risk indicators, an unprecedented capability impossible to achieve with existing measures. While this study focuses on the ED as a starting point because of its well-known risk burden and emerging literature supporting the value of universal suicide risk screening combined with brief interventions, the CAT-SS EXPANDED will be specifically designed and later tested as the first approach to suicide risk monitoring suitable for enterprise deployment across settings and locations of care, which is transformational for suicide prevention and fundamental to the Zero Suicide model’s emphasis on holistic system change. NARRATIVE  Having a psychometrically valid suicide risk instrument that efficiently screens for risk, provides risk stratification, and can be used across settings and easily integrated into the electronic health record (EHR) has tremendous potential to enable the enterprise implementation of the Zero Suicide model across an entire healthcare system, regardless of location of care. Because the software we will create and validate, the Computerized Adaptive Test for Suicide Scale – Expanded, blends computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and EHR suicide risk indicators previously validated using advanced analytic approaches by the NIMH-funded Mental Health Research Network, it is markedly different from existing instruments, which focus on a specific setting or patient population, rely on obsolete administration and psychometric methods, contain only screening capability with no monitoring components, and are not EHR-integrated in such a way as to tap into the data stored in the EHRs. This SBIR Fast Track proposal is necessary to keep pace with the burgeoning adoption of electronic patient reported outcomes and EHRs across healthcare and is foundational to the next step of designing better suicide interventions.",Computerized Adaptive Suicidal Risk Stratification and Prediction,10254382,R44MH118780,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Behavior ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' Manuals ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Tests ', ' Methods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Measures ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Production ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Standardization ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Tablets ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Schedule ', ' Blinded ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Intuition ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' suicidal ', ' Severities ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Visit ', ' Equation ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' Performance ', ' professor ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' brief therapy ', ' brief treatment ', ' brief intervention ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Intake ', ' Research Training ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Monitor ', ' point of care ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' systematic review ', ' computerized ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' suicide model ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' user centered design ', ' usability ', ' patient population ', ' secondary outcome ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' screening ', ' Emergency Department patient ', ' ED patient ', ' ER patient ', ' Emergency Room patient ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' data visualization ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' Research Assistant ', ' Self-Direction ', ' substance misuse ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' psychiatric emergency ', ' clinical decision support ', ' risk prediction model ', ' advanced analytics ', ' Data Store ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIMH,ADAPTIVE TESTING TECHNOLOGIES,R44,2021,746613,IL-07
"Improving Suicide Prediction using NLP-Extracted Social Determinants of Health Improving Suicide Prediction using NLP-Extracted Social Determinants of Health Suicide is among the leading causes of death worldwide and among United States Veterans in particular. Current methods of risk assessment are limited in their ability to accurately identify patients who are at the highest risk of suicide. The overarching goal of this proposal is to strengthen suicide prediction efforts by gaining a more granular understanding of the association between social determinants of health and suicide risk. Social determinants of health (SDH) refer to the conditions in which people are born, live, work, and age. A number of SDH are known risk factors for suicide. While SDH could be obtained from the structured EHR data, their scope is limited. A recent study has shown that EHR notes contain about 90 times more information about SDH than the structured data. To address this gap, we propose a stepwise approach that leverages the power of EHR and new computational methdologies to explore associations between natural language processing extracted SDH and suicide ideation, attempt and death. This approach is critical to the development of next- generation suicide prevention tools.

"Predicting Short-Term Risk for Suicidal Behavior after Contact with Outpatient Specialists: A Machine Learning Approach Project Summary/Abstract Because suicidal behavior (i.e., suicide and suicide attempt) significantly contributes to global disease and financial burden, the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention, the World Health Organization, and prominent researchers have called for the need to develop and improve prediction models for suicidal behavior. The period after contact with a health care professional is a particularly high-risk period, suggesting that prediction of suicidal behavior in the short-term after contact (i.e., defined as within one year in most studies) would address a critical need in the field to aid intervention efforts. However, previous short-term research has been limited by numerous factors, including a lack of research on youth samples, an overreliance on self-report measures or electronic health records, and the frequent examination of bivariate associations between only one predictor and suicidal behavior. The overall objective of the current proposal is to utilize several algorithms and assess their relative performance in the prediction of short-term suicidal behavior after contact with an outpatient specialist (defined as within 1, 6, and 12 months) using an unparalleled dataset. I will use data from a prospective, large-scale register of all outpatient mental health specialist visits among youth in Stockholm County, Sweden, consisting of approximately 160,000 visits by the onset of the current award. These individuals can be linked to population-based registers assessing a broad range of information (e.g., medical problems, academic information, neighborhood factors, parental psychopathology), which is a significant advantage over prior literature primarily studying demographic and psychiatric predictors in isolation. The central hypothesis is that the examination of numerous predictors within a large sample and the use of advanced statistical methods will significantly improve upon previous suicidal behavior prediction, which has remained slightly above chance. To achieve the overall objective, the current proposal is designed to apply machine learning algorithms through two specific aims: Aim 1: Apply variable selection algorithms that determine a limited number of salient predictors and, therefore, maximize interpretability; Aim 2: Apply ensemble algorithms that aggregate machine learning models and, therefore, maximize predictive power. The current proposal will significantly contribute to the field by examining short-term risk using machine learning techniques among a youth, outpatient sample, including varying follow-up windows and predictors across domains. Finally, the results from the current proposal will have positive impact by informing both 1) basic research through the identification of at-risk subgroups based on numerous predictors, and 2) the creation of a prediction tool that will aid in clinical practice. Project Narrative Over the past 50 years, prediction of suicidal behavior has remained slightly above chance levels, significantly hindering the development of effective intervention strategies. Because the majority of those who attempt or die by suicide are in contact with a health care professional within the year prior to their death, the current proposal serves to fill a critical gap in suicidal behavior prediction by exploring prediction methods for suicidal behavior among youth in the short-term (i.e., within 1, 6, and 12 months) after contact with an outpatient mental health specialist using an unparalleled dataset. Findings from the current proposal will have implications for clinical practice by identifying high-risk individuals for short-term suicidal behavior and aid clinical decision-making.",Predicting Short-Term Risk for Suicidal Behavior after Contact with Outpatient Specialists: A Machine Learning Approach,10245124,F31MH121039,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Award ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' indexing ', ' Inpatients ', ' Literature ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' statistics ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Sweden ', ' Translating ', ' World Health Organization ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Specialist ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Medical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' suicidal ', ' Techniques ', ' Visit ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' behavioral prediction ', ' behavior prediction ', ' Performance ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Health Professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' suicide death ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' effective intervention ', ' population based ', ' clinical practice ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' translational pipeline ', ' translational spectrum ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' financial burden ', ' financial distress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial stress ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIMH,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,F31,2021,48536,IN-09

PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will define suicide mortality rates for four key target populations of patients either engaged in health care, privately or publicly insured, or recently released from prison; will define clinical predictors of suicide mortality risk; will evaluate the impact of a health care system-delivered routine suicidal risk assessment protocol on suicide mortality risk; and will lay the groundwork for the ongoing continuation of the suicide mortality surveillance system.",Innovations in Suicide Prevention Research (INSPIRE),10457534,R01MH124752,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Death Records ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Future ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Inpatients ', ' Insurance ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' longterm care ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' North Carolina ', ' Patients ', ' Prisons ', ' Privatization ', ' Records ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Risk ', ' Security Measures ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Target Populations ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Work ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Clinical ', ' Imprisonment ', ' incarcerated ', ' incarceration ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Data Linkages ', ' Record Linkage Study ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Policies ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' experience ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Time Series Analysis ', ' suicidal mortality ', ' suicide mortality rate ', ' suicide mortality ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' case control ', ' correctional system ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' prevention evaluation ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Interruption ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' intervention for prevention ', ' prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' preventive intervention ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' years of life lost ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' suicide death ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' population based ', ' Prevention Measures ', ' clinical predictors ', ' study population ', ' health care availability ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' insurance claims ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,61042,NC-04
"The impact of social media use on precursors of adolescent suicide risk: Aprospective study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Suicide is the second leading cause of adolescent mortality in the US. Rates of adolescent suicide have increased in recent years, along with the advent and growth of social media use (SMU) in this population. SMU has been linked with sleep disruption, depressed mood, and suicidal ideation (SI), all of which are precursors of suicidal behavior. Existing research on the impact of SMU on sleep, mood, and suicidality is limited by cross- sectional designs and self-reported measures of SMU and sleep. To advance the field, prospective designs are needed that include objective measures and intensive monitoring of high-risk samples to rigorously examine the temporal relationships between SMU and suicide risk, defined as depressed mood and SI. This K01 proposal uses precisely such a design to test a conceptual model in which SMU predicts sleep disruption, which, in turn, contributes to depressed mood and SI among adolescents. The proposed study will harness smartphone technology to assess SMU using real-time passive data capture, actigraphy, and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) in high-risk adolescents. These methods, combined with in-person study visits, will examine the temporal and unique within-person associations between SMU and sleep disruption (Aim 1), SMU and suicide risk (Aim 2), and test whether sleep disruption mediates the relationship between SMU and suicide risk (Aim 3). Data-driven approaches of supervised machine learning will leverage the high-dimensional, intensively- monitored data to identify key SMU features predictive of suicide risk in adolescents (Exploratory Aim). The candidate will build on her strong foundation in adolescent depression and sleep research by acquiring new conceptual and methodological training in: 1) adolescent suicide risk, 2) technology and mental health, including social media use and mobile technology for real-time assessment; and 3) advanced computational skills. The candidate has assembled an interdisciplinary mentorship team to achieve her training goals within the exceptional environment of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh. Mentors (Brent and Moreno) are experts in adolescent suicide and social media, respectively, and both have had success in mentoring early career scientists. The candidate’s consultants have extensive expertise in adolescent development and EMA (Silk), adolescent sleep and actigraphy (Franzen), smartphone sensing (Ferreira) applied to clinical health (Low), and advanced statistical and machine learning approaches (Wallace). The proposed training and research will inform future R01 studies that use these innovative methods to identify and modify clinically-actionable risk factors, including SMU and sleep disruption, to attenuate near-term risk for adolescent suicide. This program of research has the potential to yield high-impact results that inform the development of suicide prevention programs that are personalized, scalable, and delivered in real time. The proposed research along with this training plan will uniquely position the candidate to be an independent investigator and leading scholar in the important public health problem of adolescent suicide. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adolescent suicide and suicidality have increased in recent years, which parallels the advent and rapid growth of social media use in adolescents’ daily lives. The proposed study will be the first in a broader program of research that leverages smartphone technology to examine how social media use impacts risk for the development and worsening of suicidal ideation and behavior among adolescents. This research program aims to identify modifiable risk factors, including social media use and sleep disruption, for adolescent suicide risk, and ultimately, contribute to the development of interventions that are personalized, scalable, and delivered in real time to prevent suicide.",The impact of social media use on precursors of adolescent suicide risk: Aprospective study,10212954,K01MH121584,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Arousal ', ' Beds ', ' Behavior ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Interview ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Moods ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sleep ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' aberrant sleep ', ' disrupted sleep ', ' disturbed sleep ', ' impaired sleep ', ' irregular sleep ', ' sleep disruption ', ' sleep dysregulation ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' statistics ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Silk ', ' Measures ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' career ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Attenuated ', ' depressed ', ' sadness ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Nature ', ' programs ', ' ideation ', ' Scientist ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Visit ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Adolescent Development ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' sleep onset ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' actigraph ', ' actigraphy ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' sex ', ' Depression and Suicide ', ' depression and suicidality ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' rapid growth ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' child depression ', ' adolescent depression ', ' adolescents with depression ', ' childhood depression ', ' childhood onset depression ', ' depressed adolescents ', ' depression in adolescence ', ' pediatric depression ', ' youth depression ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' modifiable risk ', ' malleable risk ', ' Affective ', ' therapy development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' high risk ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' clinically actionable ', ' social media ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile technology ', ' digital media ', ' high-risk adolescents ', ' secondary analysis ', ' high dimensionality ', ' recruit ', ' adolescent suicide ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' ']",NIMH,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",K01,2021,157755,NJ-06
"Digital Monitoring of Agitation for Short-Term Suicide Risk Prediction Suicide is a prevalent and burdensome public health problem that warrants immediate attention. As the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, suicide claims the lives of more than 44,000 Americans each year. There is an urgent need to identify objective and clinically informative markers of imminent risk for suicidal behavior. Agitation, defined in DSM-5 as excessive motor activity associated with a feeling of inner tension, is listed as a warning sign for suicide by leading organizations and in widely used risk assessment protocols. Yet, prior research on the association between agitation and suicide has key methodological limitations (including related to the operationalization of agitation), which has resulted in minimal empirical evidence to support agitation as a proximal risk factor for suicide. Addressing this gap in knowledge has the potential for significant impact, including informing both the clinical assessment of suicide risk and the development of just-in-time interventions for detecting and responding to acute suicide risk. This project will overcome the limitations of prior suicide risk factor research by assessing multiple behavioral (motor activity and vocal features [e.g., volume, speaking rate, pitch]) and subjective components of agitation and suicidal thoughts and behaviors in a sample at elevated risk for suicide over a short, high-risk period. We will test the hypotheses that (1) objectively measured real-time indicators of agitation correlate with both momentary subjective ratings and validated, gold standard measures of agitation, and (2) both subjective and objective indicators of agitation improve prediction of short-term increases in suicide ideation, plan, and attempt above and beyond other distal and proximal risk factors. We propose to collect high-resolution self-report (e.g., ecological momentary assessment) and passive (e.g., accelerometer) data on agitation using smartphones and wearable sensors from psychiatric inpatients admitted for suicide ideation or attempt during inpatient treatment and the four weeks after discharge. Multi- level modeling and machine learning approaches will be implemented to examine (1) associations between objective and subjective real-time indicators of agitation and validated measures of agitation, and (2) the degree to which real-time indicators of agitation predict momentary fluctuations in suicidal ideation and suicide plan and attempt above and beyond other distal and proximal risk factors. The scientific aims of this study map onto the candidate’s training in three primary areas: (1) digital monitoring of high-risk patients, (2) advanced longitudinal multivariate data analysis, and (3) identification of behavioral and vocal biomarkers. The candidate’s training plan includes mentorship from Dr. Matthew Nock (primary mentor), Dr. Jordan Smoller (co- mentor), Dr. Maurizio Fava (co-mentor), and Drs. Rosalind Picard, Evan Kleiman, and Thomas Quatieri (consultants), as well as quantitative coursework at the Harvard School of Public Health and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This mentored five-year award will propel the candidate to an independent patient- oriented research career focused on using scalable methods to advance suicide prediction and prevention. PROJECT NARRATIVE To make an impact on the rising rates of suicide, we must improve the ability to predict when and for whom suicidal behavior will occur. This project overcomes the methodological limitations of prior studies of risk factors for suicidal thoughts and behaviors by studying a promising and clinically informative proximal risk factor for suicide (agitation) using mobile devices that provide high-resolution objective and subjective data, a high-risk sample (psychiatric inpatients), and a short period of high suicide risk (immediately following hospital discharge), and in combination with other distal and proximal risk factors.

"Predicting Self-Harm, Suicide Attempt, and Suicidal Death using Longitudinal EHR, Claims and Mortality Data PROJECT ABSTRACT Suicide is one of the leading causes of death. As of 2015, annual age-adjusted suicide rate in the U.S. is 13.26 per 100,000 individuals, and on average, there are 121 suicides per day. While white males between 45 and 64 years of age are 4 times more likely than females to die by suicide, females attempt suicide 3 times as often as males. Recent data suggest that there are 20 times as many suicide attempts, which is generally considered a high and consistent risk factor for subsequent suicide. However, predicting and monitoring when someone will attempt self-harm and suicide has been nearly impossible. In this project, we plan to leverage large-scale, integrated electronic health record and claims from the New York City Clinical Data Research Network to study the suicidality in relation to emergency department (ED) visits or hospitalizations. In particular, using data on >10 million patients, we will develop novel NLP and machine learning models to identify patients at highest risk for self-harm, suicide attempt and suicide, and conduct a pilot study to assess the clinical utility of such models. We will also conduct a validation study using similar data from Kaiser Permanente Washington. PROJECT NARRATIVE As of 2015, annual age-adjusted suicide rate in the U.S. is 13.26 per 100,000 individuals, and on average, there are 121 suicides per day. Successful identification of patients who are at the risk of self-harm, suicide attempt, and suicide can lead potential clinical interventions for improving patient outcomes. This proposal will apply “big data” techniques to identify patients at risk of suicidal behavior using large-scale integrated clinical data.","Predicting Self-Harm, Suicide Attempt, and Suicidal Death

"Imaging the Suicide Mind using Neurosemantic Signatures as Markers of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior ABSTRACT: The assessment of suicidal risk is critical for treatment planning and monitoring of therapeutic progress for suicidal individuals. Current standard-of-care relies on patient self-report and clinician impression, which are not strongly predictive of imminent suicidal risk. This project advances a highly innovative approach to the assessment of suicidal risk, by using machine-learning detection of brain activation patterns that are neural signatures of individual concepts that have been altered in suicidal individuals. The overarching goal is to establish reliable neurocognitive markers of suicidal ideation (SI) and attempt (SA) in individual participants, and to assess these measures’ ability to predict future ideation and attempts. In previous work, this approach was applied to the fMRI-based neurosemantic signature (NSS’s) during the thinking about each of 30 words related to either to suicide, negative concepts, or positive concepts in 17 SI young adults and 17 healthy controls (HCs). A machine learning classifier was able to discriminate between the SI and HCs with 91% accuracy, based on differential brain activation patterns in the L superior medial frontal cortex and anterior cingulate, areas known to be involved in self-referential thinking. Within the ideators, NSS’s also discriminated between those with a history of a SA from those without such a history with 94% accuracy. Moreover, using the classification algorithm derived from this sample, we were able to accurately classify a second sample of suicidal individuals with 87% accuracy. It was also possible to assess the emotions differentially manifested during the thinking about these words, and thus to differentiate SI from HC with 85% accuracy, and SI with and without SA with 88% accuracy. On the basis of these promising pilot findings, we propose to study 300 young adult SI (about half of whom will have made a SA), 100 never-suicidal psychiatric controls, and 100 HCs, use fMRI to assess NSS at intake and 3 months, and assess for suicidal ideation and behavior at intake, 3, 6, and 9 months thereafter. The goals are to determine if: (1) NSS’s are sensitive to changes in level of suicidal ideation when repeated at 3 months; and (2) whether NSS can predict trajectories of suicidal ideation and behavior upon prospective follow-up. We will also examine the relationship between NSS activation of circuits related to self-referential thinking and the death/suicide Implicit Association Test (IAT) that examines the extent to which a person associates suicide-related concepts with self. Finally, as a translational goal, we aim to develop and test a neurally based IAT that examines associations of suicidal concepts with self and with emotions as informed by NSS findings. This study, by shedding light on alterations in suicidal individuals’ neural representation of suicide-relevant concepts could be extremely useful for: (1) identification of those with suicidal ideation who may not self-report their level of risk; (2) monitoring fluctuations in suicidal risk over time; (3) identification of emotional states associated with suicidal ideation; (4) guiding therapy to mitigate these alterations; and (5) the prediction of future suicidal ideation and behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE: This project takes a novel approach to the study of suicidal risk by examining the differences in brain activation patterns between suicidal and non-suicidal young adults when thinking about concepts related to suicide, negative, and positive emotions while undergoing neuroimaging. We use modern computing techniques called machine learning to identify brain activation patterns that differentiate suicidal and non-suicidal individuals and that can help to predict future suicidal ideation and behavior and will develop an easy-to-use computer test based on these brain activation studies that we hope will also be predictive of future suicidal ideation and behavior. If this project is as successful as our preliminary work, it will advance clinical practice by improving clinicians’ ability to: (1) detect and monitor suicidal risk, (2) understand alterations in thinking and feelings related to suicide in their patients; and (3) develop personalized treatment strategies for their suicidal patients based on their altered patterns of thinking and feeling that can more precisely and effectively reduce suicidal risk.",Imaging the Suicide Mind using Neurosemantic Signatures as Markers of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior,10130001,R01MH116652,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Computers ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Emotions ', ' frontal lobe ', ' frontal cortex ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Risk ', ' Shame ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Anterior ', ' Medial ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Therapeutic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' suicidal ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' impression ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' treatment planning ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' Detection ', ' Intake ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' suicide death ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' positive emotional state ', ' positive emotion ', ' Mind ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Implicit Association Test ', ' suicidal patient ', ' suicide patient ', ' suicidal individual ', ' standard of care ', ' treatment strategy ', ' neural patterning ', ' clinical practice ', ' longitudinal design ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' recruit ', ' predictive test ', ' predictive assay ', ' classification algorithm ', ' learning classifier ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,728998,PA-18
"Leveraging Computer Vision to Augment Suicide Risk Prediction Abstract Self-injurious behaviors occur at alarmingly high rates among adolescents, with suicide ranking as the second leading cause of death among those ages 15-24. A history of prior self-injury, including both nonsuicidal self- injury and suicidal self-injury (e.g., suicide attempts), has been consistently found to be the strongest predictor of future suicidal behavior, with evidence suggesting that the more severe such behaviors are, the greater the risk for future self-injury. Importantly, however, our current means of assessing severity of prior self-injury is almost entirely reliant on self-report, despite the fact that self-injury frequently leaves tangible physical markings. Although applications of machine learning in medical image analysis are growing exponentially, none have attempted to augment suicide risk detection through automated analysis of self-directed tissue damage. Leveraging computer vision to automatically assess images of tissue damage has the potential to obviate complete reliance on subjective patient report of self-injury severity characteristics. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to utilize computer vision techniques to automate the assessment of hypothesized self-injury visual severity indicators, learn new visual severity indicators, and determine the utility of these visual signals in predicting prospective suicide attempt risk. Community adolescents ages 16 to 18 years old will be recruited on Facebook and Instagram if they have currently visible physical marking(s) secondary to self-injury. Participants will securely upload images of markings secondary to intentional self-injury. A subset of participants will be followed longitudinally for three months to assess prospective suicide attempts. We will employ deep convolutional neural networks, a class of artificial neural networks, to develop algorithms to detect severity indices of self-injury and to examine their accuracy in predicting short-term prospective suicide risk. We will assess the generalizability of a subset of algorithms by applying them to a separate clinical sample of psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents ages 16 to 18 years old. This proof-of-concept study will set the stage to determine the feasibility of pursuing our long-term goal of integrating this technology into psychiatric care entry-points (e.g., emergency departments, inpatient units) to assess whether this technology can augment current suicide risk assessment models and in turn, serve as a clinical decision-support tool to help clinicians assess suicide risk. This research is significant in that it aligns with the NIMH/National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention’s Prioritized Research Agenda for Suicide Prevention’s Aspirational Goal 2 of determining suicide risk in diverse populations and settings using feasible and effective assessment approaches, and Goal 3 of finding novel ways to assess for imminent suicide risk, given that our target prediction period is three months. Project Narrative This application aims to determine whether a computer can analyze pictures of skin damage from adolescents who engage in self-injury and predict who is at risk for making a suicide attempt in the future.

"MAPS: Mobile Assessment for the Prediction of Suicide Project Summary  Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents. In addition to deaths, 16% of adolescents report seriously considering suicide each year, and 8% make one or more attempts. Despite these alarming statistics, little is known about factors that confer imminent risk for suicide. Thus, developing effective methods to improve short-term prediction of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) is critical.  Currently, our most robust predictors of STBs are demographic or clinical indicators that have relatively weak predictive value. However, there is an emerging literature on short-term prediction of suicide risk that has identified a number of promising candidates, including rapid escalation of: (a) emotional distress, (b) social dysfunction (i.e., bullying, rejection), and (c) sleep disturbance. Yet, prior studies are limited in two critical ways. First, they rely almost entirely on self-report. Second, most studies have not focused on assessment of these risk factors using intensive longitudinal assessment techniques that are able to capture the dynamics of changes in risk states. These are fundamental limitations. While suicidal ideation may precede an attempt by years, socio-emotional changes preceding a suicide attempt often occurs within the time span of minutes to hours. This study will capitalize on recent developments in real-time monitoring methods that harness adolescents' naturalistic use of smartphone technology. Specifically, we now have the capacity to use: (a) smartphone technology to conduct intensive longitudinal assessments monitoring putative risk factors with minimal participant burden and (b) modern computational techniques to develop predictive algorithms for STBs.  The project will include high-risk adolescents (n = 200) aged 13-18 years recruited from outpatient and inpatient clinics: (a) recent suicide attempters with current ideation (n = 70), (b) current suicide ideators with no attempt history (n = 70), and (c) a psychiatric control group with no STB history (n = 60). Effortless Assessment of Risk States (EARS) will be used to continuously measure variables relevant to key risk domains—emotional distress, social dysfunction, and sleep disturbance—through passive monitoring of participants' smartphone use. First, we will test between-group differences in risk factors during an initial 2-week period, and determine the extent to which risk factors derived from mobile phones improves discrimination over self-reported indicators. Second, we will use statistical techniques to test whether the risk factors improve short-term prediction of STBs (e.g., suicide attempts, hospitalization) during the 6-month follow-up period above and beyond clinical assessments. Third, computational machine learning techniques—based on a priori and learned features—will develop predictive models that utilize the full range of intensive longitudinal data collected by the active and passive monitoring methods to predict group membership and STB outcomes. Ultimately, by leveraging smartphone technology, we aim to improve the short-term STB prediction and provide clinicians and patients with reliable, scalable and actionable tools that will reduce the needless loss of life. Project Narrative Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents, and despite this pressing public health crisis, little is known about factors that confer imminent risk for suicide. However, recent advancements in mobile technologies afford the capacity to monitor known risk factors—including emotional distress, social dysfunction, and sleep disturbance—which has the potential to revolutionize our insight and clinical management of short- term risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Therefore, the present study will leverage adolescents' naturalistic use of smartphone technology, along with advanced signal processing and computational modeling approaches, to identify promising short-term predictors of suicide among high-risk adolescents, which ultimately, may reduce needless loss of life.",MAPS: Mobile Assessment for the Prediction of

"Harnessing Computerized Adaptive Testing, Transdiagnostic Theories of Suicidal Behavior, and Machine Learning to Advance the Emergent Assessment of Suicidal Youth (EASY). Abstract: The emergency assessment of acute suicidal risk in adolescents is a daunting clinical challenge because our current ability to predict suicide attempts is weak, and because the risk for suicide attempts in suicidal adolescents is high. Nevertheless, there have been no studies that have examined the best approaches to the prediction of suicidal behavior in suicidal youth presenting to a psychiatric emergency department (PED). To address this research gap, we propose a study of 1800 youth presented to a regional PED, 1350 of whom present for evaluation of suicidal risk, in which youth are assessed in the PED, and followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months to determine which youth have made a suicide attempt. We propose 3 complementary approaches to assessment of suicidal risk. First, in this competitive renewal, we build on our success in developing computerized adaptive tests for 6 diagnostic groups, plus suicidal risk, during our previous project period. These self- and parent-reports can be completed in a total of 10-15 minutes. Second, because theory-driven assessments of suicide risk have strong predictive power in adults, but have never been tested prospectively in adolescents, we propose to test the predictive power of measures of Shneidman’s psychache (mental pain) and Joiner’s Interpersonal Theory of Suicide, which posits interactive roles of perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belonging, and acquired capacity for suicide in driving suicidal risk. Third, we aim to use machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) of electronic health records (EHRs) to identify youth at risk for suicide attempts. We hypothesize that each of these approaches: (1) CATs for suicide risk and for depression, anxiety, bipolar, ADHD, oppositional defiant, and conduct disorders); (2) theory-derived measures of suicidal risk; and (3) ML and NLP of EHRs, will each be superior to clinical assessment alone in the prediction of attempts, and that the combination of the 3 approaches will be more powerful than any one of these approaches alone. This study is innovative because it is one of the first to use CATs for the prediction of suicidal risk, in a consistently high risk population, the first prospective test of two leading theories of suicide in adolescents, the first to use machine learning and natural language processing to identify EHR predictors of suicide attempts in adolescents, and the first to test a combination of approaches to the identification of imminent suicidal risk in adolescents in a sufficiently large, high risk sample. The study is of potentially high impact because it could identify brief, easily disseminated assessment strategies to identify youth at high risk for suicidal behavior and add to clinicians’ ability to match intensity and type of resources to those at greatest clinical need. The approaches to be tested in this study could yield assessments that reflect the two imperatives of emergency mental health care: brevity and accuracy. With better ability to identify who is at risk for suicidal behavior, we will be in a much stronger position to identify who needs intervention and reverse the disturbing, decade-long trend of increases in adolescent suicide and suicidal behavior. Project Narrative: This study will test the individual and conjoint predictive ability of three approaches to the prediction of suicidal behavior in adolescents seen in a psychiatric emergency room. These three approaches, namely, computerized adaptive testing, assessment of transdiagnostic risks from the perspective of two leading theories of suicide, and use of natural language processing and machine learning to identify predictors of suicidal behavior found in electronic health records, have to potential to be much briefer and more accurate than current clinical approaches to the assessment and prediction of suicidal behavior in adolescents. Therefore, this project has the potential to greatly improve our ability to identify youth at highest risk for suicidal behavior and to match the intensity and type of treatment to those with the greatest clinical need.","Harnessing Computerized Adaptive Testing, Transdiagnostic Theories of Suicidal Behavior, and Machine Learning to Advance the Emergent Assessment of Suicidal Youth (EASY).",10164860,R01MH100155,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Anxiety ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Future ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Institutes ', ' Judgment ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Oppositional Defiant Disorder ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Glean ', ' Conduct Disorder ', ' disorder of conduct ', ' disorders of conduct ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Evaluation ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Area Under Curve ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' suicidal ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Clinic ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' AD/HD ', ' ADHD ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' trend ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' computerized ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' child depression ', ' adolescent depression ', ' adolescents with depression ', ' childhood depression ', ' childhood onset depression ', ' depressed adolescents ', ' depression in adolescence ', ' pediatric depression ', ' youth depression ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' suicidal adolescent ', ' suicidal youth ', ' high risk ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Positive Valence ', ' prospective test ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' recruit ', ' psychiatric emergency ', ' predictive test ', ' predictive assay ', ' adolescent suicide ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,718829,PA-18
"Multimodal Assessment of Near-term Risk Processes for Suicide Ideation and Behavior Abstract/Project Summary  The suicide rate among young adults aged 18-25 has risen to the highest level in more than 30 years, yet our ability to accurately predict suicide attempts remains limited to distal, static risk factors. There is an urgent need for research to identify ways to assess who is most at risk for suicide in the near future, consistent with Aspirational Goal 3 of the National Action Alliance’s Prioritized Research Agenda. Accordingly, the overarching goal of this R01 from an Early Stage Investigator is to improve our ability to identify specific near-term, dynamic within-person processes that predict acute increases in a vulnerable individual’s risk for suicide. Social processes related to affiliation and attachment (e.g., social rejection or exclusion), as well as painful and provocative events (PPE; e.g., violent trauma and self-injury), are well-known distal risk factors for suicide. However, the role of dynamic cognitive-affective and biological responses to experiences of rejection for predicting near-term suicide risk in any individual is poorly understood. In addition, it is not known how the influence of rejection-related processes on near-term suicide risk may vary as a function of distal risk factors such as exposure to PPE. The current application outlines a multimethod intensive longitudinal study to examine dynamic affective and physiological responses to rejection as near-term risk factors for temporal fluctuations in suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB) over the course of hours to days, weeks, and months. We will also examine exposure to PPE as a moderator that amplifies intraindividual reactivity to social rejection, thereby further increasing suicide risk. Participants will include a diagnostically diverse clinical sample of 150 young adult men and women (ages 18 to 35) with clinically significant STB in the past 4 months. Multimodal assessments at baseline will include a 21-day random and event-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) protocol; laboratory paradigms with psychophysiological measures, self-reports, and assessment of implicit suicide-related cognition; and interviews using timeline follow-back (TLFB) methods. Assessments at 4-month intervals over the course of 12 months will include repeated laboratory tasks, physiological and implicit assessments, self-reports, and TLFB interviews to assess changes in responses to rejection, PPE, and STB over time. The proposed project has three specific aims: (1) Examine multimodal measures of within- individual affective and physiological responses to rejection as near-term, prospective predictors of within- person fluctuations in STB over time; (2) Examine exposure to PPE as between-persons distal moderators of within-person processes leading to near-term increases in STB at the individual level; and (3) Apply machine learning techniques to identify combinations of multiple time-varying within-person processes and static between-person differences that are most predictive of suicide risk over time. Results of this study will lead to advances in suicide risk assessment, identification of novel points of intervention, and development of personalized interventions to prevent suicide attempts among vulnerable individuals. Project Narrative Suicide is a serious public health problem that ranks as the second leading cause of death in adults under age 35. This research will contribute to our ability to better predict suicidal behavior in the near term, having direct implications for suicide risk assessment, risk stratification, and personalized intervention approaches aimed at reducing and preventing suicide.",Multimodal Assessment of Near-term Risk Processes for Suicide Ideation and Behavior,10054973,R01MH115922,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Arousal ', ' Sinus Arrhythmia ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cognition ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Standardization ', ' Stress ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Self-Injurious Behavior ', ' Deliberate Self-Harm ', ' deliberate self harm ', ' intentional self harm ', ' intentional self injury ', ' self harm ', ' self injury ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' TimeLine ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Distal ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Withdrawal ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Exposure to ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' suicidal ', ' Hour ', ' Event ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' respiratory ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Exclusion ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' Cognitive ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' physical abuse ', ' physical maltreatment ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' suicide death ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' Trauma ', ' Implicit Association Test ', ' Affective ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' person centered ', ' high risk ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' reducing suicide ', ' reduce suicidality ', ' reduce suicide ', ' reducing suicidality ', ' clinical predictors ', ' Social Processes ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' social exclusion ', ' marginalization ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Self-Direction ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' recruit ', ' individual response ', ' individualized response ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,670430,PA-18
"Prediction of suicide death using EHR and polygenic risk scores ABSTRACT Suicide is a leading cause of death that continues to increase, with over 47,000 preventable suicide deaths per year in the U.S. Although we have made great strides in using electronic health records (EHR) and other factors to predict suicidal ideation and behavior, our ability to reliably predict suicide death is close to zero. From a healthcare standpoint, predicting suicide deaths is tricky. We know that the incidence of suicide behaviors is far more common (~4%-5% per year) compared to suicide death (~0.01%-0.02% per year). Essentially, only a small fraction of those who engage in suicidal behaviors will go on to die by suicide. Knowledge of who these highest risk individuals are is critically important in directing prevention efforts and development of future targeted interventions. In addition, well over half of suicide deaths occur with no prior attempts, even accounting for lack of documentation of attempts in diagnostic codes. These “out of the blue” cases suggest one or more high-risk groups even more elusive to accurate prediction and prevention. Including genetic data of suicide deaths may offer substantial predictive improvement; genetic factors account for close to 50% of the risk of suicide death. Using the extensive genetic data, statewide longitudinal EHR resources, demographic, and familial data available to the Utah Suicide Genetic Risk Study (USGRS), we are uniquely poised to address this critical knowledge gap. Our primary focus will be to use machine learning methods develop models that predict suicide deaths. In addition, our large suicide death research resource will also allow us to model differences of suicide deaths with vs. without prior attempts. Of the ~9,000 Utah suicide deaths with demographics and environmental data, familial data, and 2 decades of longitudinal EHR data, the USGRS also currently has DNA from >6,000, which will increase to ~10,000 during the award period. Genome- wide molecular data is in hand for over 5,000 of these Utah suicides, allowing for tests of association of suicide subtypes identified using EHR data with “genetic phenotypes” represented by polygenic risk scores. The USGRS also has demographics, familial data, and longitudinal EHR data from 5 age/sex- matched Utah population controls for each suicide death, allowing for comparisons of non-lethal attempts to suicide deaths. In addition, we will collaborate with colleagues at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, who are currently developing EHR and polygenic risk models to study substance use disorder, anxiety, and major depressive disorder in 37,510 participants in the Mount Sinai BioMe Biorepository. They will expand this work to include suicidality to provide an additional resource of suicide attempt for our model development and testing. We will additionally study polygenic risk scores associated with suicide death vs. attempt using our resources, Mount Sinai BioMe, and a collaboration with Vanderbilt University for access to their Biobank and to suicide attempts in the UK Biobank.. Independent validation will be possible through genotyping of new Utah suicides collected throughout the project, with additional comparisons to attempt cases in large datasets available through the PsychEMERGE consortium. NARRATIVE We will develop and validate models to predict suicide death, as distinct from suicide attempt, using electronic health records (EHR), demographics, environmental stresses, familial risks, and genetic differences. We will use 9,000 Utah suicides with longitudinal EHR data (>5,000 of these with molecular data growing to 10,000 by the end of the study), Utah population controls, collaborations with Mount Sinai Medical School and Vanderbilt University, and validation/replication with the large EHR and molecular data resources in the PsychEMERGE Consortium.",Prediction of suicide death using EHR and polygenic risk scores,10239191,R01MH123489,"['Accounting ', ' Anxiety ', ' Award ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Elements ', ' Future ', ' Genotype ', ' Hand ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Medical Examiners ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Population Control ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Utah ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Area ', ' Individual ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' environmental stresses ', ' environmental stressor ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' deprivation ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' model development ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' Collection ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Grouping ', ' groupings ', ' sex ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' comparison group ', ' comparator group ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' suicide death ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' population based ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' data resource ', ' early life stress ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' polygenic risk score ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2021,688954,UT-02
"Development and clinical interpretation of machine learning emergency department suicide prediction algorithms using electronic health records and claims Project Summary  Preventing suicide is one of the great public health challenges facing the US health care system. People who seek emergency care for mental health complaints are at high short-term risk of non-fatal suicide events and suicide. Yet identifying high-risk patients is challenging as risk fluctuates in a poorly understood manner. It is especially difficult to evaluate risk in emergency settings, where access to the patient's mental health history is often limited. The proposed project seeks to address this critical knowledge gap by pairing data mining and machine learning methods with rich data sources in order to develop short-term prediction models of non-fatal suicidal events and suicide for patients presenting to EDs with mental health problems.  The specific aims of this study are to 1) apply advanced machine learning data analytic techniques to electronic health record (EHR) data to develop a clinically rich description of ED mental health patient characteristics that predict suicide and non-fatal suicidal events over a 90- day follow-up period; 2) use longitudinal and temporal features of EHR and claims data from the 180 days preceding the ED mental health visit to generate clinically interpretable suicide and suicidal event risk scores; and 3) convene ED physicians to enhance model development, clinical interpretability, and utility of a suicide risk assessment clinical decision support tool.  We will achieve these aims by leveraging several different sophisticated machine learning analytic methods of existing longitudinal clinical and service use information. We seek to develop point-in-time, short-term risk scores for suicidal symptoms and suicide death and the clinical features that drive that risk that may be used to inform clinical risk assessment and management of patients who present to EDs with mental health complaints. Risk algorithms will be developed and validated using health information from a large combined EHR and claims dataset with over 24 million commercially insured patients, which is linked to the National Death Index. Findings will yield new insights regarding patient-specific risk factors and potential targets for intervention. By drawing on data sources common to most health care systems and using efficient computer algorithms this approach has the potential to develop clinically interpretable suicide risk scores at the point of ED evaluation and following disposition. This will help front- line clinicians focus their efforts on high risk patients during high risk periods to inform intervention decisions about suicide risk. Project Narrative Although patients with mental disorders who present to emergency departments have over a 30-fold increased odds of suicide, most are not identified as at risk during these visits. This project will apply machine learning methods to electronic health records and medical claims in order to develop and evaluate point-in-time short- term longitudinal suicide risk algorithms for patients presenting to the emergency department with mental health complaints. This new knowledge will provide emergency department clinicians with interpretable, patient-specific information about short-term risk of suicide attempts and suicide.",Development and clinical interpretation of machine learning emergency department suicide prediction algorithms using electronic health records and claims,10277514,R01MH126895,"['Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Crisis Intervention ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Emergency Medicine ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' indexing ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' medication prescription ', ' prescribed medication ', ' Psychiatrist ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Risk Management ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' suicidal ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' trait ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' model development ', ' Provider ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Update ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Emergency Care ', ' ED care ', ' ER care ', ' Emergency Department care ', ' Emergency Room care ', ' Emergency health care ', ' Emergency healthcare ', ' Emergency medical care ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Clinical Services ', ' Output ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' suicide death ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' suicidal patient ', ' suicide patient ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' clinical risk ', ' Emergency Department Physician ', ' ED Physician ', ' ER physician ', ' Emergency Physician ', ' Emergency room physician ', ' Emergency Department evaluation ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' support tools ', ' Data Analytics ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' health service use ', ' health service utilization ', ' emergency settings ', ' clinical decision support ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' clinical encounter ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,784177,PA-03
"Leveraging deep learning and clinical notes for surveillance and prediction of intentional self-harm and suicide PROJECT SUMMARY: Suicide is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, with more than 47,000 individuals dying by suicide each year. The identification of individuals at risk for suicide is an important step for a comprehensive approach to suicide prevention. Despite extensive research on risk factors for intentional self-harm and suicide, prospective prediction of suicide remains a difficult task with poor predictive power. Recent studies suggest that new machine learning methods applied to electronic health records (EHR) show promising results. However, more advanced computational approaches such as deep learning, have not been fully leveraged in this field, especially in the area of advanced methods for text classification of clinical notes. Our aims in this project, are to improve the phenotyping of suicidal behavior, and the prediction of future suicidal behavior and suicide deaths by integrating mortality data with EHR data and leveraging state-of-the-art natural language computational approaches. We will also investigate methods for explain ability and interpretability of the models to improve future adoption by clinicians. We will validate our models by examining reproducibility and generalizability across two health systems using similar data at both sites. Project Narrative Suicide is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, with more than 47,000 individuals dying by suicide each year. In this project, we plan to improve the identification of patients at risk for suicide and suicidal behavior, by linking mortality data with electronic health records data and using state-of-the-art artificial intelligence such as deep learning.

"Linking VA and non-VA data to study the risk of suicide in chronic pain patients. PROJECT SUMMARY The overall objective of this proposal is to integrate large-scale VA and non-VA data across New York, Chicago and Florida to study the risk of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, suicide and accidental opioid overdose deaths in Veterans receiving chronic opioid therapy (COT). PROJECT ABSTRACT Opioid misuse and its associated risks of suicide is a national public health emergency. Current estimates suggest that chronic pain impacts nearly half of Veterans, and studies have shown that people who experience chronic pain are at increased risk for a number of adverse health outcomes, including suicide and opioid overdose. Although multiple national initiatives within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) have attempted to decrease the number of veterans with opioid prescriptions for pain management, these efforts focus on analyzing VA data only. Given that many Veterans receive care and treatment from non-VA community clinics and medical centers, it is imperative to study suicide or accidental overdose risk amongst Veterans with pain disorders by analyzing both VA and non-VA data. The overall objective of this proposal is to integrate large-scale VA and non-VA data across New York, Chicago and Florida to study the risk of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, suicide and accidental opioid overdose deaths in Veterans receiving chronic opioid therapy (COT).",Linking VA and non-VA data to study the risk of suicide in chronic pain patients.,10233949,R01MH121907,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Pain management ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' pain treatment ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Chicago ', ' Communities ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Firearms ', ' Florida ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Health Services Administration ', ' indexing ', ' Learning ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' New York ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Standardization ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Time ', ' Veterans ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' chronic pain ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Homelessness ', ' homeless ', ' unhoused ', ' Individual ', ' Opioid ', ' Opiates ', ' Funding ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pain Disorder ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Modeling ', ' deprivation ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Text ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' suicide rate ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' data integration ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' alcohol misuse ', ' ethanol misuse ', ' unhealthy alcohol use ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' demographics ', ' Medicare claim ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' electronic structure ', ' overdose death ', ' overdose fatalities ', ' risk mitigation ', ' public health emergency ', ' social health determinants ', ' prescription opioid ', ' licit opioid ', ' opiate medication ', ' opioid medication ', ' prescribed opiate ', ' prescribed opioid ', ' prescription opiate ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' opioid use ', ' opiate consumption ', ' opiate drug use ', ' opiate intake ', ' opiate use ', ' opioid consumption ', ' opioid drug use ', ' opioid intake ', ' opioid therapy ', ' opiate therapy ', ' opioid overdose ', ' opiate overdose ', ' opiate related overdose ', ' opioid drug overdose ', ' opioid induced overdose ', ' opioid intoxication ', ' opioid medication overdose ', ' opioid poisoning ', ' opioid related overdose ', ' opioid toxicity ', ' opioid mortality ', ' opiate deaths ', ' opiate mortality ', ' opioid deaths ', ' opioid overdose death ', ' opioid related death ', ' care fragmentation ', ' chronic pain patient ', ' patient with chronic pain ', ' overdose risk ', ' data warehouse ', ' opioid misuse ', ' non-medical opioid use ', ' nonmedical opioid use ', ' opiate misuse ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' community clinic ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' Veterans Health Administration ', ' Veterans Health Affairs ', ' provider factors ', ' clinician factors ', ' clinician-level factors ', ' physician factors ', ' physician-level factors ', ' provider-level factors ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2021,707472,NY-12
"Automated Detection of Suicide Attempt Risk among Bereaved Individuals Project Summary Bereaved individuals, especially those who meet criteria for Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD) and those bereaved by suicide, have substantial risk of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide. These vulnerable bereaved subgroups are also less likely to receive informal support or access mental health care, creating a pressing need to detect their suicide risk. Each year, well over a thousand unsolicited bereaved individuals visit our Cornell Center for Research on End-of-Life Care website and complete an online tool to determine if they meet criteria for PGD (over 6,000 completers to date). Compared to community-based bereaved samples, those who complete our online tool disproportionately meet criteria for PGD (e.g., ~30% vs. ~10%) and are suicide bereaved (~10% vs. ~2%). Thus, astoundingly, >35% of those who visit our Center website and complete our online diagnostic tool are at significantly elevated risk for suicidal ideation and/or attempts. To respond to the need to detect suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) among our bereaved website visitors, we propose to develop a web-based tool for the detection of suicide attempt risk. We will leverage our Living Memory Home, an online memorial application residing on our Center website, by enhancing its features to optimize data collection, including data on potential implicit indicators of a bereaved person's suicide attempt risk (Aim #1). Data will be gathered on 100 Living Memory Home users daily for a week, followed by a 1-week, 1- and 6-month post-baseline follow-up assessment. The study will generate ~30 texts/subject in the Living Memory Home's Imagined Dialogues with the deceased, and reflections, dreams, stories, and touchstones in Narrative Notes (~3,000 texts in total from all users). Boot-strapping resampling, natural language processing and machine learning techniques will then be applied to develop machine learning models predicting suicide attempt risk based on bereaved subjects' baseline, 1-week, 1- and 6-month Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale scores (Aim #2). Our primary outcome will be the 1-week CSSRS score. We will, thus, develop and then pilot test an automated way to detect bereaved persons'; suicide attempt risk based on their interactions with the Living Memory Home. This is a first step toward development of a safe, accurate, potentially scalable online tool for the detection of suicide attempt risk among bereaved individuals. Project Narrative (Relevance) Bereaved individuals, and particularly those bereaved by suicide and who meet criteria for Prolonged Grief Disorder, are at substantially elevated risk for suicidal thoughts and attempts. This project, applying machine learning techniques to detect suicidal attempt risk among bereaved individuals using an online bereavement resource, the Living Memory Home, is a first step in the development of a safe and effective online tool for the detection of suicide attempt risk among bereaved individuals.",Automated Detection of Suicide Attempt Risk among Bereaved Individuals,10077375,R21MH121886,"['Bereavement ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dreams ', ' dreaming ', ' Future ', ' Grief reaction ', ' Grief ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Memory ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Persons ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' New York ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Savings ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' United Kingdom ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Severities ', ' Reaction ', ' Techniques ', ' Visit ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' metropolitan ', ' skills ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' help seeking ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' Reporting ', ' end of life care ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Subgroup ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' Behavioral ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' suicide model ', ' expressive writing ', ' expressive writing therapy ', ' Implicit Association Test ', ' suicidal individual ', ' loved ones ', ' primary outcome ', ' follow up assessment ', ' followup assessment ', ' informal support ', ' web-based tool ', ' recruit ', ' predictive test ', ' predictive assay ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R21,2021,206083,NY-12
"Leveraging EHR data to evaluate key treatment decisions to prevent suicide-related behaviors PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Key focus: Research leveraging EHR data (PAR-18-929) to prevent suicide-related behaviors (SRBs) Objectives: To use augmented Veterans Health Administration (VHA) EHR data to develop Personalized Treatment Rules (PTRs) to help guide clinicians in making key treatment decisions for mentally ill patients aimed at reducing SRBs over the next 12 months. Specific aims: We will focus on two decisions: the decision of primary care physicians on how to treat patients coming to them for help with common mental disorders (CMD; “the PCP study”); and the decision of VHA Suicide Prevention Coordinators on whether to hospitalize patients who just made nonfatal suicide attempts or treat them as outpatients (“the SPC study”). Both are recognized as critical decisions, with no globally optimal treatment path for either and little guidance on how to decide among the treatment options. Research design: We will use a prospective observational design. The PCP study will be based on EHR data for the roughly 583,000 incident PCP visits of VHA patients for help with a CMD in 2010-2016. An incident visit will be defined as where the patient had not received other CMD treatment in the prior 12 months. The five broad PCP treatment options are pharmacotherapy, referral to psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy plus measurement based collaborative care, and referral to a psychiatrist. The outcomes will be either an SRB (the primary outcome, either suicide death or administratively-recorded nonfatal suicide attempt) over the next 12 months or psychiatric hospitalization with suicidality over the same follow-up period (the secondary outcome). These outcomes occurred after 12,292 2010-2016 incident visits. The SPC study will be based on the 67,196 2010-2016 VHA Suicide Behavior Reports completed after a nonfatal VHA outpatient suicide attempt. Roughly half of these cases were hospitalized and the others treated as outpatients. A repeat SRB occurred over the next 12 months for 19,829 of these cases. Methods: A best-practice method of balancing baseline covariates will be used to adjust for nonrandom assignment across treatment options. Baseline covariates will include: prior EHR data; EHR data available for the focal treatment decision, including information abstracted from clinical notes with natural language processing; small-area geocode data for patient addresses; individual-level data from the LexisNexis Social Determinants of Health Database on patient finances, employment, marital status, and criminal justice involvement; and information about prior practice patterns of treating clinicians and practices-resources of treatment settings. A cutting-edge ensemble machine learning method will be used to analyze these weighted data to develop PTRs. Cross-validation in the 2010-2016 data and validation in 2017-2018 data (not available until the third year of the study) will be used to estimate out-of-sample performance of the PTRs. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to develop precision treatment rules for (i) primary care physicians trying to develop a treatment plan for patients seeking treatment for common mental disorders and (ii) suicide prevention coordinators trying to develop a treatment plan for a patient who just made a nonfatal suicide attempt with the goal of developing a plan that will minimize prevalence of suicide-related behaviors (either suicide deaths or nonfatal attempts) over the next 12 months. The work will be carried out in the Veterans Health Administration system, but will have implications for the broader population. The research has the potential to have great public health significance given that suicide-related behaviors (SRBs) are important public health problems, that the decisions we will study occur very often and have important effects on SRBs, that clinicians currently have no clear guidance on how to make these decisions, and that the design we propose to use has a high probability of success

"Distinguishing Clinical and Genetic Risk of Suicidal Ideation from Attempts to Inform Prevention One hundred and twenty-three Americans die by suicide every day, and 800,000 individuals die from suicide globally every year. Five times as many people attempt suicide and 10-25 times as many contemplate suicide every year. Rates of suicidal thoughts or ideation and suicidal behaviors are increasing. Suicidal ideation alone causes mental and physical harm and is associated with worsened statuses of other illnesses. Suicidal ideation is often documented by clinical providers in their notes but has been shown to only be included in diagnostic or billing codes 3% of the time. Historical suicide attempts are also under- captured by billing codes alone. Improving identification of those with suicidal ideation and attempts might enhance prevention through earlier contact with those at risk.  A growing literature shows that clinical predictive models with longitudinal electronic health records (EHR) can predict suicide attempts with good performance. These models have also been used by groups like ours to improve power of large-scale genetic analyses of suicide attempt risk. The investigators used their validated models to identify the signal for suicide attempt, a “phenotype”, to run genetic analyses showing suicide attempt risk is 4% heritable. This team also showed that suicide attempt risk was significantly genetically correlated with depressive symptoms, neurotic symptoms, and schizophrenia.  The investigators propose to validate a phenotype of suicidal ideation and to improve their existing phenotypes of attempt risk to power large-scale genetic analyses across two major biobanks, Vanderbilt’s BioVU and the UK Biobank. They will use natural language processing (NLP) and analytics on Vanderbilt’s EHR to develop and test a phenotype of suicidal ideation. They will use NLP to improve capture of cases of suicide attempt to refine existing algorithms. They will apply these phenotypes at scale to BioVU. Their Stanford team members will use patient-reported suicidal ideation histories in another major biobank, UK Biobank, to independently run genetic analyses of suicidal ideation risk in a different population. They will further analyze clinical and genetic risk factors to better understand who will transition from suicidal ideation to suicide attempt.  The project combines expertise in clinical informatics, machine learning, and large-scale genomics, as well as domain-specific expertise in suicide risk research. Spanning two major biobanks across two countries, the algorithms and methods developed have maximal portability, facilitating next-step investigations. Successful identification of suicidal ideation and attempt risk might inform clinical prevention. Better understanding of risk factors that predict who will proceed from suicidal ideation to suicidal behaviors would help allocate prevention resources to those who need them most. Project Narrative  Suicide is one of the top 10 leading causes of death in the United States and 10-25 times the number that die contemplate suicide every year. Large gaps remain in our understanding of genetic risk factors of suicidal ideation and attempt as well as genetic and clinical risk factors that contribute to transition from ideation to attempt. This investigation will use natural language processing, machine learning, electronic health records for over 1 million people, and two major biobanks from the United States and the United Kingdom to study the clinical and genetic risk factors necessary to improve identification of patients at highest risk of suicidal behaviors.",Distinguishing Clinical and Genetic Risk of Suicidal Ideation from Attempts to Inform Prevention,10061648,R01MH121455,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitals ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Literature ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Neurotic Disorders ', ' Neuroses ', ' Psychoneuroses ', ' neurotic ', ' neuroticism ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' United Kingdom ', ' United States ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Family Study ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Clinical ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Investigation ', ' suicidal ', ' Country ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' member ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Reporting ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' portability ', ' Genomics ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' genetic association ', ' Preventive ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Heritability ', ' open source ', ' high risk ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' clinical risk ', ' algorithmic methodologies ', ' algorithmic methods ', ' clinical predictors ', ' Genetic study ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' genetic architecture ', ' structured data ', ' phenotyping algorithm ', ' ']",NIMH,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,543736,TN-05
"Penn Innovation in Suicide Prevention Implementation Research (INSPIRE) Center This proposal is to develop the University of Pennsylvania’s Innovation in Suicide Prevention Implementation Research (INSPIRE) Center. Suicide is a leading cause of death in the US that disproportionately affects minority and disenfranchised populations, including Blacks, Hispanics and sexual/gender minorities. Yet, these groups often are not included in suicide prevention research. Guided by a conceptual model based on the Integrated Behavior Model, which posits that organizational culture, policies, and resources (or lack thereof) impact the provider’s attributes and behaviors, INSPIRE brings together psychology, implementation science, health economics, machine learning, health information technology, psychiatry and participatory research experts to apply innovative interdisciplinary approaches to suicide prevention. INSPIRE’s overarching goals are to develop and adapt practice-based and other suicide prevention interventions for underserved groups and to design and test implementation strategies to optimize how evidence-based practices can be brought to scale efficiently and with high fidelity, for optimal effectiveness. INSPIRE will prioritize strategies that can be rapidly deployed in a range of practice settings, including those with limited resources, thereby increasing their reach and public health impact. Penn INSPIRE will use state-of-the-science methods from participatory research to actively engage stakeholders from many sectors – including patients, providers, and payers – at every level of its work to accomplish its Specific Aims. INSPIRE will apply innovative, interdisciplinary behavior change and implementation science methods to develop, adapt, and evaluate cost effective interventions.

"Deriving a Clinical Decision Rule for Suicide Risk in the Emergency Department Setting ABSTRACT Significance: As recent national controversy over Joint Commission mandates proves, universal suicide risk screening in emergency departments (ED) will not achieve widespread adoption because confusion remains around which specific risk indicators to assess, and clinicians fear that such screening will lead to massive surges in psychiatric evaluations. To address these two implementation barriers, the proposed study will derive a clinical decision rule to support universal risk detection and optimize patient care workflow in adult patients. Investigators: The Project Team has extensive expertise in ED-based suicide risk screening and assessment (Boudreaux, Larkin), clinical decision rule design (Boudreaux, Stiell), predictive analytics (Wang, Liu, Simon), machine learning and informatics (Liu, Simon), industrial engineering (Johnson), and healthcare economics (Clements). A Clinical Advisory Panel ensures that the proposal is grounded in the practical realities of the ED. Innovation: The proposed study will be the first to apply industry standards for deriving decision rules to suicide risk and will directly inform the controversy regarding the relative strengths and weaknesses of universal versus targeted screening. We will pioneer new statistical innovations for rule derivation and will integrate simulation of potential workflow impact using industrial engineering modeling and economic analyses. Approach: We have already developed a pool of empirically supported, clinician-acceptable candidate suicide risk indicators. Data on these candidate indicators will be collected by trained research staff on 500 adult medical patients and 500 adult psychiatric patients from a large ED. Participants will undergo a comprehensive suicide risk assessment by a research clinical psychologist blinded to the indicators who will assign the participant to a criterion reference risk group: Negligible, Mild-Moderate, or High risk. Participants will be followed for 24 weeks after the visit to assess suicidal behavior, our secondary outcome. In Aim 1, we will derive a universal screening decision rule for “all comers,” as well as a variant to be used with patients presenting with a psychiatric chief complaint (targeted). In Aim 2, we will test whether a previously validated risk stratification algorithm using data from the electronic health record improves the performance of the decision rules. In Aim 3, we will model the potential operational impact of the rules through dynamic modeling of clinical workflow and economic costs and assessing clinician and patient acceptability in a new sample of 100 ED clinician-patient dyads. Environment: UMass has demonstrated its capability to support this study through several key preliminary studies, including the ED-SAFE studies, System of Safety, and other suicide-related studies set in the ED. Impact: By providing clear, evidence-based recommendations on universal screening and optimized workflow using standards accepted by emergency clinicians, this study will address two pivotal barriers to universal suicide risk screening, transforming the “right thing” into the “easy thing” so it becomes the “usual thing.” NARRATIVE Effective prevention of suicide among adult emergency department (ED) patients hinges on two indispensable components: effective identification of all patients who are at risk for suicidal behavior, and successful delivery of effective interventions to those with risk. Because many ED patients have hidden risk and do not present with psychiatric chief complaints, universal screening has been recommended by several prominent groups, such as the Joint Commission and the Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention; however, two trenchant barriers prevent such universal screening from being widely implemented, namely, (1) lack of clarity around the specific indicators to use for screening and (2) fear that screening all-comers will cause ED workflow to come to a grinding halt because of surges in psychiatric evaluations and boarding. The proposed study will address these two barriers by deriving the first clinical decision rule for use with all ED patients using rigorous standards and procedures and modelling its impact on workflow and costs, thereby revolutionizing the field's ability to actualize the first indispensable component of suicide prevention: effective, efficient identification and triaging of suicide risk, both hidden and obvious.",Deriving a Clinical Decision Rule for Suicide Risk in the Emergency Department Setting,10130714,R01MH118220,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Consultations ', ' Economic Models ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Medicine ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' indexing ', ' Industrialization ', ' Inpatients ', ' Interview ', ' Joints ', ' Literature ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Psychologist ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' Triage ', ' Measures ', ' Emergency Nursing ', ' ED Nursing ', ' ED nurse ', ' ER Nursing ', ' ER nurse ', ' Emergency Department nurse ', ' Emergency Room Nursing ', ' Emergency nurse ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' economic evaluation ', ' economic analysis ', ' Blinded ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Published Comment ', ' Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' In Situ ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' Performance ', ' Informatics ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' healthcare economics ', ' health care economics ', ' economic cost ', ' Cervical Vertebrae ', ' Cervical spine ', ' blunt force trauma ', ' Blunt Trauma ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Research Training ', ' Stratification ', ' Sum ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Screening Result ', ' Validation ', ' trend ', ' Derivation procedure ', ' Derivation ', ' electronic data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Behavioral ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' evidence based guidelines ', ' Evidence based practice guidelines ', ' evidence based recommendations ', ' suicidal patient ', ' suicide patient ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' secondary outcome ', ' clinical practice ', ' common rule ', ' screening ', ' Emergency Department patient ', ' ED patient ', ' ER patient ', ' Emergency Room patient ', ' Emergency Department-based Intervention ', ' ED-based intervention ', ' Emergency Department Physician ', ' ED Physician ', ' ER physician ', ' Emergency Physician ', ' Emergency room physician ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' Industry Standard ', ' inferential statistics ', ' Research Assistant ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' Self-Direction ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' implementation barriers ', ' implementation challenges ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2021,231701,MA-02
"Developing Suicide Risk Algorithms for Diverse Clinical Settings using Data Fusion Suicide is one of the most serious public health problems facing the United States. Recent evidence indicates that many if not most of individuals who die by suicide have been in contact with the healthcare system in the months prior to their death, providing data that can be used to identify patients at risk prior to an attempt. The proposed project will develop an innovative method for identifying patients at risk of suicidal behavior using data from a large multistate health information exchange, integrated with data from the State of Connecticut’s CHIME hospital database. We will develop and test suicide risk algorithms using principles associated with transfer learning, in which information from a comprehensive external data source is used to improve prediction in a more limited dataset. Specifically, we will use multimodal data fusion techniques to develop and test algorithms that can identify patients at risk of suicidal behavior by clinicians in hospitals with limited numbers of patients, select patient populations, and lack of access to outpatient data. This approach is not only generalizable to hospitals throughout the US but can be extended to very diverse clinical settings, e.g., primary and specialty care practices, community health centers, urgent care clinics. The potential public health significance of this study is substantial. The fragmentation of the healthcare system, particularly in relation to patients’ behavioral health needs, highlights the critical need to cultivate comprehensive, system-wide approaches to identifying and managing at patients at risk of suicide. Narrative Suicide is one of the most serious public health problems facing the United States.

"Accessing the impact of youth suicide prevention program in small communities Project Summary/Abstract Suicide is a leading cause of death in the United States, particularly among youth aged 10–24 years. Youth in smaller, more rural communities, particularly American Indian/Native American youth, face heightened risk. Developing and delivering effective suicide prevention programs requires the means to rigorously evaluate their impact. Conducting impact evaluations of suicide prevention programs faces many challenges common to other fields, such as the difficulty in estimating the counterfactual when randomization is not feasible. These challenges are further compounded by the difficulty of obtaining reliable estimates of suicide rates in communities and segments of the population with heightened risk due to the small size of such communities. Building on small area estimation techniques, Bayesian disease-mapping models were developed to improve estimation of disease or health outcome rates in small areas by borrowing information from neighboring areas. Despite their potential, these models have not been applied to program impact evaluation. This study has three aims: (1) examine a method to assess suicide prevention impact in small areas with heightened suicide risk; (2) identify particular conditions under which our proposed method can outperform alternative methods for impact evaluation; and (3) extend earlier assessments of the impact of the Garrett Lee Smith (GLS) Memorial youth suicide prevention program administered by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration by focusing on small, high-risk communities, such as tribal communities, that were underrepresented in previous study samples. This study will use both simulated and real data to empirically assess the accuracy of the proposed approach vis-à-vis three alternative methods to estimate impact: synthetic control, elastic net, and matrix completion. The simulated data will allow us to gauge how different levels of spatial and temporal dependence, as well as variations in other relevant parameters, affect the relative performance of approaches. Finally, we will use a sample of micropolitan and noncore communities exposed to the GLS program between 2006 and 2018 to estimate the impact of the GLS program on both suicide and self-harm hospitalization rates among youth. In sum, by applying Bayesian spatiotemporal models to suicide prevention impact evaluation, we expect to both extend the utility of the approach beyond disease mapping and advance the ability to understand suicide prevention programming impact in some of the highest-risk populations. Project Narrative When evaluating suicide prevention programs, the difficulty of obtaining reliable estimates of the outcome of interest in small communities and among segments of the population with heightened risk, including youth in rural communities or American Indian/Native American youth, compounds the usual challenges associated with assessing the impact of an intervention. We propose a novel approach for suicide prevention impact assessment in such settings, based on recent developments in Bayesian disease mapping, and will examine the performance of the approach using both simulated and real data from the Garrett Lee Smith youth suicide prevention program evaluation funded by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. If our findings reveal our approach to be accurate, this will provide an improved method to assess suicide prevention programming impact and will extend previous demonstrated impact findings to high-risk populations.",Accessing the impact of youth suicide prevention program in small communities,10213274,R03MH123905,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Risk ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ', ' SAMHSA ', ' Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ', ' County ', ' Estimation Techniques ', ' Self-Injurious Behavior ', ' Deliberate Self-Harm ', ' deliberate self harm ', ' intentional self harm ', ' intentional self injury ', ' self harm ', ' self injury ', ' Rural Community ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Native Americans ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Dependence ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' Performance ', ' Prevention program ', ' Alaska Indian ', ' Alaskan American ', ' Alaskan Indian ', ' Alaskan Native ', ' Alaskan Native American ', ' Alaska Native ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Sum ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' community intervention ', ' tribal community ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Impact evaluation ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' high risk ', ' population based ', ' public health priorities ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' rural Americans ', ' hospitalization rates ', ' ']",NIMH,"ICF MACRO, INC.",R03,2021,73629,VA-11
