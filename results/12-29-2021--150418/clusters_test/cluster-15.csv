"Integrative chemical-biological profiling to determine primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity PROJECT SUMMARY  Wildfire occurrence, duration, and intensity have heightened in recent decades and continue to impact the health of millions of individuals worldwide. Smoke that is emitted from wildfires consists of a complex mixture of particulate matter and toxic gases. The chemical composition of wildfire smoke is dependent upon the type of biomass burn conditions and fuel type, which are heavily influenced by geographical region. The chemical mixtures within wildfire smoke that humans are exposed to can consequently cause variable health outcomes through potentially different biological mechanisms. Human exposure to wildfire smoke represents a growing concern in public health, and adequately characterizing health risks associated with biomass smoke across varying burn conditions and geographic areas is not possible with the data currently available.  The variabilities in toxicological responses across wildfire smoke exposure conditions have yet to be fully established and evaluated in the context of chemical composition. The growing threat of wildfires necessitates the elucidation of individual and/or co-occurring components of wildfire smoke that act as the primary drivers of toxicity. To address this important research issue, we expand upon a foundational study that has previously characterized the chemical constituents in various biomass burn scenarios and evaluated, in part, toxicological responses to these exposures in the mouse lung. Here, we leverage this extensive database and banked samples to: 1. characterize in vivo transcriptomic responses and pathway alterations associated with biomass smoke in the mouse lung; 2. integrate chemical-toxicity profiles using computational approaches to prioritize chemicals that are likely driving toxicity responses; and 3. further evaluate chemical drivers of biomass smoke toxicity responses using in vitro approaches.  This research will be carried out through a collaboration with laboratories at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, allowing for a unique combination of expertise for studying the primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity. This expertise includes skills in computational toxicology, exposure science, and molecular biology, coupled with experience studying adverse health effects and immune responses induced by exposure to air pollutants. PROJECT NARRATIVE Exposure to wildfire smoke continues to be a growing threat to public health, yet the primary drivers of toxicity and disease are not completely understood. This proposal represents an innovative approach to increase understanding on the health effects of wildfires by leveraging a robust dataset of chemical-biological profiles from mice exposed to biomass smoke condensate samples derived from variable conditions. New data will also be generated alongside additional in vitro testing to more comprehensively examine mechanisms of toxicity and identify the primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity, resulting in improved abilities to predict region- specific health risks attributable to wildfires.",Integrative chemical-biological profiling to determine primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity,10146388,R21ES031740,"['Affect ', ' Air ', ' Air Pollutants ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biomass ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Analytical Chemistry ', ' Analytic Chemistry ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA Damage ', ' DNA Injury ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Gases ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Inflammation ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' disease of the lung ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' North Carolina ', ' Phenotype ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Smoke ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Toxicology ', ' United States Environmental Protection Agency ', ' Environmental Protection Agency ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Chemicals ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' smoke inhalation ', ' lung injury ', ' Lung damage ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Collaborations ', ' Critical Pathways ', ' Critical Paths ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' respiratory ', ' Inhalation Exposure ', ' experience ', ' genotoxicity ', ' toxicant ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Lung Parenchyma ', ' Lung Tissue ', ' Structure of parenchyma of lung ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Toxicogenomics ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Chemically Induced Toxicity ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' data integration ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' transcriptomics ', ' Wildfire ', ' exposed human population ', ' human exposure ', ' public health relevance ', ' in vitro testing ', ' data reduction ', ' biomass smoke ', ' biomass fuel ', ' protein biomarkers ', ' protein markers ', ' computational toxicology ', ' Inhalation ', ' Inhaling ', ' asthma exacerbation ', ' asthma attack ', ' exacerbation in asthma ', ' exacerbation prone asthma ', ' exacerbation prone asthmatic ', ' data repository ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2021,190241,NC-04
"Causal machine learning methods for studying the effects of environmental exposures on childhood cancer using natural experiments Project Summary: My goal is to build an independent research program in the development of causal inference methods for investigating environmental causes of childhood cancer. This K01 will enable me to conduct the focused, intensive research that will lay the groundwork for that program and to acquire the environmental, biological, and epidemiological training needed to maximize the rigor and impact of my work. Research: We propose to develop new causal machine learning (ML) methods that enable rigorous analysis of environmental natural experiments (NE) for estimation of the causal effects of environmental exposures on childhood cancer. Classical approaches to studying relationships between environmental exposures and childhood cancer are plagued with challenges and are yielding inconsistent findings. We contend that the recent proliferation of local environmental regulatory programs has created ample relevant NEs, which provide a powerful alternative approach to study these relationships. However, existing methods for NE analysis are poorly-suited for environmental health contexts. In particular, existing methods fail in the presence of rare outcomes like childhood cancer (Aim 1), and they are not able to provide insight into the timing at which children are most susceptible to any adverse exposure effects (Aim 2). We propose causal ML methods that overcome these challenges and apply them to a NE to study the effects of traffic-related air toxics on childhood leukemia. We also provide open source software implementing these methods (Aim 3). Career Development and Training: Given my extensive prior training and experience in statistics and data science, the primary aim of the training funded by this award will be the acquisition of subject-matter proficiency, which will provide me with the insights needed to create more effective and impactful environmental health methods. Specifically, I will pursue knowledge in the biology and epidemiology of childhood cancer and in environmental health and exposure biology. The training will be achieved through a combination of (1) hands-on collaborative research as described above; (2) intensive cross-disciplinary mentorship, with mentors specializing in environmental health, pediatric oncology, cancer biology and epidemiology, and statistics; (3) carefully-selected coursework in the Departments of Epidemiology, Environmental Health, and Cell Biology at Harvard; and (4) relevant conferences, workshops, and seminars. I will place special emphasis on establishing a network of expert collaborators in all my areas of training. Environment: The Harvard Medical Campus is home to the top research teams worldwide in both childhood cancer and environmental health. Due to Harvard’s position at the forefront of scientific discovery in these fields, its unparalleled resources, its vibrant intellectual atmosphere, and its promotion of collaborative science that integrates knowledge across disciplines, it provides an ideal environment in which to train on these topics. Project Narrative: Decades of research on the relationship between environmental exposures and childhood cancer, relying on classic epidemiologic study designs, has produced a largely inconclusive body of literature, and has generated little robust, actionable evidence to protect children’s health. We propose an alternative methodological approach to this problem, which relies on environmental natural experiments to overcome many of the challenges presented by classic approaches. We develop causal machine learning methods tailored to this setting, which provide a promising new avenue for obtaining robust evidence about environmental causes of childhood cancer, and we apply the methods to study the effects of exposure to traffic-related air toxics on childhood leukemia.",Causal machine learning methods for studying the effects of environmental exposures on childhood cancer using natural experiments,10104187,K01ES032458,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Air ', ' Award ', ' Benzene ', ' Benzol ', ' Benzole ', ' Cyclohexatriene ', ' Biology ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Foundations ', ' Gasoline ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Incidence ', ' Learning ', ' leukemia ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Occupational Exposure ', ' workplace exposure ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Societies ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' statistics ', ' Time ', ' United States Environmental Protection Agency ', ' Environmental Protection Agency ', ' Work ', ' 1,3-Butadiene ', ' divinyl ', ' Measures ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Discipline ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Funding ', ' Malignant Childhood Neoplasm ', ' Childhood Cancers ', ' Malignant Childhood Tumor ', ' Malignant Pediatric Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Pediatric Tumor ', ' Malignant childhood cancer ', ' cancer in a child ', ' cancer in children ', ' child with cancer ', ' childhood malignancy ', ' children with cancer ', ' pediatric cancer ', ' pediatric malignancy ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' environmental agent ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' cell biology ', ' Cellular biology ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' experience ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' cancer registry ', ' neoplasm registry ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' cancer epidemiology ', ' Pediatric Leukemia ', ' children with leukemia ', ' leukemia in children ', ' Childhood Leukemia ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' Pediatric Oncology ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Outcome ', ' Natural experiment ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' health application ', ' user-friendly ', ' open source ', ' usability ', ' health data ', ' educational atmosphere ', ' classroom environment ', ' college atmosphere ', ' collegial atmosphere ', ' collegiate atmosphere ', ' education atmosphere ', ' educational environment ', ' intellectual atmosphere ', ' learning atmosphere ', ' learning environment ', ' school atmosphere ', ' school climate ', ' training atmosphere ', ' university atmosphere ', ' Data Science ', ' Time trend ', ' Temporal trend ', ' Trends over time ', ' Child Health ', ' Bayesian learning ', ' Bayesian machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIEHS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K01,2021,138538,MA-07
"Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs PROJECT SUMMARY Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important public health outcomes. Loss of functioning early in life due to toxins, such as metals, can have lifelong impacts. The prevention of neurodevelopmental disorders of fetal origin is impeded by the lack of objective tools for early detection of susceptible individuals. We will address the role of prenatal metal exposure on neurodevelopment, integrating this work with the overall goal of understanding how metal exposures impact placental cues, specifically release of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which facilitate and direct neurodevelopment. It has been shown that placental trophoblasts actively release EVs, i.e., nano-sized membrane-bound vesicles, in both the maternal and fetal circulation. EVs shuttle cargoes of bioactive molecules from trophoblasts to recipient cells, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) that prime maternal tissues to support fetal development. In the fetal circulation, EVs can cross the blood-brain barrier, particularly in prenatal life when the barrier around the fetal brain is still porous and permeable. Not only is the placenta a primary target of metal toxicities, data show that EV signaling is sensitive to environmental influences, including metals. No study to date has investigated whether exposures to metals during the prenatal period determine alterations of circulating EV signals that, in turn, may help to diagnose and predict alterations in neurodevelopment. Notably, many placental miRNAs are known to regulate neurodevelopment and have significant overrepresentation of Gene Ontology terms associated with neurogenesis. We propose that in utero metal exposure disrupt normal miRNA expression in placental tissue and their release in circulating EVs, thus altering neural stem cell proliferation, self-renewal and differentiation during fetal development. In turn, we propose that EV-packaged miRNAs in the maternal circulation in pregnancy reflect early biological settings of this fetal programming. We will conduct a coordinated series of human studies and in-vitro experiments to: 1) characterize the risk for maladaptive neurodevelopment from prenatal exposure to toxic metals and their mixtures; 2) identify EV-encapsulated miRNAs released by the placenta in response to metals by accessing this novel form of prenatal signaling through a maternal blood draw during pregnancy, cord blood, and placental biopsy at birth; and 3) conduct in-vitro experiments to assess whether EV-encapsulated miRNAs are released by trophoblasts after treatment with individual metals or their mixtures; and whether miRNAs in EVs released from metal-treated trophoblasts alter critical functions of neural stem cells. We leverage the PRogramming of Intergenerational Stress Mechanisms (PRISM) cohort with prospective assessment of behavioral disinhibition in N=470 children followed to age 48 months. While we propose underlying theoretical pathways, the primary goal is to search for biomarkers of early risk. However, findings may also advance our understanding of molecular pathways that influence neurodevelopmental risk, which will be critical for the development of preventative strategies and possible therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal integrates experimental and clinical research on in utero metal exposures, molecular epigenetic biomarkers of placental origin and neurobehavior to create novel, cutting edge cross disciplinary research on neuroprogramming. This is a significant research advance that has the potential to identify early pregnancy biomarkers of placental/fetal health and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms that identify those at heightened risk from environmental exposures, so that interventions may be applied early to promote optimal development and improved health.",Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs,10163057,R01ES030302,"['Accounting ', ' Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Arsenic ', ' Atlases ', ' Behavior ', ' Biopsy ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Circulation ', ' Blood -

"Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats (PROTECT) PROJECT SUMMARY Evidence suggests that exposure to Superfund chemicals contributes to adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs), including preterm birth (PTB). Rates of PTB and infant mortality in Puerto Rico (PR) are among the highest of all US states and territories. There are 18 Superfund sites in PR, and evidence of contamination of the drinking water is extensive. Moreover, extreme weather events (hurricanes, flooding) may result in elevated exposures to Superfund chemicals. The PROTECT center has brought together researchers from Northeastern University, the University of Puerto Rico, University of Georgia, and the University of Michigan to provide much needed understanding of the relationship and the mechanisms by which exposure to suspect chemicals contribute to APOs, and to develop new methods to reduce risk of exposure in PR and beyond. To do this, PROTECT uses a source-to-outcome structure, integrating epidemiological (Project 1), toxicological (Project 2), fate and transport (Project 3), and remediation (Project 4) studies, a unified sampling infrastructure, a centralized indexed data repository, and a sophisticated data management system. Since its inception in 2010, PROTECT has built detailed and extensive data sets on environmental conditions and prenatal conditions of 1457 pregnant mothers (exposure, socioeconomic and health data–close to 3000 data points per participant), yielding a cohort of 1210 live births in northern PR. In the renewal, PROTECT will recruit and follow an additional 1000 study participants, yielding a cohort of 800+ live births for an ultimate total cohort of 2000+ completed live births. PROTECT has documented significant contamination of northern PR drinking water and has found compelling preliminary epidemiologic and mechanistic toxicology associations between Superfund chemicals and APOs. PROTECT research has focused on chlorinated volatile organic compounds and phthalates and their role in PTB. The PROTECT renewal will broaden its scope, employing a data-driven approach to study and reduce the impact of exposure to mixtures of suspect chemicals from Superfund sites in karst regions on APOs in Puerto Rico’s underserved, highly-exposed population. Target chemicals will be expanded to include metals, pesticides, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. We will investigate the impacts of extreme weather events on contaminant transport and exposure, and new water treatment technologies will be developed for portable and robust water treatment systems. The PROTECT renewal will also focus on oxidative stress as an underlying biological pathway by which contaminant exposure can lead to APOs. New statistical methods and data mining, machine learning, and visualization tools will be developed to allow PROTECT researchers to analyze our datasets. PROTECT will employ innovative approaches to engage and educate the community, involve study participants, report- back data, and communicate with stakeholders. A broad suite of training and professional activities will be provided to trainees, individually tailored to the trainees’ needs and goals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Reproductive health has been at the forefront of Puerto Ricans’ health concerns as rates of preterm birth and infant mortality in Puerto Rico are among the highest of all U.S. states and territories. The PROTECT SRC is exploring the link between exposure to a mixture of suspect chemicals from Superfund sites and adverse pregnancy outcomes in Puerto Rico, and is working to reduce that exposure. Improved understanding of the link between adverse pregnancy outcomes and contamination, together with developing sustainable technologies to reduce risk, will help improve health outcomes in Puerto Rico (a disadvantaged population) and beyond.",Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats (PROTECT),10128453,P42ES017198,"['Awareness ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Communication ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Pollution ', ' environmental contaminant ', ' environmental contamination ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Floods ', ' Flooding ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hurricane ', ' indexing ', ' Infant Mortality ', ' Infant Mortality Total ', ' Premature Infant ', ' infants born premature ', ' infants born prematurely ', ' premature baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' preterm baby ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm infant human ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Metals ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' Pesticides ', ' Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons ', ' polyaromatic hydrocarbons ', ' polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' expectant mother ', ' expecting mother ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' Public Health Practice ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' sound ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' tissue culture ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Toxicology ', ' Universities ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Work ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Mediating ', ' phthalates ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Premature Birth ', ' Prematurely delivering ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' premature childbirth ', ' premature delivery ', ' preterm delivery ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Logistics ', ' Policies ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' Water Purification ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Exposure to ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Live Birth ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' groundwater ', ' ground water ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' water treatment ', ' contaminant transport ', ' drinking water ', ' cohort ', ' toxicant ', ' Structure ', ' Chemical Exposure ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' portability ', ' superfund chemical ', ' superfund site ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' US State ', ' Geographic state ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Data ', ' Sum ', ' in vitro Model ', ' Environmental Epidemiology ', ' Oxidative Stress Pathway ', ' Oxidative Stress Induced Gene Expression Via Nrf2 ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' remediation ', ' Visualization software ', ' visualization tool ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' volatile organic compound ', ' volatile organic chemical ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Superfund ', ' health data ', ' data visualization ', ' contaminated water ', ' Water contamination ', ' contaminated drinking water ', ' drinking water contamination ', ' adverse pregnancy outcome ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' recruit ', ' human model ', ' model of human ', ' Infrastructure ', ' multidimensional data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' community involvement ', ' Data Management Resources ', ' Data Management System ', ' extreme weather ', ' data repository ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' community engagement ', ' ']",NIEHS,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,P42,2021,2152873,MA-07
"The Impact of Drought on Arsenic Exposure and Cardiometabolic Outcomes in a Rural Aging Population Project Summary / Abstract Droughts are an important natural disaster but the health implications for elderly populations in the United States have not been extensively studied. This study seeks to provide evidence on the cardiometabolic health risks posed by drought. Droughts can contribute to groundwater over-pumping, and this may in turn lead to arsenic release from aquifer clays into drinking water sources. The impacts of drought on arsenic exposure and resultant health outcomes in human populations are potentially important and this study seeks to address that knowledge gap. We propose to conduct a retrospective cohort study using data from the San Luis Valley Diabetes Study, as well as hydrogeological measurements of water and environmental conditions in the San Luis Valley, to clarify relationships between drought, arsenic in water, arsenic exposure (as measured by urine biomarker), and cardiometabolic health outcomes including incident diabetes (DM), incident cardiovascular disease (CVD), and all-cause mortality. This work is community-engaged and includes a K12 outreach component. Aim 1 quantifies the relationship of drought to individual arsenic exposures and thence to incident CVD, incident DM, and mortality. Aim 2 generates a model for groundwater arsenic as a function of hydrological predictors using machine learning approaches, and uses this to explore relationships between drought, modeled water arsenic and the outcomes of Aim 1. Aim 3 estimates the association between cumulative arsenic exposure and incident CVD, incident DM, and mortality, using a nested case-control design and predictions over time of arsenic exposure from the Aim 2 model. Aim 4 is a simulation study projecting future CVD and DM outcomes under different scenarios of drought conditions, with and without counterfactual interventions to reduce drinking water arsenic. Project Narrative This community-engaged project in San Luis Valley, Colorado seeks to identify cardiometabolic disease risks posed by drought through arsenic for elderly Hispanic and non-Hispanic white adult men and women, through interdisciplinary team science bringing together hydrogeological and epidemiological modeling.",The Impact of Drought on Arsenic Exposure and Cardiometabolic Outcomes in a Rural Aging Population,10299821,R01ES032612,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Arsenic ', ' California ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Climate ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Colorado ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Droughts ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Future ', ' Geology ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Literature ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Natural Disasters ', ' Nested Case-Control Study ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Time ', ' Toxicology ', ' United States ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' clay ', ' Measures ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Hispanics ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Mediating ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' density ', ' Pump ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Source ', ' Visit ', ' meetings ', ' empowered ', ' groundwater ', ' ground water ', ' water quality ', ' participatory sensing ', ' remote sensing ', ' water conservation ', ' drinking water ', ' cohort ', ' simulation ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' outreach ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' case control ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' K12 ', ' SECTM1 ', ' Secreted and Transmembrane 1 ', ' SECTM1 gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' intervention for prevention ', ' prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' preventive intervention ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' sex ', ' cost ', ' epidemiological model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' climate change ', ' global climate change ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Plug-in ', ' hydrology ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' aging population ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' Medicare claim ', ' population based ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' STEM career ', ' STEM workforce ', ' science, technology, engineering and math career ', ' science, technology, engineering and math workforce ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics career ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics workforce ', ' Learning Module ', ' Education Module ', ' Educational Module ', ' Teaching Module ', ' exposure pathway ', ' Retrospective cohort study ', ' secondary analysis ', ' cardiometabolism ', ' cardiometabolic ', ' biological sex ', ' extreme weather ', ' Cardiometabolic Disease ', ' Cardiometabolic Disorder ', ' weather-related disaster ', ' weather disaster ', ' geochemistry ', ' geochemical ', ' community engaged research ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2021,671536,CO-06
"BRINGING MODERN DATA SCIENCE TOOLS TO BEAR ON ENVIRONMENTAL MIXTURES Project Summary: Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures Environmental exposures often cumulate in particular geographies, and the nature of the complex mixtures that characterize these exposures remains understudied. In addition, adverse environmental exposures often occur in communities facing multiple social stressors such as deteriorating housing, inadequate access to health care, poor schools, high unemployment, crime, and poverty – all of which may compound the effects of environmental exposures. Our central objective is to develop new data architecture, statistical, and machine learning methods to assess how exposure to environmental mixtures shapes educational outcomes in the presence or absence of social stress. We focus on air pollution mixtures, childhood lead exposure, and social stressors. We will implement our proposed work in North Carolina (NC), a state characterized by diverse environmental features, industrial activities, and airsheds typified by varying pollution emission sources and resulting pollutant mixtures. To accomplish this central objective, we will first develop, document, and disseminate methods for building space-time environmental and social data architectures. We will implement this for all of NC, incorporating data on air pollution, lead exposure risk, and social exposures from 1990-2015+ (dataset 1). Second, we will refine methods for linking unrelated datasets to build a space-time child movement and outcome data architecture (dataset 2). Third, we will connect exposures (dataset 1) and outcomes (dataset 2) data via shared geography and temporality into a single, comprehensive geodatabase. Fourth, we will implement increasingly complex methods to assess the effect of environmental mixtures in the presence or absence of social stressors on early childhood educational outcomes. We will document and disseminate all of the underlying methodological work via public website. The proposed work leverages a rich array of data resources already available to the investigators (with some significantly post-processed) and allows tracking of children across space and time. Our team brings tools from modern data science (hierarchical Bayesian methods with variable selection, spatial point process models, machine learning) to bear on the critical question of how environmental mixtures shape child outcomes directly and differentially in the presence of social stress. Project Narrative Environmental exposure mixtures, especially when coupled with social stressors, have the potential to compromise developmental outcomes in children, but have been understudied. We will use a unique longitudinal dataset that tracks children from birth through early elementary school, in combination with new tools from modern data science, to disentangle the complex effects of these mixtures on educational outcomes.",BRINGING MODERN DATA SCIENCE TOOLS TO BEAR ON ENVIRONMENTAL MIXTURES,10304211,R01ES028819,"['Air ', ' Air Pollutants ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Biological Availability ', ' Bioavailability ', ' Biologic Availability ', ' Physiologic Availability ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Birth Records ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Carbon Monoxide ', ' Censuses ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Communities ', ' Cox Models ', ' Crime ', ' Data Sources ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Geography ', ' Housing ', ' indexing ', ' Industrialization ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' Mothers ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nitrogen Dioxide ', ' NO2 ', ' Nitrogen Peroxide ', ' North Carolina ', ' Ozone ', ' O3 ', ' Particle Size ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Poverty ', ' Impoverished ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' pre-k ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' preschool ', ' Siblings ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Sulfur Dioxide ', ' Sulfurous Anhydride ', ' Taxes ', ' Time ', ' Unemployment ', ' jobless ', ' joblessness ', ' out of work ', ' unemployed ', ' Work ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Bayesian Method ', ' Bayesian Methodology ', ' Bayesian Statistical Method ', ' Bayesian approaches ', ' Bayesian classification method ', ' Bayesian classification procedure ', ' Bayesian posterior distribution ', ' Relative Risks ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Pollution ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' grade school ', ' elementary school ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' pollutant ', ' simulation ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' socially stressed ', ' social stress ', ' deprivation ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Output ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' lead exposure ', ' Exposure to Pb2+ ', ' Pb exposed ', ' Pb exposure ', ' Pb2+ Exposure ', ' Pb2+ exposed ', ' exposed to lead ', ' exposure to Pb ', ' exposure to lead ', ' lead exposed ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Gaussian model ', ' Gaussian statistics ', ' Gaussianity ', ' Gaussianity model ', ' Data Science ', ' health care availability ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' data resource ', ' rural environment ', ' urban setting ', ' urban environment ', ' Child Health ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' social stressor ', ' social stresses ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2021,487253,IN-02
"Adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with systemic lupus erythematosus: improving and validating risk prediction ABSTRACT: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) predominantly affects women during reproductive years, raising concerns regarding maternal and fetal health during pregnancy. Although physicians no longer uniformly discourage women with SLE from childbearing, patients face 20% likelihood of adverse pregnancy outcomes (APO), including preeclampsia, fetal and neonatal death, growth restriction, and preterm delivery, even during clinical disease quiescence. Because there are no established instruments to predict APO in individual patients, SLE pregnancies are intensely monitored at an emotional cost to patients and financial burden to society. The ability to identify, early in pregnancy, patients at high risk of APO would significantly enhance our capacity to clinically manage patients. Furthermore, validated risk stratification models are needed to design and execute trials to prevent APOs. In PROMISSE, the largest multi-center, multi-ethnic and multi-racial study of pregnant SLE patients to date, several risk factors were identified as significant predictors of APO. Although a major advance, these results have neither been externally validated nor shown to generalize to independent study populations. Moreover, risk factors were identified using standard statistical models that did not fully account for complex effects of multiple predictor variables. In this project, an international team of SLE, obstetric and biostatistics researchers, led by PROMISSE investigators, will rigorously develop and externally validate an APO prediction model by leveraging data from PROMISSE (N=447), as well as five independent cohorts of lupus patients from different countries (total N = 979). In Aim 1, powerful machine learning algorithms will be applied to PROMISSE data to create an accurate and clinically useful model to predict APOs in SLE patients. To maximize utility of this model in the real world, only clinical and laboratory features that are routinely and accurately assessed on SLE patients during clinical care will be considered as potential predictors. In Aim 2, the APO model will be externally validated in prospective cohorts of pregnant lupus patients from Europe (France: N=246; Germany: N=180; Norway: N=349) and regions in the US, not included in PROMISSE (South Carolina: N=82; Bronx, NY: N=122). These cohorts are heterogeneous with respect to race, ethnicity, socioeconomic strata, and SLE disease activity, allowing for a thorough investigation into generalizability and transportability of the APO model to diverse lupus patient populations. In each cohort, detailed baseline and longitudinal clinical, laboratory and pregnancy outcome data have been obtained using procedures similar to those in PROMISSE. The overarching goal is development of an online risk calculator that will significantly improve real world clinical decision making and enable risk stratification for future APO prevention trials. Impact: An accurate, validated, and user-friendly prediction model for APO is necessary for effective clinical care of pregnant lupus patients, optimal allocation of healthcare resources, and the design of and recruitment to future clinical trials of experimental interventions to prevent APO. Project Narrative Pregnancies in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are at increased risk for poor outcomes, such as very premature delivery, fetal death or growth restriction, yet there are no validated instruments to predict pregnancy outcomes in individual patients and focus care on those most likely to have serious complications. Our proposal is to develop and validate a prediction model that can be used to identify, early in pregnancy, SLE patients at high risk for adverse outcomes. This tool will significantly enhance the capacity to manage these patients, optimize allocation of healthcare resources, and design and conduct trials of new treatments to prevent the placental insufficiency that can result in poor outcomes.",Adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with systemic lupus erythematosus: improving and validating risk prediction,10248288,R21AR076612,"['Affect ', ' Angiogenic Factor ', ' Angiogenesis Factor ', ' Antihypertensive Agents ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Agents ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Drugs ', ' Anti-Hypertensives ', ' Antihypertensive Drugs ', ' Antihypertensives ', ' Hypotensive Agent ', ' Hypotensive Drugs ', ' Hypotensives ', ' Autoantibodies ', ' autoimmune antibody ', ' autoreactive antibody ', ' self reactive antibody ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Blood Platelets ', ' Marrow platelet ', ' Platelets ', ' Thrombocytes ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complement Activation ', ' complement pathway regulation ', ' Conceptions ', ' Financial cost ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Europe ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Fetal Death ', ' fetus death ', ' Fetal Growth Retardation ', ' Fetal Growth Restriction ', ' IUGR ', ' Intrauterine Growth Retardation ', ' impaired fetal growth ', ' intra-uterine growth restriction ', ' intra-uterine growth retardation ', ' intrauterine growth restriction ', ' prenatal growth disorder ', ' Fetus ', ' France ', ' Future ', ' Germany ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Laboratories ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ', ' Lupus Erythematosus Disseminatus ', ' SLE ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematous ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythmatosus ', ' disseminated lupus erythematosus ', ' systemic lupus erythematosis ', ' Maternal Health ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Morbidity -

"Dissecting the pathogenesis and outcomes of PSC using multi-omics by studying the exposome and genome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The major goal of this RC2 proposal is to generate the first, multi-omics translational study capturing the sum of environmental exposures (i.e. the exposome) and comprehensive data resource for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a chronic, progressive liver disease without effective medical therapy. PSC shortens survival, is associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and strongly predisposes to cholangiocarcinoma (i.e. bile duct cancer) and colon cancer. Our recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) revealed the significant role of genetic variation in PSC, while also re-emphasizing the importance of environmental factors and gene-environment interactions in PSC pathogenesis. To further elucidate the role of exposures from our external environment and lifestyle (e.g., diet, stress, toxins, drugs, microbes), we have assembled a world-class, multi-disciplinary team that synergizes expertise and resources across four institutions: Mayo Clinic, Emory University, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), and University of Oslo, Norway. Our collaborative team will leverage large clinical databases and biorepositories, as well as expertise in PSC and related conditions, exposomics, metabolomics, methylomics, transcriptomics, metagenomics, genomics, and data analytics to develop the PSC Scientific Community Resource for hypothesis-generating science and simultaneously uncover factors contributing to PSC.  We now seek to define the bigger-picture cellular networks, rather than individual genes, driving disease processes. To do so, we will use unbiased network-based approaches designed to integrate multiple layers of omics data. Our proposal is predicated on the hypothesis that multi-omics analyses of data capturing environmental exposures and the associated biological responses, including the effect on the genome, will reveal networks or pathways influencing PSC pathogenesis and outcomes. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of sophisticated analyses to identify PSC-associated changes in and across the exposome, metabolome, methylome, and transcriptome in blood as well as the gut metagenome, exposome and metabolome.  Our collaboration and data generation are already underway with pilot studies demonstrating differences in blood exposomes and metabolomes and stool metagenomes between PSC patients and controls. Using a suite of bioinformatic tools and available genetic variation data, we aim to discover stable, detectable, omics-based disease signatures in blood (Aim 1) and stool (Aim 2) that when integrated with clinical data (Aim 3) will reveal biological pathways driving disease pathogenesis and outcomes. All data, residual specimens, and analytical details will be made freely available to the research community in accordance with NIDDK's mission. Furthermore, this effort responds to the NIDDK's call “to better understand the role of the microbiome, genetics, and exposome.” PROJECT NARRATIVE We seek to generate the first, multi-omics translational study and comprehensive data resource for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a chronic, progressive liver disease without medical therapy. We will define the bigger-picture cellular networks and gene-environment interactions driving PSC by integrating multiple layers of -omics data. In so doing, we will identify molecular disease signatures, including environmental toxins, metabolism-related chemicals and gut bacteria, unique to PSC patients.",Dissecting the pathogenesis and

"Developing data science solutions to mitigate the health impacts of climate change in Africa: the HE2AT Center HE2AT Center Overall - Project summary/abstract The world's climate is changing rapidly, with global temperatures having risen more than 1°C since the industrial revolution, and a further 0.5°C increase is likely by 2040. Heat waves and rising temperatures have major, though underappreciated, health implications, particularly for vulnerable populations in low-income settings. The overarching objective of the Heat and Health African Transdisciplinary Center (HE2AT Center) is to develop innovative solutions to mitigate the health impacts of climate change in Africa. The consortium of academic and non-academic partners is drawn from across sub-Saharan Africa and from the United States, and constitutes a transdisciplinary group, including heat physiologists, biomedical and climate content experts, public health practitioners, social-behavioral scientists as well as statisticians, and computer and data scientists. The Center will systematically develop a data ecosystem containing biomedical data, integrated with weather, air quality and other environmental data, and other geospatial data within two existing highly- complementary data platforms (IBM-PAIRS and the University of Cape Town). Over five years we will implement two Research Projects and 10-12 Pilot Projects, all streamlined and supported by the Administration, Data Management and Analysis, and Training and Engagement Cores. The first Project will implement an innovative data science approach to characterize the clinical outcomes of heat exposure in pregnant women and neonates. We will reuse data from cohorts and trials among pregnant women and neonates conducted across sub-Saharan Africa since the year 2000. Data from systematically identified studies will be integrated in an Individual Participant Data platform from data repositories and data owners. Then, analyses of relationships between heat exposure and outcomes (preterm birth, birth weight and pre- eclampsia) will inform quantification of heat-related disease burden. Finally, taking all findings together, we will pilot a district-level climate change indicator, the first of its kind. The second Project assesses the burden of heat-related morbidity in vulnerable urban settings using geospatial and heat hazard analyses in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire and Johannesburg, South Africa. This Project uses more complex data and data sources on the built environment and topography, for example, to assess heat-health impacts, and how these vary across urban geographies. Activities will inform development of an Early Warning System, including a digital App that delivers information to people on their forecasted risks of heat-health disease, based on their individualized risk profile, as determined by a machine learning algorithm which takes into account weather conditions, individual characteristics, geolocation and other factors that drive risk. These systems are a central element in heatwave responses, allow for adequate preparations for heat events, which is especially important for vulnerable groups and industry. We will collaborate closely with other Hubs and parts of the DS-I Africa consortium, supporting them to incorporate climate data within their research activities, and vice versa. HE2AT Center Overall - Project Narrative The Heat and Health African Transdisciplinary Center (HE2AT Center) will generate new knowledge on the impacts of heat waves and extreme heat on clinical conditions and on people living in vulnerable urban settings, applying data sciences approaches to existing environmental and high-quality health outcomes data. Perhaps more importantly, the Center will develop and test innovative solutions for tracking heat-related conditions at a district level and for providing individualized early warnings of dangerous heat periods relevant to high-risk groups, industry and the general population. In all Center activities we will build capacity of the team and key organizations, engage with communities, government and other stakeholder, and work across the DS-I Africa Program.",Developing data science solutions to mitigate the health impacts of climate change in Africa: the HE2AT Center,10314149,U54TW012083,"['Africa ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Air ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Birth Weight ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Climate ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' Housing ', ' Industrialization ', ' Industry ', ' Influentials ', ' Ivory Coast ', "" Cote d'Ivoire "", ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Pre-Eclampsia ', ' EPH Gestosis ', ' Preeclampsia ', ' Pregnancy Toxemias ', ' Proteinuria-Edema-Hypertension Gestosis ', ' pregnancy toxemia/hypertension ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' expectant mother ', ' expecting mother ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Software Design ', ' Designing computer software ', ' South Africa ', ' Specificity ', ' Vertebral column ', ' Spinal Column ', ' Spine ', ' backbone ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Temperature ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Support ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Weather ', ' Work ', ' Planets ', ' Premature Birth ', ' Prematurely delivering ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' premature childbirth ', ' premature delivery ', ' preterm delivery ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' base ', ' career ', ' urban area ', ' urban location ', ' urban region ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Policies ', ' Research Activity ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' data management ', ' hazard ', ' computer science ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' social ', ' response ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Institution ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Preparation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' neonate ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' digital ', ' climate change ', ' global climate change ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Heat Waves ', ' heatwave ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' high risk ', ' doctoral student ', ' Ph D student ', ' Ph D. student ', ' Ph.

"ICEES+ Knowledge Provider: Leveraging Open Clinical and Environmental Data to Accelerate and Drive Innovation in Translational Research and Clinical Care. As part of the feasibility phase of the Translator program, we have developed a disease-agnostic framework and approach for openly exposing clinical data that have been integrated at the patient- and visit-level with environmental exposures data: the Integrated Clinical and Environmental Exposures Service (ICEES). We have validated ICEES and demonstrated the service’s ability to replicate and extend published findings on asthma, while also supporting open team science, accelerated translational discovery, and integration with the broader Translator ecosystem. This proposal aims to move ICEES from prototype to development via creation of an ICEES+ Knowledge Provider (KP). Specifically, we aim to address three major challenges that we have identified through research and development (R&D) of the prototype ICEES in an effort to improve the quality, value, and impact of query answers and assertions. Specific Aim 1. Advance the rigor of insights and assertions that ICEES provides. Our prototype ICEES currently provides the ability to dynamically define cohorts and conduct simple statistical associations to examine bivariate relationships between feature variables. Recently, we have identified an approach to extend the bivariate functionalities to support multivariate analysis of the data. For the proposed work, we will apply multivariate analyses, including traditional statistical methods (e.g., regression models) and machine learning methods (e.g., bayesian neural network models, variational autoencoder models), and systematically quantify the extent of data loss and analytic bounds when algorithms are imposed on the ICEES+ KP open application programming interface (API) versus the Institutional Review Board (IRB)– protected, fully identified, pre-binned, underlying integrated feature tables. The overall goal is to provide users with more rigorous insights and estimates of the robustness, validity, accuracy, and specificity of knowledge and assertions generated via the ICEES+ KP OpenAPI. Specific Aim 2. Address issues related to space–time and causality. Clinical and environmental data are inherently spatiotemporal, with observations or events that are contingent on space and time and may be causally related. For the proposed work, we will evaluate and implement technical approaches (e.g., ICEES+ design modifications), spatiotemporal statistical algorithms (e.g., conditional auto-regression), recurrent neural network models, and causal inference models. As part of this effort, we will derive insights from and contribute real-world evidence to support Causal Activity Models and Adverse Outcome Pathways. We also will explore approaches for incorporating into ICEES+ nationwide public data on school exposures—data that will allow us to begin to address patient mobility. Specific Aim 3. Evaluate the security of the ICEES+ KP to ensure that patient privacy is preserved as new capabilities are enabled. ImPACT is an NSF-funded package of tools and services that provides end-to-end infrastructure and support for privacy-assured research and computation on sensitive data. Over the award period, we will implement and evaluate ImPACT security protocols, focusing initially on application of the ImPACT secure multiparty computation (SMC) algorithm as a method to support secure multi-institutional sharing of data on rare diseases and events—a functionality that is not currently supported by ICEES. In addition, we will evaluate other ImPACT security protocols, working under the guidance of a security advisor and in the context of driving use cases and capabilities developed under Specific Aims1 and 2. Importantly, the project aims will be driven by three use cases and associated high-value queries designed to complement and extend our asthma-focused work on the prototype ICEES: (1) an asthma cohort from the Environmental Polymorphism Registry (EPR) at the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS); (2) a primary ciliary disease cohort (PCD) from the UNC PCD Registry; and (3) a drug-induced liver injury (DILI) cohort from the National DILI Network. These use cases will invoke new diseases, new data types, new organ systems, new institutions, and new queries, thereby stress-testing the ICEES framework and approach and moving it from prototype to development as the ICEES+ KP.

"Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior ABSTRACT Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is consistently related to impaired attention and behavioral and physiological self-regulation in infants and young children, suggesting persistent negative impact on skills essential for optimal learning and social competence. Gestational exposure to cocaine occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, which is immediately followed by massive expansion and refinement of brain structure, functional connections and network organization in the first year of life. However, little is known about the effects of PCE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits in cognition and neurobehavior. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of PCE on the developmental trajectory of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 0-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how specific maternal caregiving characteristics (Sensitivity, Harshness) moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by PCE; deficits in developing functional connections mediate the negative effects of PCE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; postnatal maternal behaviors and environment interact with PCE to influence growth trajectories of developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the Co-PIs'strong preliminary data describing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in functional connectivity due to prenatal cocaine and other drugs in neonates (Grewen, Gao), and on Co-investigator Eiden's longitudinal studies of the behavioral effects of PCE and its moderation by maternal behaviors in infants, toddlers and children. We propose to study infant resting state functional connectivity and behavioral development at 2 weeks, 6 months and 12 months in 3 groups of infants: 120 with PCE with or without exposure to other drugs (nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, and/or opiates), 100 exposed to the same other drugs but without cocaine (OD), 100 drug-free (CTL). We will measure Maternal Sensitivity (primary), Maternal Harshness (secondary) and an index of cumulative environmental risk to determine postnatal moderation of PCE effects on developing connectivity. The rationale is that longitudinal study will reveal prenatal drug effects, determine whether the postnatal trajectory of brain functional connections is merely delayed or permanently altered by initial PCE insult, and ascertain postnatal factors contributing to greater risk or resilience in func- tional network development. This innovative approach will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural deficit and postnatal environmental influences on patterns of brain and cognitive development, and will apply hypothesis-driven and data-driven analytic methods, including machine learning, to characterize mechanisms underlying PCE effects on trajectory of brain development. Knowledge gleaned has potential to inform earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce learning and behavioral impairments in this at-risk population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal cocaine and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. It is relevant to public health because discovery of mechanisms by which prenatal cocaine exposure influences development of brain and cognition in infancy will lead to earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce later disabilities, as opposed to treatment in later childhood. This research is relevant to the mission of NIDA because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population— infants exposed in utero.",Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior,10224154,R01DA042988,"['Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Animals ', ' Arousal ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Cocaine ', ' Cognition ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environment ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Infant ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Marijuana ', ' marihuana ', ' Maternal Behavior ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Mothers ', ' Nicotine ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rest ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Glean ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Ventral Tegmental Area ', ' ventral tegmentum ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Lateral ', ' Anterior ', ' Dorsal ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' intraparietal sulcus ', ' disability ', ' infancy ', ' infantile ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Opioid ', ' Opiates ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Parietal ', ' postnatal ', ' Pattern ', ' fetal ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' gestational cocaine exposure ', ' prenatal cocaine exposure ', ' prenatally cocaine exposed ', ' Fetal Cocaine Exposure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Toddler ', ' interpersonal competence ', ' interpersonal competency ', ' social competence ', ' social competency ', ' social skills ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Drug Exposure ', ' exposed in utero ', ' fetal exposure ', ' in utero exposure ', ' intra-uterine environmental exposure ', ' intrauterine environmental exposure ', ' prenatally exposed ', ' prenatal exposure ', ' response ', ' neurobehavior ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Future Generations ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' Cognitive ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' neonate ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' drug of abuse ', ' abused drug ', ' abused drugs ', ' drug abused ', ' drugs abused ', ' drugs of abuse ', ' behavioral impairment ', ' impaired behavior ', ' effective intervention ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' cocaine exposure ', ' cocaine-exposed ', ' exposed to cocaine ', ' exposure to cocaine ', ' learning ability ', ' learning achievement ', ' learning competence ', ' cognitive development ', ' cognitive ability ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' maternal caregiving ', ' maternal care giving ', ' neonatal brain ', ' gender difference ', ' gender-associated difference ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,689816,NC-04
"Evaluating the effect of water fluoridation on adverse birth outcomes Project Summary/Abstract The objective of this K99/R00 proposal is to estimate the effect of community water fluoridation on adverse birth outcomes in California and identify whether there are subpopulations who are especially vulnerable to fluoride exposure during pregnancy. Fluoride has been added to water supplies to promote dental health in the United States since 1945, but the impacts on pregnancy outcomes have never been assessed. It is possible that maternal and in-utero fetal exposure to fluoride increases risk of preterm birth and small-for- gestational age. A small number of studies in other countries suggest there is an increased risk of adverse birth outcomes associated with drinking water with naturally high levels of fluoride, and evidence suggests fluoride consumption can affect thyroid function and cardiovascular systems, both of which play important roles in regulating and maintaining a healthy pregnancy. Since 1995, California has required water systems with at least 10,000 service connections to fluoridate their water, but systems were only required to implement a fluoridation program once the funds were allocated. Therefore, there is a substantial amount of variability in which water systems have added fluoride over the last 25 years, and when they did so. We will leverage this variation in water fluoridation practices in California to (1) identify the effects of changes in water fluoridation on adverse birth outcomes during 2006-2017 and (2) evaluate whether there are heterogeneous exposure effects by maternal/fetal characteristics and environmental co-exposures. Furthermore, we will use the ECHO.CA.IL pregnancy cohort, which is composed of pregnant women and their children in San Francisco and Illinois, to (3a) assess whether maternal urinary fluoride during the second trimester is associated with reduced gestational age or lower birthweight-for-gestational-age-z-scores at birth and (3b) evaluate whether there are heterogeneous effects of exposure by maternal/fetal characteristics and environmental co-exposures. The research plan is bolstered by an exceptional mentorship team and training plan at the University of San Francisco, California. The proposed project builds on the applicant’s background in perinatal epidemiology and provides training in new statistical methods to identify heterogeneous exposure effects and education in the biological processes of gestation and parturition, exposure assessment of environmental chemicals, and translating scientific findings to policymakers. The combined research and training plans will enable the candidate to transition into an independent researcher of policy-relevant social and environmental factors that shape perinatal health. This research aligns with NIEHS’s strategic goals to evaluate health effects of the exposome, identify individual susceptibilities to environmental hazards, utilize data science techniques, and generate evidence that can be utilized by policymakers to improve population health. Project Narrative Community water fluoridation may affect perinatal health outcomes, but this has never been evaluated in the United States. It is critical to understand how this widespread practice affects the health of mothers and infants, and whether subgroups of the population are uniquely vulnerable. This project will provide critical information to assist public health officials in making informed decisions about the ongoing practice of adding fluoride to water supplies in the United States.",Evaluating the effect of water fluoridation on adverse birth outcomes,10284698,K99ES033274,"['Affect ', ' Arsenic ', ' Award ', ' Birth Records ', ' Birth Weight ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition

"Longer term effects of a natural disaster on health and socio-economic status Abstract Exposures to extreme events are increasingly common in many parts of the globe as a function of changes in weather patterns combined with rising sea levels, but there is a paucity of data to support scientific research on the implications of such exposures for population health and well-being over the long-term. STAR, the Study of the Tsunami Aftermath and Recovery, is a unique exception. We have interviewed respondents from 10 months before the December 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami for 10 years. This project will follow up the same respondents 15 years after the tsunami. The pre-tsunami baseline is a population-representative survey of 27,000 individuals who were living along the coast of Aceh and North Sumatra, Indonesia. The tsunami constitutes a large-scale, unanticipated natural disaster in an area that was not thought to be prone to tsunamis. Moreover, its impacts were spatially idiosyncratic across the study area. Whether a particular community was inundated by the waves depended on a combination of the wave direction, seabed and shoreline topography. Of 368 baseline communities, about a fifth were devastated, a third were somewhat damaged and the rest were not directly affected. These features of the natural experiment provide the basis for identifying causal impacts of this major natural disaster which killed 170,000 people in the study area. The baseline and six post-tsunami waves collected during the prior phase of this project provide detailed information about exposure to and experience of the disaster and the evolution of health and wellbeing, broadly defined, for baseline respondents who survived the tsunami plus new household members. In each follow-up, we have interviewed 95% of all baseline survivors. In this continuation we will re-interview all baseline survivors and their household members fifteen years after the tsunami. We will place these data in the public domain, adding to prior waves of STAR already in the public domain to create an unparalleled data resource for the scientific community. Focusing on those who were exposed to the tsunami as children (age <12y and in utero at the time), we will investigate the impacts of tsunami exposure on the evolution of health, education and cognitive performance, linking outcomes to changes in material and psycho-social resources at the family level as well as community level resources. The latter will be measured combining administrative data and information extracted from satellite imagery using machine learning. Longer-term impacts, fifteen years after the tsunami, will exploit innovative human capital measures including biomarkers, executive function and emotional reactivity. Loss of one or both parents is among the most extreme exposures. We will explore the causal effects of orphanhood by comparing children who lost parents in the tsunami with those in the same community who did not. Project Narrative This project will field the fifteen year follow up of the Study of the Tsunami Aftermath and Recovery (STAR), a large-scale longitudinal study of individuals differentially exposed to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. The data provide unique information on the evolution of population health of a group of 27,000 individuals first interviewed before the tsunami, including biomarker measurements and integrated information on environmental change.",Longer term effects of a natural disaster on health and socio-economic status,10250551,R01HD052762,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Attention ', ' Censuses ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Child Welfare ', ' adolescent welfare ', ' child well being ', ' child wellbeing ', ' Cicatrix ', ' Scars ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Community Surveys ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disasters ', ' Earthquakes ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Evolution ', ' Family ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Health ', ' Health education ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Household ', ' Indonesia ', ' East Indies ', ' Malay Archipelago ', ' Netherlands East Indies ', ' Interview ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Natural Disasters ', ' Parents ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Privatization ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Science ', ' Shock ', ' Circulatory Collapse ', ' circulatory shock ', ' Siblings ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Measures ', ' acetone hydrazone ', ' AceH ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Public Domains ', ' Imagery ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Sumatra ', ' Survivors ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Respondent ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Indian Ocean ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' Height ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' psychosocial ', ' Infusion ', ' Infusion procedures ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' member ', ' Categories ', ' Emotional ', ' Documentation ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' in utero ', ' environmental change ', ' human capital ', ' reconstruction ', ' health economics ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Natural experiment ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Tsunami ', ' weather patterns ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' emerging adult ', ' early adulthood ', ' population health ', ' cognitive performance ', ' sea level rise ', ' behavioral response ', ' behavior response ', ' Scientific Inquiry ', ' data resource ', ' Child Health ', ' adverse childhood events ', ' adverse childhood experiences ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,498320,NC-04
"Prenatal Environmental Mixtures, Cognitive Control and Reward Processes, And Risk for Psychiatric Problems in Adolescence. In utero exposure to environmental chemicals can disturb neurobehavioral development in both animals and in humans. The pathways linking in utero environmental exposures to neurobehavioral development likely involve exposure-induced changes in the function of neural circuits that support cognitive control and reward processes. We hypothesize that changes in the function of these circuits may act as a pathway between environmental exposure and a range of maladaptive behaviors that commonly emerge in late childhood and adolescence, a period that has been largely understudied with respect to the effects of prenatal exposures on neurodevelopmental outcomes. Such behavioral symptoms include attention problems, substance abuse, and psychotic experiences. This study will: 1) apply novel pattern recognition approaches to identify specific exposure profiles of complex high-dimensional mixtures of prenatal chemical and social exposures and examine how these profiles explain variation in risk for these behavioral symptoms in adolescence; 2) use task and resting state functional MRI (fMRI) to identify how distinct exposure profiles affect circuits that support cognitive control and reinforcement learning; and 3) explore if exposure-induced changes in brain activation and connectivity mediate associations between prenatal exposure profiles and behavioral symptoms in adolescence. Impact: This R01 will integrate advanced pattern recognition methods, a cognitive neuroscience approach and state-of-the-art fMRI techniques to explore brain pathways through which prenatal exposures alter behavior later in adolescence. We will explore circuit-based changes in brain function that may mediate associations between prenatal exposure profiles and symptoms of psychiatric disorders that typically emerge and co-occur in adolescence. By simultaneously studying mixtures of chemical and social stressors as well as profiles of co- occurring symptoms, we will greatly enhance our ability to comprehensively characterize the complex impacts of prenatal environmental exposures on behavioral symptoms in adolescence. Our findings will allow public health interventions to improve the quality of children's perinatal environment and the development of novel circuit-specific intervention tools. Pregnant women and their fetuses are exposed to multiple environmental insults during gestation, a very influential period for the fetal developing brain; prenatal exposures have been linked to increased cognitive, behavioral, and emotional problems including self-regulation, attention, conduct, and substance use problems, and psychotic experiences. Using a cognitive neuroscience approach, we seek to understand how in utero exposure to complex environmental mixtures alters the function of brain circuits that support cognitive control and reward processing, and gives rise to a range of behaviors that commonly emerge in late childhood and adolescence, a period that has been largely understudied with respect to the effects of prenatal exposures on neurodevelopmental outcomes. Our findings will allow public health interventions to improve the quality of children's perinatal environment and the development of novel circuit-specific intervention tools.","Prenatal Environmental Mixtures, Cognitive Control and Reward Processes, And Risk for Psychiatric Problems in Adolescence.",10303872,R01ES032296,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Affect ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Animals ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Behavioral Symptoms ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Fetus ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Newborns ', ' newborn child ', ' newborn children ', ' Influentials ', ' Joints ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Mothers ', ' Neural Pathways ', ' Neurotoxins ', ' neurotoxicant ', ' Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons ', ' polyaromatic hydrocarbons ', ' polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' expectant mother ', ' expecting mother ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Mediating ', ' phthalates ', ' Inferior frontal gyrus ', ' Inferior Frontal Convolution ', ' base ', ' Perinatal ', ' Peripartum ', ' improved ', ' Dorsal ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Chemicals ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' fetal ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' trait ', ' Chemical Exposure ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' neural function ', ' Neurophysiology -

"Built Environment Assessment through Computer visiON (BEACON): Applying Deep Learning to Street-Level and Satellite Images to Estimate Built Environment Effects on Cardiovascular Health PROJECT SUMMARY Over 80% of the US population resides in urban areas, and the built environment—the buildings, streets, and green spaces in which we live—may drive cardiovascular disease (CVD) by promoting or limiting physical activity and weight gain, and by influencing exposures to environmental factors, such as air pollution, extreme temperatures, and noise. Evidence for the built environment and CVD has been dominated by cross-sectional studies with nonspecific exposure assessment. Developing precise, time-varying, and personalized exposure metrics is necessary to establish causal relationships between the built environment and CVD, which are crucial to informing policy-relevant, actionable interventions. It is now possible to estimate such exposure metrics at scale in prospective cohort studies using deep learning computer vision methods, a class of machine learning algorithms that can accurately process images, combined with time-varying nationwide street-level imagery, high resolution satellite data, and novel mobile health technologies. We propose to identify the influence of the built environment on CVD health behaviors and CVD incidence by developing built environment exposure measures from deep learning algorithms, and to apply these exposure measures to time-activity data in participants with global positioning systems (GPS) data from the Nurses’ Health Study 3 (N=500), and to geocoded residential addresses from nationwide Nurses’ Health Study, Nurses’ Health Study II, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study prospective cohorts (N=288,000). We will create built environment exposure measures by leveraging deep learning algorithms applied to nationwide Google Street View imagery (2007-2020) and high-resolution Landsat satellite data (1986-2020) to create fine-scale, time-varying built environment metrics of the natural environment (e.g., trees), physical environment (e.g., sidewalks), perceptions (e.g., safety), and urban form (e.g., compact high-rise). We will use a mix of innovative analytical approaches to determine the effect of the built environment on CVD-related health behaviors and CVD incidence across different time horizons. First, we will append these metrics to time-activity patterns of participants who have collected minute-level data on GPS and physical activity from smartphones and consumer wearable devices to quantify how minute-level exposure to the built environment is related to CVD health behaviors. Next, we will apply novel built environment metrics to residential address histories of participants to estimate how self-reported CVD health behaviors change after their residential built environment changes. Last, we will examine the association between long-term cumulative residential exposure to the built environment and CVD incidence over 34 years of follow-up. Our work will enable us to measure built environment exposure from unprecedented perspectives in large prospective cohorts, to elucidate potential causal relationships between the built environment and CVD health behaviors, and to better specify pathways to CVD incidence. Ultimately, our work will yield actionable insights to guide land use policy and urban planning strategies to design cities that optimize cardiovascular health. PROJECT NARRATIVE The built environment—the buildings, streets, and green spaces in which we live—may influence cardiovascular disease (CVD) by promoting or limiting physical activity and weight gain and by shaping exposures to environmental hazards (e.g., air pollution, extreme temperatures, noise); however, developing accurate, time- varying, and personalized exposure metrics is necessary to build causal relationships between the built environment and CVD and to inform policy-relevant, actionable interventions. We propose to identify the influence of the built environment on CVD-related health behaviors and CVD incidence by developing longitudinal built environment exposure measures from street-view and satellite imagery using deep learning algorithms, and to apply these exposure measures to time-activity data from a) 500 participants with global positioning systems (GPS) data from the Nurses’ Health Study 3 (NHS3) and b) over 34 years of geocoded residential addresses from three large nationwide cohorts of over 288,000 US adult women and men from the Nurses’ Health Study, Nurses’ Health Study II, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study prospective cohorts. Our work will enable us to measure time-varying exposure to the built environment with unprecedented precision in large prospective cohorts, to elucidate potential relationships between the built environment and CVD health behaviors, to better specify pathways to CVD incidence, and ultimately, to yield actionable insights to guide land use policy and urban planning strategies to design cities that optimize cardiovascular health.",Built Environment Assessment through Computer visiON (BEACON): Applying Deep Learning to Street-Level and Satellite Images to Estimate Built Environment Effects on Cardiovascular Health,10192819,R01HL150119,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cities ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Environment ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Incidence ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary infarction ', ' heart attack ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart infarction ', ' Noise ', ' Perception ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Safety ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Time ', ' Trees ', ' Weight Gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' wt gain ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Environmental Hazards ', ' Measures ', ' urban planning ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' urban area ', ' urban location ', ' urban region ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Physical activity ', ' insight ', ' Policies ', ' Planet Earth ', ' Earth ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' catalog ', ' Catalogs ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Physical environment ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' land use ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' extreme temperature ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Ancillary Study ', "" Nurses' Health Study "", ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Health Professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Health behavior change ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' built environment ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' Green space ', ' greenspace ', ' petabyte ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' Prospective cohort study ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' deep learning ', ' Global Positioning System ', ' Infrastructure ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' ']",NHLBI,"HARVARD PILGRIM HEALTH CARE, INC.",R01,2021,785476,MA-07
"CHABMAP (Cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Bloom Mapping and Analyses Platform) technology automates the quantification of toxic CyanoHABs exposure epochs for any waterbody.

"Extracellular Vesicles as a Link Between Placental and Renal Dysfunction in Preeclampsia PROJECT SUMMARY Preeclampsia (PE) is a devastating hypertensive disorder of pregnancy that is a leading cause of maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity worldwide. It affects 2-10% of women and accounts for 16% of maternal deaths related to childbirth in developed countries. PE is difficult to study because it is a multifactorial disorder with varying molecular mechanisms associated with the development of the spectrum of clinical symptoms associated with early onset, late onset, and severe PE. A personalized medicine approach applied to dissecting the underlying mechanisms of PE may be beneficial to reduce clinical incidence of this devastating syndrome. The placenta plays a key role in the development of PE, leading to widespread maternal endothelial dysfunction, hypertension, and systemic multi-organ failure in PE. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing protein, RNA, and lipid cargo are continuously extruded from the placenta, and are capable of interacting with maternal organs including the kidney. PE is primarily associated with placental and renal dysfunction, and PE is the most common cause of acute kidney injury during pregnancy. However, no studies have investigated the potential of placenta-derived RNA cargo as a link between placental and renal dysfunction in PE. Urinary EVs are derived from multiple tissue types and represent a trove of biomarkers that are increasingly being utilized to diagnose renal disorders. Further, urine samples can be obtained throughout pregnancy non-invasively and could potentially be utilized to identify biomarkers related to placental dysfunction in PE. In the proposed research, during the mentored phase, cutting-edge RNA-Seq technology coupled with computational biological and machine learning approaches will be applied to profile the transcriptome of urinary EVs in women with PE compared to normal pregnancy. Preliminary data indicates that it is possible to isolate and profile the transcriptome of urinary EVs from maternal urine throughout normal gestation, and that placenta-derived and placenta-specific mRNA and miRNA can be detected within the urinary EV population. This presents a novel technique that has potential to identify biomarkers as well as provide information on placental dysfunction in PE in a non-invasive manner. During the independent phase, the candidate will utilize an in vitro approach to investigate the effect of uptake of placenta-derived EVs with miRNA cargo associated with PE on the function of proximal tubule epithelial cells and cortical collecting duct cells. These two renal-specific cell types are involved in tubular reabsorption in the nephron, a process that is compromised leading to increased excretion of protein in the urine in some preeclamptic pregnancies. This proposal is multidisciplinary, utilizing basic biology, clinical research, and high-performance computing applied to investigating placental dysfunction in PE. These experiments are significant because they will generate novel information on the role of placenta- derived EVs in renal dysfunction in PE, as well as point the way towards preventative and therapeutic targets that may be transformative and clinically relevant. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will examine the transcriptome of urinary extracellular vesicles obtained non-invasively as a source of placenta-derived nucleic acids reflective of the development of preeclampsia (PE), and will con- duct in vitro experiments to determine the role of placental extracellular vesicles in renal dysfunction in PE.",Extracellular Vesicles as a Link Between Placental and Renal Dysfunction in Preeclampsia,10468485,R00HD096125,"['Affect ', ' Biology ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Circulation ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Gestational Age ', ' Chronologic Fetal Maturity ', ' Fetal Age ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Libraries ', ' Lipids ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Maternal Mortality ', ' maternal death ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology Parent award: OVERALL : ABSTRACT This is the third competing continuation for an accomplished Environmental Health Sciences Core Center (EHS CC), The Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology (CEET) at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn). The Director is Trevor M. Penning, PhD (The Thelma Brown and Henry Charles Molinoff Professor of Pharmacology) and the Deputy Director is Rebecca A. Simmons, MD (The Hallam Hurt Endowed Professor in Pediatrics). The Center is comprised of 71 members from 18 Departments and 5 Schools, with almost equal representation of basic and clinician-scientists drawn from the Perelman School of Medicine (PSOM) and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). The CEET has built an institutional, regional and national identity in environmental health sciences (EHS) in the absence of a School of Public Health and Department of EHS at Penn. The synergistic combination of basic and clinician-scientists within the CEET promotes translational environmental health research that addresses fundamental questions and translates knowledge into action to have a major impact on human health and disease consistent with the NIEHS Strategic Plan. The CEET mission is to “elucidate the mechanistic links between environmental exposures and human disease, and translate findings into action to improve the health of vulnerable individuals, and local, national, and global communities”. This mission is accomplished through five aims. In Aim 1: We use a flexible thematic area structure to conduct translational environmental health research to improve precision public health. Our current themes are in Air Pollution & Lung Health; Environmental Exposures & Cancer; Windows-of- Susceptibility; and Environmental Neuroscience. Each thematic area integrates the pillars or exposure science, adverse outcome constructs (pathways and networks) to explain the phenome with translation to communities and human subjects. In Aim 2: We conduct bi-directional communication with communities in S.E and N.E. Pennsylvania and use community engagement to set the research agenda for the CEET. In Aim 3: We provide a facility core structure to promote precision public health. Our Integrative Health Sciences Facility Core is adept in human subject study design and in conducting population exposure services, using cartographic modeling, GIS tools and biosensors. Biomarkers of exposure and effect are measured in our Translational Biomarker Core which conducts mass spectrometric assays at a level of precision and accuracy difficult to emulate elsewhere. The Exposure Biology Informatics Core brings to bear the power of computation, machine learning and AI to predict the toxicity of unknowns and integrate Big-data sets to recognize patterns in “omics” data and predict adverse outcomes. In Aim 4: We build capacity in environmental health sciences by funding pilot projects to Early Stage Investigators (ESI) and to senior investigators conducting environmental health research for the first time. In Aim 5: We cultivate the careers of ESI through a transformative Environmental Health Scientist Support Program that provides mentoring, grant proposal review, environmental health and Facility Core workshops.

"The Study of the Environment and Alzheimer's disease and related Dementias (SEAD) PROJECT SUMMARY The rising prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is a major public health and clinical challenge in the United States. Identification of ADRD causes to inform prevention and policy is the most efficient way to address these challenges. Most research to date has focused on identifying genetic causes of ADRD, however, recent population-scale studies have shown that environmental exposures, such as lead and cadmium, also contribute to ADRD risk and etiology. Initial findings on environmental factors linked to ADRD risk is promising, but human evidence is limited. A wide range of environmental exposures (exposome) have never been evaluated systematically in relation to incident ADRD. While there is a growing demand to predict future risk for ADRS more precisely, the role of exposomic data in improving ADRD risk prediction has never been evaluated. To address these gaps, we propose a prospective cohort study by capitalizing on existing large-scale, United States nationally representative, multi-ethnic population-based data. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, from 1998-2010, n>15,000) has a variety of environmental chemical exposure measurements, behavioral risk factors, and clinical phenotypes, and when linked to Medicare data, provides up to 25 years of incident ADRD. We aim to (1) conduct a biologic hypothesis-based approach to test the associations of chronic exposure to lead and cadmium with incident ADRD; (2) conduct a data-driven environment-wide association study to systematically evaluate a wide-range of environmental toxicants with incident ADRD; and (3) develop and validate an exposome-based risk prediction model for ADRD using machine learning methods. The proposed study will advance scientific understanding on how modifiable and currently ubiquitous environmental neurotoxicants can lead to the development of ADRD. This study assesses the exposome to improve prediction of future disease risk and define vulnerable populations more precisely. This research will highlight individual-level and population-level interventions (i.e. precision health) to effectively prevent or reduce the risk of ADRD in the US population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed study is relevant to public health and precision health because comprehensive evaluation of a wide range of modifiable environmental exposures, including the currently ubiquitous environmental neurotoxicants lead and cadmium, will advance scientific understanding on the etiology of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) and inform individual-level and population-level interventions to effectively prevent or reduce the burden of ADRD. The proposed study is directly responsive to the 2018 National Institute on Aging AD Research Summit recommendations related to Understanding the Impact of the Environment to Advance Disease Prevention and Enabling Precision Medicine Research for AD/ADRD, and to the research goal of NOT-AG-18-053, Enabling precision medicine for AD/ADRD through deep molecular phenotyping.",The Study of

My long-term career goal is to conduct a program of research that translates neurobiological models of anxiety and its treatment into guidance for real- life clinical decision-making. Currently, although exposure therapy is the best available treatment for anxiety disorders, 25% of patients do not respond to an adequate course of exposure therapy and we do not know why. A critical long-term goal is to improve exposure therapy response by tailoring therapy based on the neurobiological profile of each patient. Because the mechanism of exposure therapy is thought to be extinction learning, the proposed research aims to address this goal by directly linking exposure therapy response to extinction learning in a sample of adults with social anxiety disorder. Specifically, I aim to identify neurobiological features of extinction learning that predict successful recall, are associated with clinical symptoms, and predict therapy response. The project will use a paradigm that I developed and piloted to assess physiological and neuroimaging measures of extinction learning. The expected outcomes are an innovative mechanistic neurobiological model that can identify patients at risk of non-response, as well as specific, testable hypotheses for how to improve outcomes for these patients. In order for this project, and my broader career goals, to succeed, it is imperative that I have expertise related to exposure therapy, predictive modeling, analysis of self-report, physiological, and fMRI data, and traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. I already have expertise in the theory and implementation of exposure therapy, as well as the analysis of self-report and fMRI data. This K23 award would allow me to receive advanced training in (1) machine learning techniques for building and evaluating clinically relevant predictive models, (2) specific skills for analysis and interpretation of physiological data, and (3) traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trials. I have assembled an inter-disciplinary team of mentors at Stanford University that are ideally suited to guide my research and training. Dr. Leanne Williams (primary mentor, Department of Psychiatry) will provide expertise on using neurobiology to make treatment outcome predictions, and provide overall career development mentorship throughout the project. Dr. James Gross (co-mentor, Department of Psychology) will provide expertise on physiological data and its integration with self-report and fMRI data. Dr. Tze Lai (co-mentor, Department of Statistics) will provide expertise on predictive models and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. The training and associated research will take place in the Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Department at Stanford University, a world renowned hub of neuroscience and psychiatry research, and at Stanford's Center for Cognitive and Neurobiological Imaging, a state-of-the-art neuroimaging facility. Project Narrative Social anxiety disorder affects as many as 12% of Americans, resulting in significant distress and disability. Although exposure therapy is one of the best treatments available, as many as 25% of patients do not respond and we do not know why. Extinction learning is thought to be the mechanism of exposure therapy, and the neuroscience of extinction learning has advanced significantly since exposure therapy was developed; however, there has been little application towards improved clinical outcomes. This project aims to improve exposure therapy response for patients with social anxiety disorder by directly linking exposure therapy response to the neurobiology of extinction learning.",Developing a mechanistic neurobiological model of exposure therapy response based on fear extinction theory,10120729,K23MH113708,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Animals ', ' Anxiety ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Extinction (Psychology) ', ' Extinction ', ' behavioral extinction ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Future ', ' Galvanic Skin Response ', ' Electrodermal Response ', ' Psychogalvanic Reflex ', ' Skin Electric Conductance ', ' skin conductance ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychology ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' statistics ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Mediating ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Loudness ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Anterior ', ' Dorsal ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Distress ', ' learning extinction ', ' Funding ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' American ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' skills ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' K23 Award ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Program ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict treatment response ', ' therapy prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' Research Training ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Cognitive ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' individualized medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapeutic strategy ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' predictive marker ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' anxious symptom ', ' social anxiety ', ' Social Anxiety Disorder ', ' treatment of anxiety disorders ', ' anxious individuals ', ' anxious ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' improved outcome ', ' recruit ', ' patient response ', ' patient specific response ', ' responsive patient ', ' clinical outcome measures ', ' ']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,186408,CA-18
"An Agent-Based Modeling Platform for Environmental Biotechnology Hazardous pollutants in the environment continue to threaten public health and environmental  safety. Human exposure to major contaminant classes, such as polyfluorinated compounds  (PFCs), hazardous organic compounds (HOCs), and heavy metals, has been linked to a variety of  diseases and is subject to stringent State and Federal environmental regulations.  Bioremediation is a low-cost and environmentally friendly approach with many successful  use-cases; however, conventional bioremediation technologies can suffer from unreliability, low  degradation rates, and incomplete degradation. As stakeholders to Superfund sites and other sites  with water or soil pollution urgently demand more efficient, less costly and more reliable  remediation technologies, it is critical to look to advancements in computational  modeling to develop next-generation, precision-engineered bioremediation technologies. The proposed project builds on successful outcomes from Phase I in which a new computational  platform was designed and validated to accurately predict the bioremediation kinetics of  a multi-organism microcosm degrading a combination of HOCs in groundwater. The basis of  this platform is an approach called agent-based modeling (ABM), where the functions of  individual components (e.g. microorganisms) within complex ecosystems are used to predict and  optimize system-level properties (e.g. bioremediation kinetics). In this Phase II project, the novel computational platform developed in Phase I is  further improved with a machine learning component that leverages bioinformatics  databases to develop rationally tailored microbiomes for degrading complex pollutant  mixtures. Iterative experimental validation of model outputs is conducted using an innovative  materials science platform that maintains the relative concentration of different species in the  microbiome constant within the multi-zone treatment barrier (in-situ) or multi-zone bioreactor  (ex-situ). The project includes focused development of a prototype for one bioremediation use-case,  which is directly compared to a conventional (non-precision) bioremediation system treating   actual contaminated groundwater. This will be performed in order to assess and quantify  the expected technical and economic benefits of harnessing the project's novel computational  platform in biotechnology development. The broad, long-term impact of the proposed project will be to transform the development and  implementation of bioremediation by integrating advancements in computational modeling, machine  learning, bioinformatics, and materials science. By leveraging novel tools across disciplines, the  project will accelerate the development of more precise, reliable and inexpensive technologies for  environmental remediation. The successful outcome of the proposed project will also provide new  collaborative opportunities for industry and academia to more rapidly address the remediation of  high-priority pollutants in the environment, and ultimately help mitigate the effects of hazardous  pollutants on communities impacted by the presence of environmental contamination. PROJECT NARRATIVE Contaminated soils and waters continue to threaten public health and safety. This project builds on the development of a novel computational platform for predicting the complex, dynamic interactions between microbial ecosystems and hazardous contaminants-of-concern in the environment, and to utilize this information to develop improved engineered remediation biotechnologies.",An Agent-Based Modeling Platform for Environmental Biotechnology,10158243,R44ES026541,"['Biodegradation ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Colorado ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Monitoring ', ' Ecologic Monitoring ', ' Ecological Monitoring ', ' environmental testing ', ' Environmental Pollution ', ' environmental contaminant ', ' environmental contamination ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Indiana ', ' Industry ', ' Kinetics ', ' Laboratories ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Polymers ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Safety ', ' Soil ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Water Pollution ', ' economic evaluation ', ' economic analysis ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Letters ', ' Gingkgo ', ' Gingko ', ' Ginkgo ', ' Maidenhair Tree ', ' Ginkgo biloba ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Heavy Metals ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Bioreactors ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Side ', ' In Situ ', ' microorganism ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' soil pollution ', ' groundwater ', ' ground water ', ' success ', ' Bioremediations ', ' enzyme pathway ', ' pollutant ', ' microbial ', ' Municipalities ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' superfund site ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Address ', ' Academia ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Output ', ' microbiome ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' remediation ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' exposed human population ', ' human exposure ', ' prototype ', ' Learning Module ', ' Education Module ', ' Educational Module ', ' Teaching Module ', ' materials science ', ' laboratory experiment ', ' lab assignment ', ' lab experiment ', ' laboratory activity ', ' laboratory assignment ', ' laboratory exercise ', ' computational platform ', ' computing platform ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NIEHS,"MICROVI BIOTECH, INC.",R44,2021,630992,CA-15
"Prenatal and Postnatal Exposure to Environmental Mixtures: Neurodevelopment and DNA Methylation Biomarkers PROJECT SUMMARY Prenatal and postnatal childhood exposure to metals, essential and non-essential, is ubiquitous via dietary and environmental sources. Heavy metals, including lead and methylmercury, are well characterized as potent neurotoxicants, associated with lower cognition and poor learning abilities. Yet, our understanding of the neurotoxicity and joint impact of many other common prenatal and postnatal metal exposures remains extremely limited. Even less is known about the combined impact of exposure to multiple metals during fetal development or postnatal exposure during early childhood, or the influence of other environmental mixtures such as nutrients, which may have shared sources, on the neurodevelopmental effects of metals. To address this significant gap, our long-term goal is to quantify the neurocognitive impact of ubiquitous prenatal and postnatal environmental mixtures and identify cord blood DNA methylation biomarkers that can reconstruct prenatal environmental exposures and predict future neurocognitive development in children. We will test if objective measures of key prenatal maternal nutrients, such as folate, vitamin B12 and essential metals attenuate or mitigate the neurotoxicity of metal mixtures. To accomplish this goal, we will leverage resources from an established U.S. pre-birth cohort, Project Viva. In this cohort, we have measured concentrations for 14 prenatal maternal metals in the first trimester of pregnancy and blood samples collected in early-childhood (~3 years) ready for metal testing as well as ready to use genome-wide cord blood DNA methylation screens. Children have been followed prospectively and undergone detail testing for neurodevelopment in early (~3 years of age) and mid-childhood (~7 years). We hypothesize that prenatal maternal 1st trimester and postnatal early childhood neurotoxic metal mixtures are associated with poor neurodevelopment in early and mid-childhood (Aim 1), and that prenatal first trimester maternal plasma folate, vitamin B12 and blood concentration of essential metals protect against prenatal metal mixture neurotoxicity (Aim 2). We also hypothesize that DNA methylation marks measured in umbilical cord blood at birth can reconstruct prenatal exposure to metals (Aim 3.a) and that cord blood DNAm marks predict future neurocognitive development in early and mid-childhood (Aim 3.b). By testing longitudinal associations in a large cohort of children with detail cognitive assessments as well as objective biomarkers of metals and nutrients, we will overcome limitations currently faced by existing studies testing few exposures simultaneously. We will use novel statistical methodology to model prenatal and postnatal environmental mixtures and machine learning algorithms to build epigenetic predictors of exposure and neurodevelopment. This research will provide a comprehensive quantification of the cognitive burden of prenatal and postnatal mixtures, the development of biomarkers of exposure and neurodevelopment and the identification of potential prenatal nutritional intervention strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood decrements in neurocognitive development result in large population burden and expenditure. The proposed research will identify the extent to which prenatal and postnatal neurotoxic mixtures as well as key prenatal nutrients jointly influence neurocognitive development in childhood. This research will provide early life biomarkers that reconstruct prenatal exposures and predict childhood neurocognitive performance with the goal of developing novel and early-life interventions to protect children.",Prenatal and Postnatal Exposure to Environmental Mixtures: Neurodevelopment and DNA Methylation Biomarkers,10186748,R01ES031259,"['Affect ', ' Award ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood - brain barrier anatomy ', ' Blood-Brain Barrier ', ' Hemato-Encephalic Barrier ', ' bloodbrain barrier ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Cognition ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Expenditure ', ' Fetal Development ', ' Developing fetus ', ' Folic Acid ', ' Folate ', ' Pteroylglutamic Acid ', ' Vitamin M ', ' vitamin Bc ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Newborns ', ' newborn child ', ' newborn children ', ' Joints ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mercury ', ' Hg element ', ' Metals ', ' Methodology ', ' Methylmercury Compounds ', ' Methyl Mercury Compounds ', ' methylmercury ', ' Neurotoxins ', ' neurotoxicant ', ' Placenta ', ' Cells Placenta-Tissue ', ' Normal Placentoma ', ' Placenta Embryonic Tissue ', ' Placentome ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' First Pregnancy Trimester ', ' 1st trimester ', ' Early Placental Phase ', ' First Trimester ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Testing ', ' Vitamin B 12 ', ' Cyanocobalamin ', ' VIT B12 ', ' Vitamin B12 ', ' Measures ', ' Umbilical Cord Blood ', ' Cord Blood ', ' fetal cord blood ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Chemicals ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' diet intervention ', ' Exposure to ', ' Attenuated ', ' Heavy Metals ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' postnatal ', ' Source ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Performance ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' toxicant ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Nutrient ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' novel ', ' offspring ', ' Learning disability ', ' Learning Disabilities ', ' Modeling ', ' exposed in utero ', ' fetal exposure ', ' in utero exposure ', ' intra-uterine environmental exposure ', ' intrauterine environmental exposure ', ' prenatally exposed ', ' prenatal exposure ', ' neurocognitive test ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Consequentialism ', ' Address ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' in utero ', ' cost ', ' prenatal environmental exposure ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Child Neurotoxicity ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Metal exposure ', ' exposure to metal ', ' 3 year old ', ' 3 years of age ', ' age 3 years ', ' three year old ', ' three years of age ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' neurotoxic ', ' neurotoxicity ', ' neuron toxicity ', ' neuronal toxicity ', ' exposed human population ', ' human exposure ', ' novel marker ', ' new marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' learning ability ', ' learning achievement ', ' learning competence ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' methylation biomarker ', ' methylation marker ', ' cognitive ability ', ' cognitive load ', ' cognitive burden ', ' Data Science ', ' biomarker development ', ' routine screening ', ' annual screening ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' neurodevelopmental effect ', ' neurodevelopment effect ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' dietary ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2021,425421,CA-13
"Enhancing the Utility of the Trend-in-Trend Research Design Patients, clinicians, and policymakers often need valid information about the real-world effects of drugs and other exposures for which there have been pronounced time-trends in use. For example, the rapid growth in the use of rofecoxib in the early 2000s and of exogenous testosterone from 2000–2013 was accompanied by an urgent need for knowledge about the cardiovascular effects of those drugs. Randomized trials seldom enroll a sufficient number of subjects, or follow them long enough, to examine associations with rare outcomes. Therefore, non-randomized studies are needed, even though they are susceptible to unmeasured confounding and other forms of bias. To address these limitations of available epidemiologic designs, we recently introduced the trend-in-trend design: a novel, hybrid epidemiologic-ecologic research design that is applicable when there is a prominent trend in the use of the study exposure. Substantial additional development is needed to realize the full public health impact of the trend-in-trend research design. Areas in most need of development include: evaluation of a sequential analysis extension for real-time post-marketing safety surveillance; evaluation of machine learning to specify the trend-in-trend design’s underlying cumulative probability of exposure model; evaluation of dose-response relationships; and evaluation of treatment effect heterogeneity based on baseline patient characteristics. For each of these methodologic needs, we propose an approach for which we will: 1) assess its statistical properties, in particular large-sample validity through asymptotics and finite sample statistical power; 2) evaluate its performance in thorough simulation studies; and 3) proof-test the approach using the known association between rofecoxib-acute myocardial infarction in healthcare data. Finally, we will apply these developments to the unresolved and highly important question of the cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and thromboembolic effects of exogenous testosterone in men. This study will have broad scientific, clinical, and public health impact by greatly extending the utility of a novel epidemiologic research design with demonstrated validity and is applicable to a broad range of exposures with a prominent trend in use. It will also evaluate the safety of exogenous testosterone, a question of tremendous clinical and public health importance. Examining the safety of prescription drugs is one enormously important application of this design that has the potential to benefit many millions of people. As the trend-in-trend design is also applicable to non-drug exposures that have a pronounced time-trend (e.g., medical procedures, lifestyle factors, environmental exposures, etc.), its potential impact on the population is even broader. This project will enhance the utility of the trend-in-trend research design, a novel hybrid epidemiologic-ecologic design that is applicable to a broad range of exposures with a prominent trend in use. Further, we will leverage these methods developments to study the cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and thromboembolic safety of exogenous testosterone, unanswered questions of tremendous clinical and public health importance for older adult males.",Enhancing the Utility of the Trend-in-Trend Research Design,10162467,R01AG064589,"['Adoption ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', ' NSAIDs ', ' Non Steroidal Antiinflammatory Agents ', ' Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', ' Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Agents ', ' Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Drug ', ' non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ', ' non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs ', ' nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Heart Arrest ', ' Asystole ', ' Cardiac Arrest ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hybrids ', ' Hypoglycemia ', ' hypoglycemic ', ' hypoglycemic episodes ', ' male ', ' Marketing ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Odds Ratio ', ' Cross-Product Ratio ', ' Relative Odds ', ' Risk Ratio ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' medication prescription ', ' prescribed medication ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Pulmonary Embolism ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Safety ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Epidemiologic Research Design ', ' Epidemiological Research Design ', ' Testing ', ' Testosterone ', ' Therapeutic Testosterone ', ' Trans-Testosterone ', ' Time ', ' Ventricular Arrhythmia ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Deep Vein Thrombosis ', ' Deep-Venous Thrombosis ', ' Acute myocardial infarction ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' COX-2 protein ', ' COX2 enzyme ', ' Cyclo-Oxygenase-2 ', ' PGH Synthase 2 ', ' PGHS2 ', ' PHS II ', ' Prostaglandin G/H Synthase 2 ', ' Prostaglandin H2 Synthase 2 ', ' Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase 2 ', ' cyclo-oxygenase II ', ' prostaglandin H synthase-2 ', ' cyclooxygenase 2 ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Speed ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Vioxx ', ' Rofecoxib ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Calendar ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' lifestyle factors ', ' life-style factor ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' trend ', ' To specify ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cerebrovascular ', ' cerebral vascular ', ' cerebro-vascular ', ' time use ', ' rapid growth ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' treatment effect ', ' non-drug ', ' nondrug ', ' population health ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' trend analysis ', ' Time trend ', ' Temporal trend ', ' Trends over time ', ' venous thromboembolism ', ' safety outcomes ', ' cardiovascular effects ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,561787,PA-03
"Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development ABSTRACT Opioid use during pregnancy has increased dramatically in the past decade, and may pose significant health challenges for the rapidly growing number of exposed infants born to mothers using illicit and/or prescribed opioids. Prenatal opioid exposure (OE) is inconsistently related to impaired neurobehavior, attention, and cognition in infancy and childhood, suggesting persistent, potentially life-long, consequences. This fetal exposure occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, making it a critical period of vulnerability to environmental insult. However, little is known about the effects of OE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of OE on the development of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 1-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and postnatal environmental factors moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by OE; deficits in developing connections and networks mediate the negative effects of OE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; gender, other drugs and postnatal environment interact with OE to influence growth trajectories of rapidly developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the study team’s substantial research experience with mother-infant dyads with prenatal opioid and other drug exposures (Jones, Grewen), and on strong preliminary data showing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in neonatal functional connectivity due to prenatal opioids and other drugs (Grewen, Gao), and on associations between functional connections and behavioral effects (Grewen, Gao). The rationale for the proposed research is that longitudinal study will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural insult, infant gender and postnatal environment on developing functional connections. The hypotheses will be tested with 3 Specific Aims: 1) Quantify the extent to which OE impairs developing functional connections at 2 weeks and again at 12 months; 2) Determine the extent to which the effects of OE on neurobehavior, attention, self-regulation and cognition are related to developmental trajectories of functional connections; 3) Determine how infant gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and a Cumulative Environmental Risk Index moderate the effects of OE on developing connectivity. This approach is innovative because it will employ hypothesis-driven analyses as well as novel, exploratory data-driven and machine learning methods to quantify direct and interactive effects of OE and other drug exposures on functional circuitry. The proposed research is significant because rates of prenatal OE and NAS have increased 5-fold since 2000, in parallel with the opioid epidemic, and because knowledge gleaned has potential to identify factors that may protect or further harm growing functional networks underlying nascent cognitive abilities in this at-risk group. NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal opioid and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. At a broader level, this work is relevant to understanding brain mechanisms underlying developing attention/arousal systems and how these brain-behavior connections may be altered by biological or environmental challenges. It is relevant to public health because the number of women using opioids during pregnancy is rapidly growing, in parallel with the current opioid epidemic. This research is relevant to NIDA’s mission because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population--infants exposed in utero.",Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development,10197069,R01DA043678,"['Alcohols ', ' Alcohol

"Data science tools to identify robust exposure-phenotype associations for precision medicine Project Summary/Abstract Phenotypic variability across demographically diverse populations are driven by environmental factors. The overall goal of this proposal is to deploy data science approaches to drive discovery of associations between exposures (E) and phenotypes (P) in demographically diverse populations. We lack data science methods to associate, replicate, and prioritize exposure variables of the exposome (E) in phenotypes (P) and disease incidence (D), required for the delivery of precision medicine. Observational studies are fraught with 4 unsolved data science challenges. First, E-based studies are: (1) limited to associating a few hypothesized exposure- phenotype pairs (E-P) at a time, leading to a fragmented literature of environmental associations. Machine learning (ML) approaches for feature selection and prediction hold promise, however, (2) most extant E-based cohorts contain missing data, challenging the use of ML to detect complex E-P associations, Third, (3) biases, such as confounding and study design influence associations and hinder translation. Fourth, (4) there are few well-powered data resources that systematically document longitudinal E-P and E-D associations across massive precision medicine. It is a challenge to systematically associate a number of exposures in multiple phenotypes and replicate these associations across cohorts. (Aim 1). The “vibration of effects”, or the degree to which associations change as a function of study design (e.g., analytic method, sample size) and model choice is a hidden bias in observational studies (Aim 2). Third, an outstanding question is the degree to which environmental differences lead to health disparities. To address these challenges and gaps, we propose to Aim 1: develop and test machine learning methods to associate multiple environmental exposure indicators with multiple phenotypes: EP-WAS. We hypothesize that exposures will explain a significant amount of variation in phenotype in populations and will deposit all data and models in a novel EP-WAS Catalog. Aim 2: Quantitate how study design influences associations between exposure biomarkers and phenotype. We will scale up, extend, and test a method called “vibration of effects” (VoE) to measure how study criteria influences the stability of associations (how reproducible associations are as a function of analytic choice). Aim 3. Leverage EP-WAS and VoE to disentangle biological, demographic, and environmental influences of phenotypic disparities in hypercholesterolemia. We will deploy EP-WAS and VoE packaged libraries in the largest cohort study to partition phenotypic variation across demographic groups in factors for hypercholesterolemia. We will equip the biomedical community with data science approaches for robust data-driven discovery and interpretation of exposure-phenotype factors in observational datasets, required for the identification of environmental health disparities. For the first time, investigators will ascertain the collective role of the environment in heart disease at scale just in time for the All of Us program. Project Narrative Massive observational cohorts with the exposome (ie, multiple environmental factors) and phenome (disease risk factors) are being assembled by countries worldwide. We will equip the biomedical community with data science and machine learning tools for robust data-driven imputation, discovery, interpretation, and re-use of complex exposure-phenotype associations that emerge from big data. Applications of our methods will address several high-priority goals for the National Institutes of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) including identification of environmental health disparities in heart disease that are critical for precision medicine implementation.",Data science tools to identify robust exposure-phenotype associations for precision medicine,10095924,R01ES032470,"['Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' NHANES ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' catalog ', ' Catalogs ', ' Pollution ', ' Complex ', ' Country ', ' vibration ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Diet and Nutrition ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Process ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' NIEHS ', ' disease phenotype ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' phenome ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' Data Science ', ' health difference ', ' differences in health ', ' data resource ', ' All of Us Research Program ', ' All of Us Program ', ' All of Us Research Project ', ' AoURP ', ' deep learning ', ' feature selection ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' environmental health disparity ', ' disease disparity ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiology ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' hypercholesterolemia ', ' Hypercholesteremia ', ' high blood cholesterol ', ' Incidence ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Libraries ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Measures ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' ']",NIEHS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2021,697752,MA-07
"Trio Analysis of Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Integrated Bioinformatics Genomics Study (TRIOS) PROJECT SUMMARY Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) affects up to 5% of couples, yet nearly half of cases remain unexplained by current testing recommendations. Euploid pregnancy loss, in the setting of unexplained RPL, is particularly frustrating for patients and providers because there is no clear explanation or any proven therapies to mitigate risk of subsequent miscarriages. As clinical presentation and subsequent pregnancy outcomes vary widely, this complex disorder will ultimately require a precision health approach. While more than 3000 human genes are conserved and likely essential for early development, remarkably little is known about their contribution to RPL and current genetic databases are essentially devoid of RPL entries. Moreover, there is currently no database that annotates phenotypes and genotypes of these essential genes. This proposal aims to define genetic determinants of RPL through clinical and molecular phenotyping and genomic sequencing of a large RPL cohort, combined with novel bioinformatics and machine learning approaches to derive predictive risk algorithms. A comprehensive approach to identify genomic markers of pregnancy loss by whole genome sequencing of well- characterized RPL trios (mother-father-pregnancy loss) will be undertaken in Aim 1. These genetics efforts will be paired in Aim 2 with metabolomic, lipidomic and single cell transcriptomic profiling preconception and in early pregnancy. Leveraged with innovative machine learning strategies in Aim 3, this approach will significantly advance understanding of the genetic underpinnings of unexplained RPL. A clinical ‘intolerome’ database will be constructed in Aim 4 to facilitate worldwide collaboration and curation of genotypes and associated phenotypes, making the genetics and omics data and results available to the public as well as other funded teams. This multidisciplinary team includes leaders in RPL, genetics, genomics, prenatal diagnosis, bioinformatics and machine learning at Stanford, UCSF and OHSU. Combined we have a substantial cohort of RPL patients that will serve as a robust recruitment source, along with a collaboration with the unique UK Pregnancy Baby BioBank of existing trios to accomplish project goals. The proposed study is anticipated to have significant clinical and research impact by identifying the genomic contribution to RPL in a large and well phenotyped cohort and building improved risk predictions based on machine learning incorporating clinical, genetic, and molecular data. This work will lay the foundation for precision medicine-based interventions for RPL couples who are difficult to diagnose and have few proven treatments. PROJECT NARRATIVE Given that there are very few proven treatments for unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss, uncovering genetic mechanisms is crucial for identifying individuals at risk and initiating targeted, patient-centered treatments. The proposed work will provide unprecedented machine learning analysis to define the spectrum of genomic and clinical indicators for recurrent pregnancy loss, unparalleled molecular phenotyping through metabolomics and single cell RNA sequencing, and development of a publicly-available “intolerome” database which will provide the foundation for a future prenatal OMIM.",Trio Analysis of Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Integrated Bioinformatics Genomics Study (TRIOS),10225966,R01HD105256,"['Spontaneous abortion ', ' Miscarriage ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Circulation ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Couples ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Fathers ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Hematology ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Mothers ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy Outcome ', ' Prenatal Diagnosis ', ' Antenatal Diagnosis ', ' Intrauterine Diagnosis ', ' antepartum diagnosis ', ' intra-uterine diagnosis ', ' Recommendation ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' reproductive system disorder ', ' Genital Disorders ', ' Reproductive System Disease ', ' reproductive disease ', ' reproductive disorder ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' catalog ', ' Catalogs ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Essential Genes ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' novel ', ' Pregnancy loss ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' reproductive ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' Genetic Data Banks ', ' Genetic Data Bases ', ' Genetic Databanks ', ' Genetic Information Databases ', ' Genetic Databases ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' genetic determinant ', ' Genetic Determinism ', ' OMIM ', ' Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man ', ' Provider ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' molecular profile ', ' molecular signature ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Seminal ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' genome wide association study ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' treatment center ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Heritability ', ' transcriptomics ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' molecular phenotype ', ' molecular marker ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' exome sequencing ', ' exome-seq ', ' risk variant ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk allele ', ' risk gene ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk loci ', ' risk locus ', ' Structural Congenital Anomalies ', ' Structural Birth Defect ', ' congenital structural malformation ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' Genetic study ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' genomic biomarker ', ' genomic marker ', ' phenotypic data ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' adverse pregnancy outcome ', ' recruit ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' Precision Health ', ' early pregnancy ', ' Multiomic Data ', ' multiple omic data ', ' genomic locus ', ' gene locus ', ' genetic locus ', ' data repository ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' lipidomics ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,1465292,CA-18
"Social Determinants of Health and Novel Prediction of Cardiovascular Health from Young Adulthood to Middle Age in the CARDIA Study Project Summary In the U.S., approximately 840,000 Americans die from cardiovascular disease (CVD) each year. The prevalence of CVD is on the rise and widespread disparities in CVD exist across economic, racial, and ethnic groups. In order to address the rising prevalence of CVD and persistent disparities, there has been a shift in focus to public health strategies addressing cardiovascular health (CVH). CVH is a broader and more positive construct beyond the absence of CVD. Despite this recent focus on improving CVH, widespread disparities still exist. Social determinants of health (SDOH) may be important contributors to these continued disparities. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines SDOH as the “structural determinants and conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age.” There has been limited work in studying how a diverse set of SDOH change over time and perform in the prediction of CVH. To address this need, we will identify patterns of SDOH exposure over time and determine if the addition of SDOH variables allows for better prediction of an individual's CVH status. The primary hypothesis is that a diverse set of SDOH will be associated with and improve the prediction of CVH, independent of baseline CVH and other covariates. To examine this hypothesis, we will pursue the following Specific Aims: 1) identify patterns of SDOH exposure up to age 50 and define exposure subgroups and 2) determine whether overall and domain-specific patterns of SDOH exposures from young adulthood to middle age, identified in Aim 1, are associated with and improve the prediction of CVH and its component metrics. We will utilize the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, a prospective cohort study with detailed information on cardiovascular risk factors and disease in a geographically and racially diverse sample of young adults. In Aim 1, we will use a novel sequential pattern mining method to identify the associations among SDOH and determine the SDOH exposure patterns from baseline to age 50. The Aim 1 SDOH exposure definitions will be included as predictors of CVH at age 50 and beyond using supervised machine learning techniques. By including SDOH in predictive models, health services professionals and clinicians may have an improved understanding of patients at high-risk for low CVH and may better tailor social and clinical interventions to each patient's needs. If awarded, this fellowship will allow me to contribute novel research to the SDOH and cardiovascular health fields, gain competency in new research skills, and improve my writing and presentation skills. The completion of this project and training will prepare me for my long-term career goal of becoming an independent research scientist in an academic setting, studying SDOH and using data science and informatics tools to improve public health. Project Narrative The incorporation of social determinants of health (SDOH) in predictive models for cardiovascular health (CVH) may help health services professionals and clinicians in identifying patients at high-risk for low CVH. This has important public health implications because social and clinical interventions may be tailored to each patient's needs. This research may also help to identify which SDOH are predictive of CVH from young adulthood to middle age, allowing public health professionals to target specific SDOH through directed social, behavioral, and policy-related interventions.",Social Determinants of Health and Novel Prediction of Cardiovascular Health from Young Adulthood to Middle Age in the CARDIA Study,10067371,F31HL151178,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Ethnic People ', ' Ethnic Population ', ' Ethnicity People ', ' Ethnicity Population ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Fellowship ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Health Services ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methods ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' Mining ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Identification ', ' Social Identity ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' socio-economic factors ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Writing ', ' Measures ', ' Competence ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Policies ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Healthy diet ', ' balanced diet ', ' good diet ', ' age group ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' social ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' BMI ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Subgroup ', ' Smoking Status ', ' sex ', ' Behavioral ', ' Health Professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' fasting plasma glucose ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' health economics ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' social health determinants ', ' Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study ', ' Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' built environment ', ' training opportunity ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' Data Science ', ' biracial ', ' bi-racial ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' Prospective cohort study ', ' secondary analysis ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' informatics tool ', ' social factors ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,F31,2021,41249,IL-07
"Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology OVERALL : ABSTRACT This is the third competing continuation for an accomplished Environmental Health Sciences Core Center (EHS CC), The Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology (CEET) at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn). The Director is Trevor M. Penning, PhD (The Thelma Brown and Henry Charles Molinoff Professor of Pharmacology) and the Deputy Director is Rebecca A. Simmons, MD (The Hallam Hurt Endowed Professor in Pediatrics). The Center is comprised of 71 members from 18 Departments and 5 Schools, with almost equal representation of basic and clinician-scientists drawn from the Perelman School of Medicine (PSOM) and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). The CEET has built an institutional, regional and national identity in environmental health sciences (EHS) in the absence of a School of Public Health and Department of EHS at Penn. The synergistic combination of basic and clinician-scientists within the CEET promotes translational environmental health research that addresses fundamental questions and translates knowledge into action to have a major impact on human health and disease consistent with the NIEHS Strategic Plan. The CEET mission is to “elucidate the mechanistic links between environmental exposures and human disease, and translate findings into action to improve the health of vulnerable individuals, and local, national, and global communities”. This mission is accomplished through five aims. In Aim 1: We use a flexible thematic area structure to conduct translational environmental health research to improve precision public health. Our current themes are in Air Pollution & Lung Health; Environmental Exposures & Cancer; Windows-of- Susceptibility; and Environmental Neuroscience. Each thematic area integrates the pillars or exposure science, adverse outcome constructs (pathways and networks) to explain the phenome with translation to communities and human subjects. In Aim 2: We conduct bi-directional communication with communities in S.E and N.E. Pennsylvania and use community engagement to set the research agenda for the CEET. In Aim 3: We provide a facility core structure to promote precision public health. Our Integrative Health Sciences Facility Core is adept in human subject study design and in conducting population exposure services, using cartographic modeling, GIS tools and biosensors. Biomarkers of exposure and effect are measured in our Translational Biomarker Core which conducts mass spectrometric assays at a level of precision and accuracy difficult to emulate elsewhere. The Exposure Biology Informatics Core brings to bear the power of computation, machine learning and AI to predict the toxicity of unknowns and integrate Big-data sets to recognize patterns in “omics” data and predict adverse outcomes. In Aim 4: We build capacity in environmental health sciences by funding pilot projects to Early Stage Investigators (ESI) and to senior investigators conducting environmental health research for the first time. In Aim 5: We cultivate the careers of ESI through a transformative Environmental Health Scientist Support Program that provides mentoring, grant proposal review, environmental health and Facility Core workshops. OVERALL : NARRATIVE The Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology (CEET) conducts research that links environmental exposures, to adverse outcomes and translates its findings to human subjects and communities to identify the most vulnerable and improve prevention, intervention and treatment through precision public health.

"Complex Mixtures of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals in Relation to Cognitive Development Project Summary/Abstract Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) include multiple classes of chemicals that have been used extensively in consumer products. Mounting evidence from toxicological and epidemiological studies suggest EDCs are developmental neurotoxicants, and EDC exposure during the critical in utero period is associated with adverse child cognitive development. Unfortunately, current research focuses on individual EDCs and largely ignores joint and interactive effects of EDCs and the overall effect of the EDC mixture. To assess exposure to multiple EDCs simultaneously, one must consider the high dimensionality of the exposure matrix and the complex correlation structures across chemicals in statistical analyses. To address limitations of existing methods, we propose to adapt a robust technique that is well-established for pattern recognition and dimensionality reduction in machine learning. We specifically aim to use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a type of robust Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization, to determine the patterns of exposure to four ubiquitous classes of EDCs known to cross the placenta—polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), phenols (e.g., bisphenol A), and phthalates—and to characterize the relationship between these exposure patterns and cognitive development. LDA is empirically-driven so that the researcher does not need to specify a priori the number of patterns, and the non-negativity constraint enhances the interpretability of the patterns identified. For our health model, we will use a supervised approach that allows child cognitive scores to inform the LDA solution, thereby enabling identification of patterns most relevant to the outcome. We will conduct this work using the existing infrastructure of the Columbia Center for Children’s Environmental Health Mothers and Newborns Study, a longitudinal birth cohort of mother-child dyads. We will also establish reproducibility of the method by creating a user-friendly R package so that other researchers can easily apply LDA in environmental epidemiology, and we will verify transferability and functionality of the method on a separate cohort. This will be the first study to assess the interacting and overall effects of multiple EDCs on child cognitive development, introducing LDA as a straight-forward tool for the analysis of complex mixtures in epidemiology. If successful, this method has broader implications for environmental epidemiology, as it can easily be applied to other environmental mixtures of interest. The activities encompassed by this proposal (study design, data management, advanced statistics, machine learning, data science, and presentation of findings) cover the set of fundamental research skills required by a scientist entering the interdisciplinary field of environmental epidemiology in the era of Big Data and Precision Public Health. The applied experience gained from carrying out this research, in combination with didactic training and individual cross-disciplinary mentoring, comprises a comprehensive research training plan that will serve as a platform from which to launch a career as an independent investigator in environmental epidemiology. Project Narrative This study will be the first to determine existing patterns of cross-class endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) exposure in utero and to evaluate their association with child cognitive development, assessing potentially non- linear independent effects, non-additive interactions, and the overall effect of the mixture. This will help to identify environmental risk factors most amenable to public health interventions and inform future researchers and policy makers about concurrent exposure to EDCs in a vulnerable population The adaptation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for pattern identification and dimension reduction in environmental epidemiology integrates data science and machine learning into environmental health research, which is novel and extremely relevant to public health, as LDA can be easily applied to other environmental mixtures and co-exposures of interest.",Complex Mixtures of

"Machine learning approaches towards risk assessment and prediction of adverse pregnancy outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY The primary objectives of this project include understanding the interplay between molecular, genetic and clinical factors related to adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs), method development for accurate risk assessment of APOs well before they occur, and method development for collecting additional clinical data in routine treatment of at-risk-subjects. Towards these goals we have assembled a team of investigators with clinical, translational, and computational expertise capable of identifying novel contributors to APOs as well as facilitating clinician-patient interactions using data-driven and theoretically sound machine learning approaches. Our strategies will rely on advanced machine learning as well as integration of clinical, genetic, and molecular data and hold promise to bring precision medicine to the treatment and experience of women during and post pregnancy. We will predominantly rely on the data collected during the national “Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: monitoring mothers-to-be”; i.e., the nuMoM2b study.

"HERCULES: Exposome Research Center PROJECT SUMMARY: HERCULES The vision of the HERCULES P30 is to demonstrably advance the role of environmental health sciences in clinical and public health settings using the platform of the exposome. Healthcare and biomedical research have become increasingly genome-centric. While much of this is due to the impressive achievements in genomics, which have consistently outpaced gains in environmental health, it is our contention that a more persuasive case needs to be made for environmental factors. Science and intuition support the idea that the environment plays just as large of a role as genetics for the majority of diseases. The exposome, which embraces a strategy and scale similar to genomic research, is poised to elevate the environment in discussions of health and disease. We will continue to grow and enhance the environmental health science research portfolio at Emory through cutting-edge technologies and innovative data solutions. We will build upon the superb relationships we have built with the local community and continue to push the mission of NIEHS on campus and across the scientific landscape. Based on the extraordinary progress over our first three years, we propose to retain our theme to use exposome-related concepts and approaches to improve human health. This simple and unifying vision will continue to stimulate discovery, promote collaboration, and enhance communication through the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To marshal physical and intellectual resources to support exposome-related approaches (high-resolution metabolomics, analytical chemistry, systems biology, machine learning, bioinformatics, high-throughput toxicology, and spatial and temporal statistical models) through cores, pilot funding, mentoring, and research forums. Specific Aim 2. To make major contributions towards exposome and environmental health science research. Specific Aim 3. To provide career development activities around innovative and emerging concepts and approaches related to the exposome. Specific Aim 4. To enhance and expand existing relationships with community partners to resolve environmental health issues in the community using exposome principles. Specific Aim 5. To provide infrastructure and resources to facilitate rapid translation of novel scientific findings into the development of prevention and treatment strategies in humans. Pursuit of HERCULES' aims will advance environmental health sciences within our institutions and in the scientific community. PROJECT NARRATIVE: HERCULES Human health and disease is dictated by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.

"Human Exposure and Vulnerability to Manganese Contaminated Groundwater Project Summary / Abstract Manganese (Mn) is a naturally-occurring metal contaminant found in water supplies throughout the world. Although research using small samples (< 400 observations) from Bangladesh, China and Canada suggests that excessive consumption of Mn is neurotoxic in infants and young children, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) classifies Mn only as a secondary contaminant. Thus, Mn is not subject to mandatory monitoring in public water systems, let alone private wells, which serve over 2 million Californians while remaining unregulated and untreated. To reconcile the gap between epidemiological evidence and regulatory action, we propose this timely research. Our project, which takes California’s private wells as a focal point for its investigation, has three specific aims: to identify (1) areas at high risk of exposure to Mn in drinking water (2) the socioeconomic characteristics of communities at high-risk of Mn exposure, and (3) the degree of association between Mn exposure and the health outcomes of infants and young children. While treatment for Mn-contaminated water is technologically straightforward, access may depend on a community’s socioeconomic and political status; thus, there is danger of Mn silently amplifying health inequalities. The ​broader, long-term objectives of this research are (I) to encourage further analyses of Mn exposure in California by developing a statewide publicly-available dataset from groundwater Mn data, and (II) to develop a ​causal ​framework for a primary-sample study of Mn effects on infant and child health. California enforces the US EPA’s secondary contaminant standard of 50 µg L​-1 but only in community water systems. Non-transient, non-community water systems (e.g. schools and hospitals) and private wells are exempt. In recent years, the US Geological Survey (USGS) has found Mn concentrations above the health-based target of 300 µg L​-1 in California’s wells. ​The proposed research will indicate whether and to what extent Mn affects child health and contributes to health disparities. As such, it is aligned with the NIEHS mission to determine how environmental exposures affect humans in order to promote healthier lives. To achieve the first aim of identifying areas at high risk of exposure to unsafe concentrations of Mn, we will use a machine learning model on subsurface flow and groundwater chemistry to predict Mn concentrations in the Central Valley, Los Angeles, Central Coast and West Coast Basins; then, we will overlay the Mn prediction grid with ZIP code and school district polygons to identify the areas that emerge with more than a 50% chance of exposure to Mn at the secondary standard as high-risk. For the second aim, we will determine if high-risk areas are distinguished from low-risk areas by their socioeconomic status and demographics using two-sample t-tests. For the third aim, we will run least squares regressions of birth weight, grade-by-school test scores and chronic absenteeism rates on predicted Mn exposure with controls for chemical confounds, socioeconomic status and demographic characteristics. Project Narrative The impact of manganese (Mn) on population health is an under-investigated problem in the United States relative to the wide prevalence and frequent detections of the chemical above safe concentrations in groundwater basins throughout the country. In line with NIEHS priorities to better understand environmental health disparities and to aid in securing environmental justice, we propose to correct this knowledge gap by undertaking a substantial investigation into the prevalence of Mn in California’s private wells, and examining the shared characteristics of communities most likely to be exposed to unsafe levels of manganese in drinking water. By also performing a preliminary investigation of the relationship between Mn exposure and child cognitive health, our study will provide an initial assessment of the public health threat from Mn, highlight the most vulnerable communities, and inform regulatory agencies seeking to review drinking water standards for Mn.",Human Exposure and Vulnerability to Manganese Contaminated Groundwater,10200044,R21ES030807,"['Absenteeism ', ' Affect ', ' Asia ', ' Bangladesh ', ' Birth Weight ', ' California ', ' Canada ', ' Chemistry ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' China ', ' Mainland China ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Esthetics ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infant ', ' Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' low birth weight ', ' low birth weight infant human ', ' low birthweight ', ' Least-Squares Analysis ', ' Least Squares ', ' Least-Squares Analyses ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Manganese ', ' Mn element ', ' Maps ', ' Metals ', ' Mission ', ' Oxygen ', ' O element ', ' O2 element ', ' Politics ', ' Poverty ', ' Impoverished ', ' Privatization ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Schools ', ' Students ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' United States Environmental Protection Agency ', ' Environmental Protection Agency ', ' Vital Statistics ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Water Supply ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Infant Health ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Micronutrients ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Dependence ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' grade school ', ' elementary school ', ' groundwater ', ' ground water ', ' drinking water ', ' novel ', ' Impaired health ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' NIEHS ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Natural experiment ', ' Consumption ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' neurotoxic ', ' infant outcome ', ' exposed human population ', ' human exposure ', ' demographics ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' high risk ', ' health inequalities ', ' Health Inequity ', ' Inequalities in Health ', ' Inequities in Health ', ' environmental justice ', ' population health ', ' Secure ', ' Geological Survey ', ' Geology Survey ', ' geological applications ', ' geological characterization ', ' geology characterization ', ' school district ', ' contaminated water ', ' Water contamination ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' Child Health ', ' econometrics ', ' environmental health disparity ', ' geochemistry ', ' geochemical ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE,R21,2021,183893,CA-41
"Air Pollution and Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias: A National Study Dementia is a major public health challenge with substantial economic and social burden, affecting more than 47 million people worldwide. Alzheimer's disease (AD) constitutes about two-thirds of dementia cases and is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, and the only diagnosis among the top 10 that cannot be cured. There is a pressing need to support Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) patients by identifying novel and modifiable risk factors that may reduce morbidity. Emerging evidence suggests that air pollution – in particular fine particulate matter (PM2.5) – plays an important role in AD/ADRD pathogenesis. However, little is known about the relative contributions of different air pollutants (PM2.5, NO2, ozone), nor about PM2.5 components. To facilitate the targeting of pollution control efforts, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have placed a high priority on determining which air pollutants and/or which components of PM2.5 are most toxic. In addition, one major gap in the emerging epidemiologic evidence on air pollution and AD/ADRD morbidity is that many previous studies have relied on hospitalizations as the measure of morbidity. Yet, hospitalization is not the typical course for AD/ADRD diagnosis and initial treatment. Instead, if it does occur for patients, hospitalization happens during the more advanced stages of the disease and usually for treating complications of the disease. Thus, hospitalization records do not accurately reflect disease incidence, and thus underestimate case numbers. Therefore, we propose a study that will leverage the massive datasets of high-resolution environmental exposure data and Medicare claims (including doctor visits where most AD/ADRD diagnoses would occur) across the contiguous US to better understand the influence of air pollution on AD/ADRD morbidity among US elderly, and identify potential vulnerable subpopulations, with the ultimate goal of informing environmental policy. We will (1) generate and validate a comprehensive, high- resolution, multiple-species, air pollution dataset across the contiguous US for 2000-2021, including criteria air pollutants (PM2.5 mass, NO2, and ozone), PM2.5 components (including trace metals), as well as aerosol water and fine particle pH that may influence metal dissolution; (2) estimate the chronic effects of criteria pollutants (PM2.5, NO2, and ozone) on AD/ADRD risks using the nationwide Medicare Chronic Conditions Warehouse (CCW) database, which includes Medicare inpatient and outpatient claims, doctor visits, skilled nursing facility, and home health-care claims for AD/ADRD among ~100 million Medicare beneficiaries; (3) assess the relative contributions of PM2.5 components and potential effect modification by aerosol water/pH on AD/ADRD risks using the nationwide Medicare cohort; and (4) conduct sensitivity analyses by correcting for exposure measurement error and outcome misclassification. Our proposed research will fill major knowledge gaps in the epidemiology of environmental exposures and AD/ADRD morbidity, and inform policy for targeted source-specific regulations and facilitate actionable measures that can prevent or mitigate the AD health burden due to air pollution. Project Narrative We will use advanced statistical methods to quantify the evidence of associations between ambient air pollution and AD/ADRD to better frame environmental policy. Leveraging national datasets capturing over 100 million Medicare beneficiaries, we will assess multiple types of air pollutants, including criteria air pollutants (PM2.5, NO2, and ozone) and various PM2.5 chemical components. This work will fill major gaps in the epidemiology of environmental exposures and AD/ADRD morbidity, which can inform policy for targeted source-specific regulations with the greatest health protection that can potentially mitigate the AD/ADRD health burden due to air pollution.",Air Pollution and Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias: A National Study,10301914,R01AG074357,"['Aerosols ', ' Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Air Pollutants ', ' Air Pollution ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Ammonia ', ' Biological Availability ', ' Bioavailability ', ' Biologic Availability ', ' Physiologic Availability ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Gases ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Home Care Services ', ' Domiciliary Care ', ' home health care ', ' home healthcare ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Incidence ', ' Inpatients ', ' Learning ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Metals ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' United States National Academy of Sciences ', ' National Academy of Sciences ', ' Nitrogen Dioxide ', ' NO2 ', ' Nitrogen Peroxide ', ' Noise ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Ozone ', ' O3 ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Skilled Nursing Facilities ', ' Extended Care Facilities ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Thermodynamics ', ' Thermodynamic ', ' Time ', ' Toxicology ', ' United States ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Work ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Measures ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Individual ', ' Bayesian Method ', ' Bayesian Methodology ', ' Bayesian Statistical Method ', ' Bayesian approaches ', ' Bayesian classification method ', ' Bayesian classification procedure ', ' Bayesian posterior distribution ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Environmental Policy ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Exposure to ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Knowledge ', ' cognitive function ', ' Pollution ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Visit ', ' 65+ years old ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' old age ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' cohort ', ' pollutant ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' novel ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Reporting ', ' Trace metal ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Acidity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Environmental Epidemiology ', ' Update ', ' sex ', ' Modification ', ' beneficiary ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' Health protection ', ' neuroinflammation ', ' neuroinflammatory ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' modifiable risk ', ' malleable risk ', ' high risk ', ' Medicare claim ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' ambient air pollution ', ' outdoor air pollution ', ' fine particles ', ' PM2.5 ', ' fine particulate matter ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' data warehouse ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' dementia risk ', ' risk factor for dementia ', ' risk for dementia ', ' systemic inflammatory response ', ' systemic inflammation ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,732182,GA-05
"Vascular Contributions to Cognitive Impairment after Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes: the nuMoM2b-Heart Health Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) are now recognized as a key pathogenic factor in dementia, and represent a promising target for intervention. Adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs), such as preeclampsia, preterm delivery, and fetal growth restriction, are associated with future maternal cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk. However, the impact of APOs on maternal VCID remains unexamined. Most existing women's cardiovascular and aging cohorts lack rigorously phenotyped, prospectively collected pregnancy data, and the impact of maternal factors that may predispose to both APOs and VCID is not well understood. From 2010-2013, the Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study Monitoring Mothers-to-be (nuMoM2b) study enrolled a diverse cohort of 10,037 healthy women at 8 US academic medical centers, who were followed from early in conception through the delivery of their first child. Several years later, the Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-be Heart Health Study (nuMoM2b-HHS) brought back 4,475 nuMoM2b women for a second study wave, to characterize subsequent pregnancy outcomes and accumulation of cardiovascular risk factors following pregnancy. A third study wave of in-person visits will begin in early 2022. In this ancillary study, we propose to conduct neurocognitive assessments on all nuMoM2b-HHS participants during this third study wave. We will perform brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on a sub-cohort of 250 women followed at the Columbia University Irving Medical Center study site, including all who experienced APOs in the index pregnancy. The overall goal of the study is to capitalize on this unique obstetric cohort to determine the impact of APOs on long term maternal VCID, through the following specific aims: (1) Investigate the impact of APOs on maternal cognition 10-15 years after delivery by comparing global cognition scores between women who experienced APOs and women who did not; (2) Determine the impact of APOs on MRI biomarkers of maternal VCID, including white matter hyperintensity volume and additional markers of cerebral small vessel disease. We hypothesize that the association of APOs with VCID markers will be partially mediated by development of new hypertension after the index pregnancy. As an exploratory aim, we will use deep pregnancy phenotyping, including maternal characteristics, biomarkers of ischemic placental disease and APOs, to create a VCID prediction model. This will be the first US study to use prospectively collected pregnancy data to investigate the impact of APOs, a sex-specific vascular risk factor, on VCID in women. Understanding the effects of APOs on early markers of VCID could help us identify women early in life who are at higher risk of dementia, and develop preventive strategies to thwart the progression of cognitive decline in this population. In addition, the collection of neurocognitive assessments on the entire nuMoM2b-HHS cohort during this study wave is an important investment, which will provide baseline data for future studies as these women continue to age. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs), such as preeclampsia, preterm delivery, and fetal growth restriction, are associated with future maternal cerebrovascular risk; however, the impact of APOs on vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) in women remains unexamined, and the effects of factors that may predispose to both APOs and VCID are not well understood.

"Harnessing ""omics"": A Systems Biology approach to discovery of biologicalpathways in placental development and parturition PROJECT SUMMARY  Our  goal  in  this  proposal  is  to  identify  biological  networks  involved  in  synchronizing  placental  growth  and  maturity. To accomplish this goal, we have established a collaborative effort between the Center for Prevention  of  Preterm  Birth  at  Cincinnati  Children’s  Hospital  Medical  Center  (CCHMC)  and  the  Institute  for  Systems  Biology (ISB) in Seattle to conduct a systems level analysis of “omics” data. Perturbed growth and maturity can  lead  to  placental  insufficiency,  which  underlies  a  significant  proportion  of  adverse  pregnancy  outcomes,  such  as preterm birth.  A paucity of knowledge regarding normal placental development and maturity greatly hinders  any  study  of  placental  insufficiency.  Placental  growth  and  development  occurs  throughout  gestation  and  reaches maturity at term. Therefore, it is critical to identify the networks involved and to assess them over the  length of gestation. Our central hypothesis is that key biological networks vital to placental growth and  maturity  can  be  identified  through  the  intersection  of  transcriptomic,  proteomic,  and  metabolomics  data  from  term  and  preterm  placentae.  Furthermore,  utilizing  longitudinal  proteomics  and  metabolomics  data,  we  can  determine  how  those  pathways  change  over  gestation  and  differ  between  normal  and  preterm  placentae. We will test this hypothesis through the following aims:   Aim  1:  Identification  of  key  gene  and  metabolite  signatures

"Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD Prenatal levels of organophosphorus pesticide (OPs) biomarkers have been associated with hallmark symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), including deficits in working memory, social responsiveness, and ADHD indices. Cross-sectional studies have also linked concurrent pyrethroid pesticide metabolites with ADHD and ADHD behaviors in children. Toxicology studies report mixture effects for these pesticides on health outcomes. Three major gaps exist in this literature: 1) No studies have evaluated prenatal and childhood exposures to these pesticides and clinical ADHD diagnoses. 2) Prenatal epidemiological studies of OPs/pyrethroids typically rely on urinary DAP biomarkers, which reflect ingestion of both non-toxic metabolites and toxic parent pesticides. Urinary biomarkers from spot urine samples also do not characterize pregnancy-wide exposures, since OPs and pyrethroids are rapidly metabolized. 3) Studies of pesticide mixtures in epidemiology are scarce, and use of biomarkers for such mixtures analysis is problematic. For instance, administration of chlorpyrifos (an OP) results in increased tissue concentrations of cypermethrin while reducing urinary excretion of the pyrethroid metabolite 3-phenoxbenzoic acid. Thus, the mixture itself may affect biomarker levels and increase exposure misclassification. A geospatial framework for pesticide exposure can address some of the limitations of urinary biomarkers: exposures from agricultural pesticide applications can be estimated for an entire pregnancy rather than a few days; estimates reflect the toxic parent pesticide rather than non-toxic OP metabolites; and estimates reflect actual exposures rather than a post-metabolism level. However, geospatial (GIS) methods of pesticide exposure assessment for epidemiology in the US have only been done in California, and usually rely on distance-to-field measures. GIS exposure may be enhanced with drift models that incorporate heat, humidity, inversions, atmospheric stability, and wind, while external validity may be increased by studying a population outside of California. We propose to assess the relationship between OPs, pyrethroids, and ADHD in an Arizona population. To identify a study population, we will apply a validated phenotyping algorithm with exceptional diagnostics to Arizona Medicaid records to identify 4,000 childhood ADHD cases and 16,000 controls. In the mentored phase, the Candidate will develop geospatial, phenotyping, exposure assessment, mixture modeling (Bayesian Kernel Machine regression [BKMR]), and machine learning skills while constructing the case-control study. In the R00 phase, the Candidate will compare the drift model against traditional distance-to-field measures in a frequentist framework (Aim 2), and model associations between prenatal OP and pyrethroid pesticide mixtures and ADHD with BKMR (Aim 3). These results will expand GIS studies beyond California, contribute to sparse but critical literature on pesticide mixtures and neurodevelopment, and be among the first to report associations between GIS estimates of prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD case status. Public Health Relevance Statement/Narrative The goal of this career development award is to launch Dr. Melissa Furlong’s independent research career in environmental exposures and chronic disease epidemiology, with expertise in geospatial and dispersion modeling. In the research phase, Dr. Furlong will estimate associations between prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD, and will also estimate whether two classes of pesticides exhibit synergistic interaction effects. Findings from this proposal will provide some of the first estimates of associations between GIS-based estimates of pesticides and ADHD case status, and will contribute to a critical epidemiological literature on pesticide mixture effects and childhood neurodevelopment.",Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD,10250303,R00ES028743,"['Acids ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Agriculture ', ' agricultural ', ' Arizona ', ' Behavior Disorders ', ' behavioral disorder ', ' Birth Certificates ', ' California ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Chlorpyrifos ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Humidity ', ' indexing ', ' Literature ', ' Manuals ', ' Medicaid ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Mentors ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methods ', ' Odds Ratio ', ' Cross-Product Ratio ', ' Relative Odds ', ' Risk Ratio ', ' Parents ', ' Pesticides ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Toxicology ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Environmental Wind ', ' Wind ', ' cypermethrin ', ' supercypermethrin ', ' supermethrin ', ' Permethrin ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Excretory function ', ' excretion ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Ingestion ', ' Measurement ', ' Spottings ', ' Exposure to ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Performance ', ' pyrethroid ', ' early childhood ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' exposed in utero ', ' fetal exposure ', ' in utero exposure ', ' intra-uterine environmental exposure ', ' intrauterine environmental exposure ', ' prenatally exposed ', ' prenatal exposure ', ' case control ', ' Melissa ', ' AD/HD ', ' ADHD ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' urinary ', ' pesticide exposure ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Toxicant exposure ', ' toxic exposure ', ' public health relevance ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Learning Skill ', ' study population ', ' agricultural pesticide ', ' phenotyping algorithm ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R00,2021,249003,AZ-03
"Gene-Environment Interactions in Glaucoma Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the leading cause of chronic optic neuropathy and a major source of ocular morbidity worldwide. Understanding preclinical events, early phase disease and disease heterogeneity represent key objectives in early disease detection, prevention and treatment of POAG. In this study, we propose 4 specific aims. 1) We will perform both targeted and untargeted metabolome-wide association studies (MWAS) for POAG using pre-clinical serum from a large case-control group (500 cases and 500 controls) nested within ongoing prospective studies of the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), NHS2, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) to advance our understanding of the biochemical events that precede POAG diagnosis (blood was collected ~ 10 years prior to disease diagnosis). Prior studies suggest that nitric oxide metabolites represent genetically informed markers and will form the basis for targeted profiling. 2) While considerable discoveries have been made of POAG genes, more work is needed to leverage genome-wide information to inform POAG etiology. Thus, we will create a genome-wide genetic correlation matrix between POAG and complex traits previously linked to POAG, using data from the NEIGHBORHOOD (National Eye Institute Glaucoma Human Genetics Collaboration Heritable Overall Operational Database; 3800 POAG cases) consortium and publicly available summary genome-wide association study data. An assessment of the shared heritability between POAG and these traits as well as the relation between the genetic risk scores for these traits and POAG will lead to new etiologic insights. 3) New-onset POAG is clinically heterogeneous with variable visual field (VF) loss patterns that may reflect different etiologies. We will apply archetype analysis, which objectively quantifies a patient's VF loss pattern to 16 existing clinically validated archetypes (ATs), 9 of which are glaucomatous in nature. Each POAG case (n=1250 from NHS, NHS2 and HPFS) and10 matched controls will be assigned 16 weighted coefficients that add up to 1, with each value representing how consistent his / her VF loss pattern is with each glaucomatous AT. We will evaluate the differential relation between established POAG risk factors and the values on the 16 ATs, to identify unique risk factors for homogeneous incident POAG subtypes. 4) A carbohydrate-restricted diet may meet the energy requirement in the non-myelinated retinal ganglion cell axon segment of the optic nerve and reduce risk of POAG. We will conduct a prospective evaluation of this exposure in relation to POAG and POAG subtypes in the 3 cohorts (n=2100 cases). By integrating MWAS, genomics with prospective environmental exposure data and AT analysis, this proposal addresses a number of important knowledge gaps—in particular, it will shed light on how genetic and pre-diagnostic risk factors influence POAG and POAG heterogeneity. Linking specific exposures with POAG subtypes will provide important mechanistic understanding as well as evidence of causality, which will contribute to discovering precision medicine approaches for this condition. Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is an intraocular pressure-related chronic optic nerve disease that produces characteristic visual loss patterns. In this proposal we will study a host of genes, plasma metabolites and environmental factors in relation to POAG overall as well as it's objectively determined subtypes based on visual loss pattern. Understanding how these various exposures relate to POAG and it's subtypes will highlight disease prevention strategies and precision medical treatment options for this potentially blinding disease that requires lifetime management.",Gene-Environment Interactions in Glaucoma,10213030,R01EY015473,"['Acetyl Coenzyme A ', ' Acetyl CoA ', ' S-acetate Coenzyme A ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Archives ', ' Arginine ', ' L-Arginine ', ' Axon ', ' Biogenesis ', ' Origin of Life ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Carbohydrates ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Citrulline ', ' Control Groups ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Family ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Genes ', ' Glaucoma ', ' glaucomatous ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Physiologic Intraocular Pressure ', ' Intraocular Pressure ', ' Ocular Tension ', ' intra-ocular pressure ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Linkage Disequilibrium ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Morbidity -

"Neuromodulation of maternal immune adaptations in pregnancy PROJECT SUMMARY Pregnancy relies on finely-tuned adaptations of the maternal immune system to establish and maintain immune-tolerance to the semi-allogeneic fetus, which appear to be imbalanced in women experiencing complications, such as preterm birth. Outside the pregnancy context, the central nervous system can modulate systemic immunity via the sympathetic nervous system, while its role in modulating maternal immune system adaptations during pregnancy remains unknown. Understanding the determinants of immune regulation throughout pregnancy is a prerequisite to advance the early risk assessment and treatment of pathological pregnancies. This research project proposes to target the interaction between the brain, pregnancy, and the immune system. State-of-the-art immunology (mass cytometry) and neuroscience (neuromodulation of discrete neuronal circuitry) approaches will be combined to comprehensively investigate neuroimmune regulation of human term and preterm pregnancies and mouse models of pregnancy. Specifically, we hypothesize that a hyperactive sympathetic (adrenergic) tone enhances systemic pro-inflammatory monocyte responses, thereby contributing to a compromised fetal tolerance in preterm pregnancies. The first aim of this proposal will monitor the responsiveness innate pro-inflammatory monocytes to adrenergic signals (using single-cell high-dimensional mass cytometry), and the nervous-system associated proteome (e.g., adrenergic analytes, Brice Gaudilliere lab) throughout the human third trimester. This aim is based on my current expertise in human pregnancy immunology and multi-parameter approaches, and a continuation of my prior in-depth analyses of the pre-labor plasma signature and immunome in the last 100 days of healthy pregnancy, which accurately predict the onset of labor. In aim 2, to understand brain-pregnancy communication on a mechanistic level, neuroscience approaches (fiber photometry and chemogenetics) will be used under supervision of the Luis de Lecea lab, who pioneered cutting-edge neuro-modulatory techniques. Here, I will manipulate discrete neural populations, known to either suppress or enhance peripheral immunity, throughout late gestation in mouse pregnancies with the aim to monitor their link to peripheral monocyte responsiveness. Reciprocally, fiber photometry will track pregnancy- specific alterations in activity of these neural populations. In the third and final aim 3, I will determine whether monocyte responses to sympathetic signals differ throughout preterm vs. term pregnancies by analyzing maternal blood collected in each trimester of pregnancy, using high-dimensional single-cell mass cytometry. Machine learning approaches will be utilized to train a model for preterm vs. term sample classification. In the independent R00 phase, I envision to apply techniques from immunology and neuroscience to understand pregnancy biology and pathology from a central nervous system perspective. Together, the set of proposed studies will answer fundamental questions in the nascent field of brain- peripheral immunity cross-talk, and elucidate understudied mechanism of neuroimmunomodulation in pregnancy, while significantly aiding in my career development and academic transition to independence. PROJECT NARRATIVE Pregnancy relies on finely-tuned maternal immune adaptations to establish and maintain immune-tolerance to the semi- allogeneic fetus, which appear to be disrupted in women experiencing complications, such as preterm birth. Outside the context of pregnancy, the central nervous system can modulate systemic immunity via sympathetic signals but strikingly, its role in modulating the maternal immune dynamics during pregnancy remains unknown. In this proposal, we will investigate whether sympathetic (adrenergic) signals regulate innate immune responses during mouse, and human term and preterm pregnancies, with the aim to elucidate neuroimmune mechanisms of brain-pregnancy interaction – a key step to advance the early risk assessment and treatment of pathological pregnancies.",Neuromodulation of maternal immune adaptations in
