"Multi Biomarker-based prediction tool development to determine risk of infections-related outcomes among severe blunt trauma patients Severe trauma injury renders patients vulnerable to infections and subsequent risk of infections-related outcomes, including multiple organ failure/dysfunction syndrome (MOF/MODS), a major cause of mortality and morbidity. Although it is well-established that infection is a major risk factor for MOF, not all patients who experience nosocomial infections develop MOF, highlighting the importance of considering the underlying molecular biological mechanisms of heterogeneity in susceptibility to MOF development after infections (ie. infections-related MOF). In current clinical practices, MOF-specific score systems based on physiological measurements such as the Denver and Marshall Scores are monitored and used to diagnose patients with MOF after its onset. Here we propose to build prediction models for infections-related MOF before its onset using molecular signatures in order to significantly increase prediction accuracy. Methods of rapid (ie. immediately after the detection of infection) and accurate identification of patients who are highly susceptible to infections- related outcomes are expected to aid in informed decision-making and ensuring appropriate delivery of preventative measures to control MOF incidence. Such methods may thus result in improved health of patients and reduced health care costs. This proposal aims to employ an unbiased computational approach to investigate genome-wide transcriptome profiles and develop a panel of biomarkers to predict infections-related MOF immediately after the detection of infection. Previous transcriptome studies in the context of infections often focus on patient responses to infection. In contrast, we propose to focus on biomarker panel development to predict a specific infections-related adverse outcome before it occurrs. Two Aims are proposed to predict the outcome of infections-related MOF among blunt trauma patients, a population that is highly susceptible to infections. Aim 1: using blood samples from the Inflammation and the Host Response to Injury Study (“Glue Grant”), we will utilize our early blood transcriptome multi-biomarker development machine learning pipeline to build models for prediction of infections-related MOF outcome among a cohort of blunt trauma patients. Aim 2: we will build prediction models using injury severity scores and other common demographic and clinical variables for infections-related MOF and compare their performance with the multi-biomarker model. We hypothesize that, in comparison to models based on clinical scores, our proposed strategy based on transcriptomic signatures will result in an increasingly accurate prediction and, furthermore, provide insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms leading to MOF after infection. Identification of these molecular mechanisms may ultimately aid in uncovering potential targets for pharmacological interventions. Overall, results from this study may provide the foundation for further studies of infections-related outcome prediction in different blunt trauma cohorts, as well as in cohorts affected by other types of trauma. The methods and findings from this study may also be applicable to other immunocompromised populations, such as cancer patients and post-surgery patients. Severe trauma renders patients immunocompromised and vulnerable to infections that often lead to life- threatening conditions, such as multiple organ failure (MOF). Our study proposes to provide a personalized medicine strategy for rapidly and accurately identifying patients who are at high risk of developing MOF immediately after they experience infection. Early risk profiling will aid clinicians in informed decision-making to improve patient outcomes and may also lead to the development of new preventative methods.",Multi Biomarker-based prediction tool development to determine risk of infections-related outcomes among severe blunt trauma patients,10126230,R03AI151499,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Confidence Intervals ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Foundations ', ' Glues ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Immunosuppression ', ' Immunosuppression Effect ', ' Immunosuppressive Effect ', ' immune suppression ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' Injury Severity Score ', ' ISS Score ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Multiple Organ Failure ', ' MOF syndrome ', ' Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome ', ' multiorgan failure ', ' multiple organ system failure ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Receiver Operating Characteristics ', ' Receiver Operator Characteristics ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Syndrome ', ' Work ', ' Immunocompromised Host ', ' Immunocompromised ', ' Immunocompromised Patient ', ' Immunosuppressed Host ', ' immunosuppressed patient ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Nosocomial Infections ', ' Hospital Infections ', ' Hospital acquired infection ', ' institutional infection ', ' Ensure ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' insight ', ' Measurement ', ' APACHE II ', ' acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Severities ', ' System ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Prevent infection ', ' Infection prevention ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' sterile ', ' Sterility ', ' Glossary ', ' blunt force trauma ', ' Blunt Trauma ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' rapid method ', ' rapid technique ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Detection ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' molecular profile ', ' molecular signature ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' resilience ', ' response to injury ', ' injury response ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' transcriptomics ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' tool development ', ' high risk ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' new drug target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new therapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' clinical practice ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' Trauma patient ', ' prognostic tool ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' biomarker development ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' biomarker panel ', ' marker panel ', ' biomarker discovery ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' Preventive measure ', ' Preventative measure ', ' patient response ', ' patient specific response ', ' responsive patient ', ' infection risk ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' clinical database ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NIAID,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R03,2021,84000,MA-08
"Decoding the microbial burden in diabetic foot ulcers Chronic, non-healing wounds are common and costly complications of diabetes. Microbial colonization and biofilm formation are hypothesized to impair wound healing and contribute to severe complications such as osteomyelitis and amputation. Although all chronic wounds are colonized with microbiota, its importance, in the absence of clinical infection, is currently unknown. In this competitive renewal, we hypothesize that host response, wound healing, and clinical DFU outcomes are determined by 1) genomic diversification of the wound pathogen Staphylococcus aureus; 2) commensal interactions with wound pathogens; and 3) commensal interactions with the host. In the previous cycle, we developed a shotgun metagenomic sequencing pipeline to analyze the microbiota colonizing neuropathic, non-infected DFU (n=100; the “DFU100” cohort) in a longitudinal prospective cohort study. We observed that strain-level variation of the wound pathogen Staphylococcus aureus was associated with DFU outcomes. Therefore, in Aim 1, we will use a microbial genomic approach and matched clinical isolates from the DFU100 cohort to identify S. aureus genomic determinants of pathogenesis in DFU and their association with clinical outcomes. We also observed that species clinically regarded as “bystanders” (e.g. skin commensals, environmental contaminants) influence the virulence of wound pathogens and tune host tissue repair responses to promote healing in vivo. Aim 2 will determine if a skin commensal, Corynebacterium striatum, tunes the virulence of S. aureus and improves wound healing in murine and porcine models of S. aureus wound infection. Aim 3 is based on our observation that Alcaligenes faecalis wound isolates promote keratinocyte migration, cytokine secretion, and accelerated wound closure in a murine model of diabetic wound healing. We will establish the mechanism and therapeutic potential of A. faecalis-mediated host responses that lead to accelerated wound healing. The proposed research will use cutting-edge, cross-disciplinary approaches to investigate interactions between wound pathogens, wound “bystanders”, and the host; understanding these mechanisms will lead to improved DFU outcomes as our long-term objectives are to 1) develop novel microbiota-based interventions to improve healing that exploit microbial interactions with each other and the host; and 2) identify microbial biomarkers to classify patients at risk of complication. Chronic non-healing foot wounds develop in as many as 25% of persons with diabetes, and are often colonized or infected with microbes, though the role of microbes in healing and complications is unclear. The objective of this project is to establish the microbial basis of impaired healing and poor outcomes in diabetic foot ulcers by coupling cutting-edge microbial genomic and bioinformatic techniques with clinically relevant models. This knowledge will enable the development of novel microbiota-based therapeutic approaches and identification of patients at risk for complication.",Decoding the microbial burden in diabetic foot

"A multifactorial pipeline to dissect combinatorial drug efficacy in Tuberculosis ABSTRACT The rapid spread of multi-drug resistance has created a great need for new combination therapies to treat a variety of conditions, including infectious diseases and cancer. In one pressing example, multidrug resistant tuberculosis (TB) affects about 500,000 people each year and novel drug regimens are sorely needed. However, identifying new regimens has been daunting in part due to the inability to prioritize among a very large number of possible drug combinations. To address this need, we have generated an experimentally grounded, machine learning algorithm, INDIGO-MTB, which predicts the synergy or antagonism of TB drug combinations with high accuracy. Here we propose to adapt INDIGO-MTB into a multifactorial pipeline to dissect combinatorial drug efficacy and drive preclinical regimen development for TB. We will build in and validate the ability to predict drug interactions under stressful environmental conditions that mimic TB infection, and extract molecular mechanisms of drug interactions. We will then combine synergy and efficacy measurements to create new regimen rankings, which we will validate both in vitro and in a mouse model of TB infection. Altogether, our work will establish a tool for rapid assessment of TB drug combinations and a framework for applying this approach to other conditions where new multidrug therapies are needed. NARRATIVE Tuberculosis is a massive public health problem, and new drug regimens are sorely needed.

"MS Diagnostic Bacterial Identification Library PROJECT SUMMARY Infectious diseases have a substantial global health impact. Clinicians need rapid and accurate diagnoses of infections to direct patient treatment and improve antibiotic stewardship, but current methodologies face severe limitations in this regard. In the first funding cycle of our MPI grant “GM111066 - MS diagnostic bacterial identification library,” we produced a novel diagnostic platform in which microbial membrane glycolipids analyzed by mass spectrometry represent chemical “fingerprints” that were then used to differentiate Gram- negative and –positive and fungal isolates after mono- or poly-microbial growth in standard laboratory medias or complex biological (urine, blood bottles, and would effluent). In the second funding cycle, we aim to improve the diagnostic as discussed below.  At the start this project, it had not been previously shown that bacterial or fungal membrane lipids could provide a unique chemical signature or barcode that could be used for reliable pathogen identification. The fact that these lipids (Gram-: LPS/lipid A, Gram+: Lipoteichoic acid/cardiolipin, Fungi: glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, and sterols) are present in high abundance (~106 copies per cell) makes them easily extractable with a single rapid LPS-based protocol (less than 60 minutes from sample to MS identification). Importantly, for clinical use, we successfully used our platform to solve these four major unmet needs from the protein-based phenotyping approach: 1) removed the need for growth prior to MS analysis, 2) identification of bacterial and fungal isolates with a single extraction protocol, 3) identification directly from complex biological fluids, including urine, BAL fluid, wound effluent, and blood bottles, and 4) antimicrobial resistant strains could be distinguished from the related susceptible strain. Finally, based on our thirteen peer-reviewed publications from the first funding period and extensive preliminary data, we believe we have proven our highly innovative original hypothesis and even advanced it past the original aims by using a design of experiment (DOE) process to allow identification in under an hour direct from specimen.  In the second funding cycle, we propose to further innovate by i) using DOE to improve limit of detection (LOD) from 106 to 103 which is the threshold for urinary tract infections; ii) extend the assay to direct analysis of urine and stool samples without culture; iii) develop machine learning approaches to improve identification of individual bacteria from polymicrobial infections; iv) expand detection of antimicrobial resistance beyond colistin; v) develop a method for identification and structure analysis of lipids isolated from 100-1000 cells; and vi) vastly expand our ability to identify pathogenic fungi, which are a growing healthcare issue, and Gram- positive organisms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Failure to identify bacterial and fungal infections rapidly places an enormous financial burden on the U.S. health system totaling billions annually with complications from minor events extending hospital stays to death from sepsis. We have developed a lipid-based MS method for bacterial and fungal identification that can be carried out in under an hour direct from specimen. Here, we will further develop this method for use in the study of complex biological fluids, including stool, urine, and blood bottles without culture. Specifically, we will improve the limit of detection in order to distinguish microbial load at or below 103 CFU/ml ! !",MS Diagnostic Bacterial Identification Library,10116273,R01AI147314,"['Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Bacteria ', ' Bacterial Infections ', ' bacteria infection ', ' bacterial disease ', ' Bacterial Proteins ', ' Bacterial Gene Products ', ' Bacterial Gene Proteins ', ' Bar Codes ', ' barcode ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cardiolipins ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' cell culture ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Colistin ', ' Colimycin ', ' Colisticin ', ' Polymyxin E ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Escherichia coli ', ' E coli ', ' E. coli ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Feces ', ' stool ', ' fungus ', ' Glycolipids ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' care facilities ', ' General Hospitals ', ' Infection ', ' Ions ', ' Laboratories ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Libraries ', ' Lipid A ', ' Lipids ', ' Membrane Lipids ', ' Cell Membrane Lipids ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Minor ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Mycoses ', ' Fungus Diseases ', ' fungal infection ', ' fungus infection ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Phenotype ', ' Proteins ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Sphingolipids ', ' Sterols ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Urinary tract infection ', ' Urinary tract infectious disease ', ' urinary infection ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Work ', ' lipoteichoic acid ', ' lipo-teichoic acid ', ' Intensive Care ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Glycerophospholipids ', ' Phosphoglycerides ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Chemicals ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' tool ', ' Rivers ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' chemical fingerprinting ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' rapid diagnosis ', ' tandem mass spectrometry ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' microbial ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' ward ', ' Clinical Microbiology ', ' biodefense ', ' Address ', ' global health ', ' Health system ', ' Antimicrobial resistant ', ' Resistance to antimicrobial ', ' anti-microbial resistance ', ' anti-microbial resistant ', ' resistance to anti-microbial ', ' resistant to anti-microbial ', ' resistant to antimicrobial ', ' Antimicrobial Resistance ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry ', ' Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight MS ', ' Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' point of care ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Sepsis ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' wound ', ' tissue wound ', ' wounding ', ' wounds ', ' pathogen ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' antimicrobial ', ' anti-microbial ', ' Microbe ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' chemotherapy ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' combat ', ' resistant strain ', ' resistance strain ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' stool sample ', ' stool specimen ', ' pathogenic fungus ', ' fungal pathogen ', ' fungi pathogen ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' financial burden ', ' financial distress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial stress ', ' feature extraction ', ' diagnostic platform ', ' diagnostic system ', ' detection limit ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2021,463500,MD-07
"Developing Computational Methods for Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistant Agents PROJECT ABSTRACT  Antimicrobial resistance is a critical public health issue. Infections with drug resistant pathogens are estimated to cause an additional eight million hospitalization days annually over the hospitalizations that would be seen for infections with susceptible agents. The use of antibiotics (in both clinical and agricultural settings) is being viewed as precursor for these infections and thus, is a major public health concern—particularly as outbreaks become more frequent and severe. However, scientiﬁc evidence describing the hazards associated with antibiotic use is lacking due to inability to quantify the risk of these practices. One promising avenue to elucidate this risk is to use shotgun metagenomics to identify the AMR genes in samples taken through systematic spatiotemporal surveillance. The goal of this proposed work is to develop algorithms that will provide such a means for analysis. The algorithms need to be scalable to very large datasets and thus, will require the development and use succinct data structures.  In order to achieve this goal, the investigative team will develop the theoretical foundations and applied meth- ods needed to study AMR through the use of shotgun metagenomics. A major focus of the proposed work is developing algorithms that can handle very large datasets. To achieve this scalability, we will create novel means to create, compress, reconstruct and update very large de Bruijn graphs that metagenomics data in a manner needed to study AMR. In addition, we will pioneer the study of AMR through long read data by proposing new algorithmic problems and solutions that use data. For example, identifying the location of speciﬁc genes in a metagenomics sample using long read data has not been proposed or studied. Thus, the algorithmic ideas and techniques developed in this project will not only advance the study of AMR, but contribute to the growing domain of big data analysis and pan-genomics.  Lastly, we plan to apply our methods to samples collected from both agricultural and clinical settings in Florida. Analysis of preliminary and new data will allow us to conclude about (1) the public risk associated with antimicro- bial use in agriculture; (2) the effectiveness of interventions used to reduce resistant bacteria, and lastly, (3) the factors that allow resistant bacteria to grow, thrive and evolve. A–1 PROJECT NARRATIVE  Antibiotic use in agriculture is a major public health concern that is receiving a lot of media attention, par- ticularly as antibiotic-resistant infections in become more frequent and severe. This research will build a novel bioinformatics framework for determining how antimicrobial resistant genes evolve, grow, and persist in a system that has been affected by antibiotic use. This will, in turn, facilitate the development of effective intervention methods that reduce resistant pathogens in clinical and agricultural settings.

"T4SS effectors and tick tropism in Anaplasma phagocytolium Project Summary  Tick-borne diseases are on the increase, and are responsible for nearly all of the vector-transmitted disease in the US. Vector-borne pathogens face the dual challenge of adaptation to two very different host environments: the arthropod vector and the mammalian host. To survive within eukaryotic cells, the rickettsial pathogen Anaplasma phagocytophilum blocks phago-lysosome maturation, inhibits apoptosis, modulates host gene expression, redirects trans-Golgi trafficking, and repurposes autophagic machinery to build a replication vacuole. A. phagocytophilum must accomplish this, all while evading the unique innate immune defenses of mammalian and arthropod host cells. All pathogens in the order Rickettsiales utilize a specialized Type IV Secretion System (T4SS) to deliver effector molecules into the host cell cytosol to mediate host pathogen interactions. However, identification of the secreted effectors has been limited by the obligate nature of these pathogens. Even less is known about how effectors contribute to rickettsial growth in tick cells, as the tick vector remains an understudied niche of these pathogens. To overcome this, our group has developed a T4SS effector prediction program Optimal-features Predictor for T4SS Effectors (OPT4e). When applied to A. phagocytophilum, OPT4e identified 48 putative T4SS effectors. Transcriptomics finds that 15 of these predicted effector genes are specifically expressed during growth within either tick or mammalian cells. We have demonstrated that one of these tick- specific effector candidates, Aph1383, is translocated in a T4 specific manner by the Legionella pneumophila T4SS. Aph1383 also belongs to a paralogous family of six proteins encoded by the gene cluster aph1380-1386. This entire cluster is expressed 2.5-fold more highly during A. phagocytophilum growth in tick cells than during mammalian cell infections. We hypothesize that this family of Aph1383 paralogs are all T4SS effectors which target host cell processes specifically important for A. phagocytophilum growth within tick cells. In this study, we will first use transposon insertion mutants in the aph1380-1386 gene cluster to test the fitness contribution of these genes during A. phagocytophilum growth within tick cells. Next, we will evaluate the T4SS translocation of all Aph1383 paralogs and identify the amino acid sequences necessary for secretion. Finally, we will identify the subcellular localization and molecular targets of Aph1383 within tick cells. Characterizing these molecular interactions of A. phagocytophilum within the tick cell will open the door to development of vector targeted interventions to reduce transmissibility of the pathogen. Project Narrative Vector-borne diseases account for >17% of the global burden of all infectious diseases. The ability of the tick-borne rickettsial pathogen Anaplasma phagocytophilum to manipulate the cell biology of both mammalian and tick cells is achieved through delivery of effector molecules by a specialized secretion system. This project investigates how a family of tick specific effectors enables A. phagocytophilum to survive and replicate within tick cells.",T4SS effectors and tick tropism in Anaplasma phagocytolium,10174737,R21AI154023,"['Amino Acid Sequence ', ' Primary Protein Structure ', ' protein sequence ', ' Anaplasma ', ' Arthropod Vectors ', ' Arthropods ', ' Arthropoda ', ' Bacteria ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' cell culture ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Climate ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Cytosol ', ' Environment ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Eukaryotic Cell ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Family ', ' Gene Cluster ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Golgi Apparatus ', ' Golgi ', ' Golgi Complex ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Infection ', ' Legionella pneumophila ', ' L pneumophila ', ' L. pneumophila ', ' Libraries ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' neutrophil ', ' Blood Neutrophil ', ' Blood Polymorphonuclear Neutrophil ', ' Marrow Neutrophil ', ' Neutrophilic Granulocyte ', ' Neutrophilic Leukocyte ', ' Polymorphonuclear Cell ', ' Polymorphonuclear Leukocytes ', ' Polymorphonuclear Neutrophils ', ' Parasites ', ' Phagolysosome ', ' Proteins ', ' Rickettsia ', ' Rickettsiales ', ' Salivary Glands ', ' Salivary Glands Head and Neck ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Ticks ', ' Ixodida ', ' Transfection ', ' United States ', ' Vacuole ', ' Mutagenesis ', ' Genetics-Mutagenesis ', ' Mutagenesis Molecular Biology ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Mediating ', ' Apoptosis ', ' Apoptosis Pathway ', ' Programmed Cell Death ', ' Tick-Borne Diseases ', ' tick-borne illness ', ' tickborne disease ', ' tickborne illness ', ' Biochemical ', ' Midgut ', ' Tropism ', ' A phagocytophila ', ' A phagocytophilum ', ' A. phagocytophila ', ' A. phagocytophilum ', ' Anaplasma phagocytophila ', ' Cytoecetes phagocytophila ', ' Ehrlichia equi ', ' Ehrlichia phagocytophila ', ' HGE Agent ', ' Anaplasma phagocytophilum ', ' Reporter ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' programs ', ' cell biology ', ' Cellular biology ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Dependence ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' mutant ', ' trafficking ', ' Human Cell Line ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' peptide aminoacid sequence ', ' peptide sequence ', ' protein aminoacid sequence ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Protein Family ', ' Defect ', ' Ectopic Expression ', ' Mammalian Cell ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Type IV Secretion System Pathway ', ' T4SS ', ' Type IV Secretion System ', ' type 4 secretion system ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Vector-transmitted infectious disease ', ' Vector-borne disease ', ' Vector-borne infectious disease ', ' Vector-transmitted disease ', ' vector-borne illness ', ' vectorborne disease ', ' vectorborne illness ', ' vectorborne infectious disease ', ' paralogous gene ', ' paralog ', ' vector ', ' feeding ', ' pathogen ', ' pathogenic bacteria ', ' bacteria pathogen ', ' bacterial pathogen ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' transcriptomics ', ' fitness test ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' vector tick ', ' tick-borne ', ' tickborne ', ' vector-borne pathogen ', ' vectorborne pathogen ', ' ']",NIAID,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,229500,WA-05
"Macrophage Polarization in Response to Infections and Inflammation Abstract Macrophages in Greek means “big eaters"" are powerful cellular components of innate immunity. They play a pivotal role in immune defense by ‘eating’ pathogens, dead or cancerous cells. They also contribute to tissue homeostasis, development and repair. When doing their job, macrophages react to their surroundings and trigger acute inflammation to resolve the problems. They do so by assuming one of the two states that have been widely recognized, i.e., immunoreactive (proinflammatory) and immunotolerant (a.k.a, M1 and M2, respectively). While finite degrees of reactivity and tolerance are desirable in physiology, excess of either state is undesirable and invariably associated with disease pathogenesis (i.e., the Goldilocks conundrum). For example, hyperreactivity is recognized as the root cause of tissue injury in a wide array of diseases (colitis, sepsis, NASH) and hypertolerance is a common determinant that drives most, if not all chronic diseases that are incurable, e.g., cancers. Consensus on the definition of these physiologic and pathologic macrophage states has not been reached, perhaps because of 4 major challenges: heterogeneity, biological robustness, the temporal evolution of the network, and artifacts (tremendous plasticity of macrophages as they drift rapidly when isolated from tissues). We have used a novel computational methodology, Boolean Implication Network [Sahoo 2008], to analyze pooled human macrophage gene expression datasets. This method, which identifies asymmetric gene expression patterns, blurs noise (heterogeneity/artifacts) but reveals a temporal model of events that is invariably seen across all datasets. The analysis revealed hitherto unknown continuum transition states between reactive to tolerant states along five paths; machine-learning identified one of them as the major path which subsequently stood the rigorous test/validation on multiple publicly available transcriptomic datasets, across species (mouse and human), macrophage subtypes and disease states. Most importantly, unlike other commonly used gene cluster signatures, the Boolean path can prognosticate outcomes across diverse diseases. Preliminary validation studies on a genetic model confirm that the path could be exploited for modulating macrophage polarization by altering LPS/TLR4 responses. We will now interrogate the impact of these discoveries using an iterative approach, i.e., model-driven experimentation and experiment-driven model refinement, through three aims: Unravel the importance of novel molecular drivers in the newly identified gene signatures of macrophage polarization using semi-HTP chemical/genetic screens on murine and human monocyte-derived macrophages (Aim 1), in murine disease models of hyperreactivity and hypertolerance (Aim 2) and in “Humanoids”, i.e., human organoid-based microbe/immune cells co-culture models (“gut-in-a-dish”; Aim 3). Although our focus is gastrointestinal infection and inflammation, the findings will define macrophage transition states in multiple organs/disease contexts and therefore, impact many fields. We expect to identify high-value therapeutic targets that can restrict and/or reset macrophage responses to infections and inflammation within the “Goldilocks zone.” Narrative Macrophages are powerful cellular components of innate immunity; on the one hand they play a pivotal role in defending against pathogens, cancerous cells and other harmful stimuli by being immunoreactive, and on the other hand, they contribute to tissue homeostasis by being immunotolerant to harmless antigens and beneficial microbes. Too much or too little of either of these two states (immunoreactive vs. tolerant) can serve as triggers and perpetuate diverse human diseases. Using novel computational approaches, we have charted a formal model for macrophage response to infections, and revealed hitherto unknown important genes that regulate the process of macrophage polarization; we plan to identify potential therapeutic targets that can reprogram macrophage response in disease states.",Macrophage Polarization in Response to Infections and

"NeoChip for specific and rapid identification of congenital CMV and neonatal HSV infections on minimal sample volume Project Summary  Congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) and neonatal herpes simplex virus (nHSV) impose major health threats on neonates. Although CMV and HSV are lifelong infections with periods of latency and reactivation, most maternal infections remain undiagnosed due to nonspecific or absent clinical symptoms. In the United States, a child is permanently disabled by cCMV infection every hour, even though 9 of 10 infants are asymptomatic after birth and remain undiagnosed. Invasive nHSV, on the other hand, is a rare neonatal infection that presents with a broad range of clinical symptoms, including those that may be life-threatening. Viral culture and DNA detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have become the “Gold Standard” for the diagnosis of cCMV and nHSV infection, despite poor sensitivity of PCR assays in neonates and time consuming culture techniques (up to 5-7 days).  Universal genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (U-HRM) provides a simple, low cost, rapid, and modern alternative to viral cultures and PCR techniques. By measuring the fluorescence of an intercalating dye as PCR-amplified pathogen DNA or RNA fragments are heated and disassociate, sequence defined melt curves, or “fingerprints”, are generated with single-nucleotide resolution in a closed-tube reaction. These unique microbial “fingerprints” are then automatically identified and quantified using machine learning technology, with an accuracy of 99-100% on minimal blood volume (1 mL), in a platform called NeoChip. Presently, we have established unique signature melt curves for 40 bacterial species and antimicrobial resistance genes that commonly infect neonates. Additionally, NeoChip has been expanded to distinguish individually amplified melt curve signatures for multiple pathogen identification and quantification, as required for polymicrobial infection.  In this proposal, we will build out NeoChip’s comprehensive database by incorporating clinical strains of CMV and HSV with actionable antiviral resistance genes. Because NeoChip identifies variances in nucleic acid sequences, individual differentiation and quantification of CMV and HSV strains are possible. We will also translate the NeoChip for specific and rapid diagnosis of cCMV and nHSV infection in a large prospective clinical study of pregnant women and their offspring(s), as well as directly compare the platform to standard quantitative nucleic acid test (QNAT) assays, IgG/IgM antibody testing, and clinical outcome measures for statistical concordance (predictive value). Finally, we will validate and translate NeoChip for cCMV detection and clinical correlation using dried blood spot (DBS) samples for incorporation into standard universal newborn screening programs. NeoChip’s goal is to provide an accurate and valid test for the timely diagnosis of pathogen etiology (viral, bacterial, and fungal) in a single test with efficacy on broad tissue matrices and capacity to inform microbial resistance, thereby facilitating early administration of targeted antimicrobials and therapeutics. This proposal directly addresses the funding call by applying a multidisciplinary approach to address the biomedical challenges of rapidly and accurately diagnosing cCMV and nHSV to facilitate disease prognostication and early therapeutic or intervention programs. Project Narrative NeoChip combines real-time PCR, digital High Resolution Melting (dHRM) of DNA and RNA, and machine learning to create unique “fingerprints"" for microbes and antimicrobial resistance, allowing for faster and more precise detection of pathogen(s) causing neonatal infection. This project will build out NeoChip’s melt curve database to include clinically relevant strains of cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus infections, while concordantly assembling updated epidemiologic timelines and prevalence of perinatal CMV and HSV transmission. Our goals are to validate NeoChip for the rapid and specific diagnosis of congenital CMV and neonatal HSV infection on multiple tissue matrices and translate the NeoChip platform for incorporation

"Investigating bacterial contributions to TB treatment response: a focus on in-host pathogen dynamics Project Summary/Abstract Rapid and accurate methods to monitor tuberculosis (TB) treatment response do not currently exist. Efforts to improve outcomes have focused on early identification of rifampicin susceptibility followed by prompt treatment initiation and adherence monitoring. The rapid molecular susceptibility tests most often used give dichotomous cutoffs. Recent studies though show that minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) just below these breakpoints also predict poor outcomes. Even if a patient takes most of their therapy, clinical response can still vary substantially. Delays in sputum clearance (culture conversion from growth to no growth) can range from a few days to 5 months and failure or relapse rates can be as high as 20% in drug-susceptible TB. During the weeks to months of human infection and antibiotic treatment, in host Mtb populations experience substantial measurable genetic changes. These changes may be neutral or allow pathogen adaption to immune, antibiotic or metabolic pressure, e.g. low iron or cobalamin levels that may result in heritable drug tolerance and resistance phenotypes. Here we propose to study in host longitudinal pathogen dynamics including changes in population diversity over time and identify genes under selection to shed light on host-pathogen interactions. The study of in host pathogen dynamics can improve our understanding of cure from infection and pave the way for the use of whole genome sequencing for monitoring treatment response, circumventing the delays and biohazards of traditional culture-based approaches. We additionally propose the development of a genome- based predictor of MIC and to assess if MIC predictions are associated with delays in culture conversion and poor clinical response. We will systematically study pathogen samples from a well characterized TB treatment patient cohort (NIAID TRUST TB cohort in Worcester, South Africa -PI Dr. Jacobson) combining long and deep short-read sequencing to resolve full genome assemblies and variants at low allele frequency. We have strong preliminary data that long-read sequencing unmasks more Mtb genetic diversity than detectable by short-read sequencing alone and have previously characterized directional selection in a subset of genes including resistance loci, the B12 biosynthesis pathway, and PPE genes known to interact with host innate defense. The proposed work is enabled by our methodological expertise in population genetics, machine learning and resistance prediction for clonal bacteria like Mtb and will allow, for the first time, the study of directional and diversifying selection on the full repertoire of Mtb genetic variation. It will also allow the training of an MIC prediction model on a large ~17,000 isolate dataset curated across studies and geographies. Both study aims promise to inform our understanding of how pathogen genetic variation affects Mtb survival in host and the response to treatment. Project Narrative Patients with tuberculosis (TB) can benefit greatly if we could identify signs of poor response earlier and adjust therapy intensity accordingly. Innovations in DNA isolation and sequencing technologies now enable the study of TB pathogen populations in an individual patient with very high resolution. Here, we propose to use these technologies and a highly well-characterized cohort of South African TB patients to investigate how pathogen population genetic changes link to pathogen survival and treatment response, laying the foundation for improvements in clinical treatment monitoring using DNA sequencing.",Investigating bacterial contributions to TB treatment response: a focus on in-host

"Metabolic Basis of Bacterial Community Function in the Cystic Fibrosis Airway Abstract. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a fatal genetic disease characterized by overproduction of mucus in the lungs followed by chronic lung infections. Conventional wisdom has been that most CF lung infections involve a single dominant organism, most commonly the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Advances in culture-independent techniques have revealed that CF lung infections are rarely mono-microbial and instead usually involve complex microbial communities, yet the interspecies interactions that drive these communities are poorly understood. Furthermore, numerous studies have demonstrated that polymicrobial infections are more difficult than mono-microbial infections to eradicate with antibiotics, leading to the concept of recalcitrant communities. The mechanisms underlying recalcitrance are thought to involve synergistic interactions between community members, but very little data are available to understand this phenomenon. Combined with the realization that many CF patients respond poorly to available antibiotic regimens compels a more detailed understanding of interspecies interactions and their impacts on antibiotic recalcitrance to improve the treatment of CF infections, as well as other polymicrobial diseases. Here, we combine big-data bioinformatics, in silico computational modeling and in vitro culture experiments to gain insights into the metabolic interactions that drive CF disease outcomes and antibiotic recalcitrance. The research will leverage an available data set of hundreds of CF patient samples that provide both bacterial composition data and clinical metadata, including measures of lung function. These samples will be clustered according to their measured compositions and metabolic capabilities predicted through computational metabolic modeling to test the hypothesis that the vast complexity of these many bacterial communities can be collapsed into a small number of model communities that capture most of the observed metabolic variability. These computational predictions will be tested by developing in vitro cell culture models that recapitulate the most important metabolic features of the in vivo polymicrobial communities (Aim 1). By applying bioinformatics and modeling to the same clinical data, we will test the hypothesis that community metabolic features drive disease outcomes and the virulence potential of these communities (Aim 2). Finally, we will interrogate the clinical data and in vitro communities to test the hypothesis that community metabolic features drive antibiotic recalcitrance and differentiate community responsiveness to antibiotics according to these metabolic features (Aim 3). Our research will yield novel insights into how complex polymicrobial communities are compositionally structured, interact metabolically, contribute to disease and respond to antibiotics. Moreover, the research will validate in vitro models that offer the potential for development of novel antimicrobial strategies to better treat chronic, polymicrobial infections in CF and other diseases. Our transdisciplinary team offers the necessary expertise in bioinformatics, computational modeling, microbial physiology and CF polymicrobial infections to tackle this complex problem. Project Narrative: Infections associated with cystic fibrosis, and other polymicrobial infections, are still a significant cause of morbidity and mortality.

"A computational modeling framework for COVID-19 vaccination Project Summary/Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), remains a global pandemic at present. Quantitative research is urgently needed to clarify the impacts of the current vaccination campaign on the pandemic evolution and economic growth, and to guide future policy development. The overall objective of this proposal is to establish a new computational modeling framework for an investigation of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign in the US, and to incorporate real data to assess the impacts of COVID-19 vaccination on public health and the economy. To achieve this objective, the team will pursue three specific aims: (1) Modeling the transmission and spread of COVID-19 under the impact of vaccination; (2) Modeling the economic impact of COVID-19 vaccination; (3) Conducting a case study for the Chattanooga region in the state of Tennessee. The proposed research is significant because it will incorporate detailed characteristics and potential limitations of the current vaccination campaign (such as the vaccine efficacy, phased allocation schemes, public resistance to vaccination, and vaccine breakthrough due to new variants of SARS- CoV-2) into a sophisticated modeling framework, which will enable us to make more accurate forecasts on the progression and long-term evolution of the pandemic. As such, the project is expected to advance the current understanding of COVID-19 transmission and to quantify the interaction between epidemic spreading, economic growth, and disease prevention and intervention under the impact of COVID-19 vaccination, all of which are important for the control and management of the pandemic. The approach is innovative in the development of a computational framework that integrates novel mechanistic and machine learning models and that connects the epidemic and economic aspects of COVID-19. The innovation of this project is also reflected by the integration of sophisticated computational modeling, rigorous mathematical analysis, intensive numerical simulation, and detailed data validation. The project represents an interdisciplinary collaboration among an applied and computational mathematician with long-term interest in infectious disease modeling (Wang), an epidemiologist with extensive working experiences at CDC and a current member of the regional COVID-19 task force (Heath), a business and management professor with a background in public heath (Mullen), and a statistician with expertise in machine learning and biomedical data analytics (Ma). The success of this project will not only build a solid knowledge base for the complex transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and the health and economic impacts of COVID-19 vaccination, but also provide important guidelines for the government agencies and public health administrations in pandemic management and policy development. Project Narrative The proposed project is relevant to public health because a deep understanding of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign and its health and economic impacts will help to inform the pandemic management and improve the current practice in disease prevention and intervention. The mathematical and machine learning models developed in this project will improve such understanding and make new knowledge discovery.

"Intelligently predicting viral spillover risks from bats and other wild mammals PROJECT SUMMARY The transmission or ‘spillover’ of wildlife viruses to humans is a critical threat to global health, with outbreaks of viral pathogens like filoviruses, paramyxoviruses, and coronaviruses all originating in wild mammals. A key outstanding question is whether specific taxonomic groups, such as bats, warrant extra surveillance as ‘special reservoirs’ of viruses that are potentially pathogenic to humans. However, existing host-virus datasets are not sufficiently resolved to predict fine-grain risk for species or genera. An effective response must therefore address two core aims: (i) synthesizing knowledge regarding virus-to-mammal interactions; and (ii) using that knowledgebase to robustly predict future spillover events (i.e., zoonotic risk). To enable robust analysis and reusability of public datasets of NIAID’s Bioinformatics Resource Center (BRC; especially NCBI Virus and Virus Pathogen Resources, ViPR), the project will develop Host-Virus Data Intelligence to address three main problems for data reuse: confidence of the taxonomic assignments of mammals and viruses in observations; confidence in the evidence for proposed mammal-virus interactions; and connecting all the relevant data in published texts that are hidden from existing databases. The project team will construct a novel bioinformatic pipeline that will digitally connect taxonomic knowledge, use it to search dark data to find evidence of potential host-virus interactions, and then link it together using metadata layers (‘data about the data’) to form a more expansive host-virus knowledge graph than previously feasible. The project’s computational approach leverages information extraction methods in natural language processing as well as novel applications of artificial intelligence methods such as probabilistic inductive logic programming. A key anticipated outcome is to expand the dataset of host-virus interactions by 3-fold compared to comprehensive existing datasets. The proposed project will lay the foundation for a new generation of work reusing host-virus interaction data to test previously inaccessible hypotheses about how species’ traits impact viral spillover to humans. Shifting the paradigm to graph-based analyses, compared to purely taxonomic representations of host-virus interactions, will allow researchers to directly investigate the impact of ecosystem structure and human encroachment upon viral loads. Determining whether all mammals have equal risk of viral spillover, or whether some groups have higher taxon-specific zoonotic risk (e.g., horseshoe bats, murid rodents), is critical information for public health workers and epidemiologists. More definitive risk quantification will also help researchers identify which ecophysiological adaptations predispose certain groups to tolerating more viruses, which may in turn lead to clinical treatments by modeling the immune responses of wild mammals. Filling the identified gaps in host-virus knowledge is therefore essential to aid the progress of zoonotic disease research in the wake of COVID-19. PROJECT NARRATIVE Synthesizing scientific data about mammal-to-virus interactions is essential to predicting the risk of future events like the COVID-19 pandemic. The project overcomes major obstacles to full and accurate reuse of existing mammal-virus data by applying computational methods for unifying relevant but disconnected data from published sources. Anticipated results will triple available knowledge, opening the door for asking whether some mammals carry more viruses than others and why with unprecedented levels of precision.",Intelligently

"CellGraph: bioimaging software to rapidly identify bacterial genes responsible for modifications to host cell organelle morphology Abstract  Tuberculosis (TB) has been a transmissible human disease for many thousands of years, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is again the number one cause of death due to a single infectious agent. The intense 6- to 10-month process of multi-drug treatment, combined with the adverse side effects that can run the spectrum are major obstacles to patient compliance and therapy completion. The consequent increase in multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extensively drug resistant TB (XDR-TB) cases requires that we increase our arsenal of effective drugs and calls for the development of novel therapeutic approaches. Over the millennia, host and pathogen have evolved mechanisms and relationships that greatly influence the outcome of infection. Understanding these evolutionary interactions and their impact on pathogen clearance or host pathology will lead the way towards rational development of new therapeutics that favor a host protective response. These host-directed therapies have recently demonstrated promising results against Mtb, enhancing the cumulative effects of currently available anti-mycobacterial drugs or directly decreasing bacterial replication. However, our understanding of the host cell-pathogen interactions that lead to increased bacterial growth or host immune evasion is limited, and thus the ability to identify targets for novel host-directed drugs is hampered by a lack of mechanistic knowledge. Current methods for identifying Mtb virulence factors and imaging host cellular effects are slow and laborious with a general inability to simultaneously link multiple factors.  Through the use of a high-throughput, large-scale computational pipeline, we can rapidly and effectively detect changes in the organellar morphology of host cells during infection with pathogens. Mycobacterium marinum, a biosafety level 2 bacterium, causes tuberculosis-like pathology in fish and amphibians and is used as a Mtb surrogate to study aspects of the infection process. The framework, CellGraph, will quantify changes in organellar shape, quantity, and spatial distribution over large sequences of Z-stack microscope images and digital videos, improving our understanding of cellular mechanisms as they respond to their environments. Any tagged subcellular component can be tracked within our system. This framework takes the novel approach of examining subcellular components as nodes in a social network. Characterizing ensembles of cellular machinery, such as tagged mitochondria in this study, as social networks allows our framework to study organellar evolution as a function of interconnectedness of cellular components. In addition to quantifying global information such as quantity and appearance, our framework's approach can also provide more detailed local feedback regarding how subsets of the organellar ensembles evolve. Mycobacterium marinum homologs of six of the Mtb genes predicted to impact host mitochondrial morphology, including rv3875 (encoding ESAT-6), will be deleted and assessed for mitochondrial morphology phenotypes. CellGraph will form the foundation for future high-throughput computational pipelines, enable rapid quantitative analysis of organellar temporal evolution for extremely large data, provide detailed results at high statistical resolutions, and be released as open source software that is available to the entire scientific community for additional applications and for validation. Project Narrative Current methods for identifying bacterial, in this case Mycobacterium tuberculosis, virulence factors and imaging host cellular effects are slow and laborious with a general inability to simultaneously link multiple factors. Through the development of the CellGraph toolbox, we aim to address several problems in bioimaging; in particular, the novel contributions from CellGraph include modeling social network behavior of organelles and performing this analysis at scale. The framework in this study will be used to characterize the spatio-temporal evolution of mitochondrial networks in cells infected with M. tuberculosis.",CellGraph: bioimaging software to rapidly

"Clinical Development and Evaluation of a Deep Learning Approach to Improve Diagnostic Accuracy PROJECT SUMMARY Introduction: PhotoniCare, Inc. is a medical device company developing the TOMi Scope, a handheld, optical imaging device for improved diagnosis of middle ear health. The purpose of this proposal is to establish and evaluate a machine learning approach to facilitate both: (1) ease and reliability of quality data capture in a pediatric population from users with a range of otscopy expertise, and; (2) assist interpretation of the TOMi Scope’s correlated otoscopy and depth-resolved images in order to enable improved diagnostic accuracy and, ultimately, effective management. Significance: Ear infections affect 93% of all children, yet they are one of the most poorly diagnosed (~50% accuracy) and managed diseases in all of medicine, resulting in high antimicrobial over-prescription and resistance development. Correctly identifying the absence or presence/type of middle ear effusion (MEE; fluid) through the non-transparent eardrum is critical to accurate diagnosis, and the limited current diagnostic tools suffer poor diagnostic adoption (7-38% reported use) and accuracy (50-70%) due to inherent subjectivity and dependence on user expertise. Therefore, there is a clear and unmet need for superior, objective screening, starting with a definitive yet easily and reliably usable diagnostic tool for this extremely prevalent yet poorly managed disease. Hypothesis: Applying a machine learning approach to TOMi Scope imaging guidance and diagnostic classification will facilitate both: 1) ease-of-use and reliable quality data collection improvement, and 2) accurate detection of the presence or absence of MEE, as well as classification of the type of infection, regardless of user experience. Specific Aims: (1) Collect labeled TOMi Scope data (otoscopy and depth-scan images) from 268 patients at pediatric offices affiliated with UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh, (2) Achieve reliable usability of the TOMi Scope by guiding image capture using TOMi-net, a deep learning model, (3) Develop a multimodal deep learning model to provide diagnostic assistance using TOMi Scope otoscopy and depth-scan data. Commercial Opportunity: The TOMi Scope will provide physicians with a superior user experience and new, objective information, enabling better decision-making for antibiotic prescription and surgical intervention. This has the potential to impact the standard of care for ~1B children worldwide that experience ear infections, representing a multi-billion-dollar commercial opportunity. PROJECT NARRATIVE Ear infections (otitis media) are highly prevalent in the pediatric population and represent a significant clinical challenge due to the limitations of the gold-standard diagnostic tools, resulting in high antimicrobial prescription and consequent resistance development. Accurate detection and classification of effusion (fluid) in the middle ear is a critical element for this diagnosis, and for making informed medical treatment decisions, particularly regarding antibiotic stewardship. The long-term goal of this work is to reduce antibiotic resistance and healthcare costs through improving patient outcomes by addressing the low diagnostic accuracy and user experience issues of current subjective methods, with a novel, non-invasive imaging tool capable of quantitative depth-resolved measurements to not only visualize the underlying infection behind the eardrum, but also, with automated machine learning image analysis algorithms, minimize user experience dependence and variability.",Clinical Development and Evaluation of a Deep Learning Approach to Improve Diagnostic

"Determinants of TB control, relapse and reinfection Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), continues to be a severe global health problem. TB is multifaceted, but a central clinical and microbiologic feature of the disease is the ability of Mtb to resist complete elimination, both by the host immune system and by chemotherapeutic agents with potent growth inhibitory activity. This persistence in the face of immunologic and antibiotic pressure underlies several important facets of TB disease, including 1) the existence of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and, in the setting of immunologic failure of LTBI control, its role in the genesis of active TB and 2) the prolonged course of TB antibiotic therapy, which requires 6 months of multidrug therapy to achieve reliable clinical cure. Rather than producing complete bacterial eradication in all treated subjects, cure following TB chemotherapy is now understood to be an antibiotic induced paucibacillary state in which prevention of relapse depends in part on poorly understood host factors. The host and bacterial determinants that mediate these two interrelated types of persistence are only partially understood, a knowledge gap the Tri-I-TBRU aims to fill. We propose a set of 3 intersecting projects and 3 cores all focused on different facets of the problem of paucibacillary TB, both post treatment and LTBI. The projects will use samples and clinical data from TB cohorts at our clinical site at GHESKIO in Port Au Prince Haiti, to examine the immunologic, microbiomic, transcriptomic, pharmacokinetic, and genetic factors that influence or predict the transition points between paucibacillary states of TB disease and active transmissible infection. These human studies will be compared and contrasted with a new mouse model of paucibacillary infection that will allow us to test mechanistic hypotheses about the host and bacterial determinants of paucibacillary disease. This work with be conducted by a team of highly collaborative investigators who have who have worked well together for several years. Tuberculosis is a major global health burden, killing more than 1.5 million people every year, despite the availability of therapy. A central clinical and microbiologic feature of the disease is the ability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) to resist complete elimination, both by the host immune system and by chemotherapeutic agents. This project will investigate the host and bacterial determinants that mediate persistence of Mtb within its human host.","Determinants of TB control, relapse and reinfection",10268801,U19AI162568,"['Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Bacillus ', ' Bacteria ', ' Body Fluids ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Family ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Haiti ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Infection ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' M tb ', ' M tuberculosis ', ' M. tb ', ' M. tuberculosis ', ' mtb ', ' Patients ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' pressure ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Relapse ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Ships ', ' Siblings ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tuberculosis ', ' M tuberculosis infection ', ' M. tb infection ', ' M. tuberculosis infection ', ' M.tb infection ', ' M.tuberculosis infection ', ' MTB infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection ', ' TB infection ', ' disseminated TB ', ' disseminated tuberculosis ', ' infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' tuberculosis infection ', ' tuberculous spondyloarthropathy ', ' Work ', ' Immunophenotyping ', ' Immunologic Subtyping ', ' immunophenotype ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Infection Control ', ' Mediating ', ' Organ ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Clinical ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Integration Host Factors ', ' Host Factor ', ' Host Factor Protein ', ' Genetic ', ' Antibiotic Treatment ', ' bacterial disease treatment ', ' bacterial infectious disease treatment ', ' Antibiotic Therapy ', ' Anti Mycobacterial Agents ', ' antimycobacterial ', ' Antimycobacterial Agents ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Chemotherapy Protocol ', ' Chemotherapy Regimen ', ' Chemotherapy, Cancer, General ', ' Combination Chemotherapy Regimen ', ' Quimioterapia ', ' cancer chemotherapy ', ' Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Country ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' immunopathology ', ' success ', ' synergism ', ' cohort ', ' TYK2 ', ' chemotherapeutic agent ', ' disease recurrence prevention ', ' disorder recurrence prevention ', ' recurrence prevention ', ' relapse prevention ', ' disorder later incidence prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Clinical Microbiology ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' global health ', ' Mouse Strains ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Immunologics ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologically ', ' Process ', ' microbiome ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' clinical research site ', ' clinical site ', ' pathogen ', ' Population ', ' transcriptomics ', ' chemotherapy ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' tuberculosis drugs ', ' Antitubercular Drugs ', ' TB drugs ', ' anti-TB drugs ', ' anti-tuberculosis drugs ', ' antituberculosis drugs ', ' tuberculosis treatment ', ' TB therapy ', ' TB treatment ', ' tuberculosis therapy ', ' high risk ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Sterilization ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' NGS Method ', ' NGS system ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' gut microbiome ', ' GI microbiome ', ' digestive tract microbiome ', ' enteric microbiome ', ' gastrointestinal microbiome ', ' gut-associated microbiome ', ' intestinal biome ', ' intestinal microbiome ', ' relapse risk ', ' high dimensionality ', ' recruit ', ' microbiome research ', ' Microbiomics ', ' microbiome science ', ' microbiome studies ', ' chronic infection ', ' persistent infection ', ' microbiome composition ', ' microbiome community composition ', ' microbiome species composition ', ' tuberculosis chemotherapy ', ' ']",NIAID,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,U19,2021,2755450,NY-12
"A Handheld Microchip for GC analysis of breath to screen for COVID-19 Project Summary  The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented societal suffering and economic disruption. In the United States, more than six million people have contracted COVID-19 and more than one hundred ninety thousand patients have died of this disease to date. Although current COVID-19 diagnostic testing technologies are critical for slowing the spread of the virus and preventing future outbreaks, they are not practical for field use. Current diagnostic tests are cumbersome to perform because they use aqueous solutions, require multiple steps, and hours-to-days to obtain results. Since the US began to reopen the economy in May, there has been a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a diagnostic approach that is non-invasive, portable, and can rapidly provide test results.  The overall goal of the project is to develop a mobile breath analysis technology for rapid screening for COVID-19 using a handheld breath collection tool and a portable GC with a photoionization detector (PID). The handheld tool will be a closed system for trapping select volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on a microfabricated chip. The captured VOCs will be eluted with ethanol and then analyzed using a commercially available, portable GC-PID instrument. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms will be applied to recognize the VOC pattern that correlates with COVID-19 infection. The central innovation is the microfabricated chip that captures carbonyl compounds in exhaled breath and thus serves as a preconcentrator, which enables analysis of carbonyl VOCs by the portable GC-PID. The hypothesis is that the carbonyl metabolome in exhaled breath is directly related to the body’s reaction to the novel coronavirus infection, and changes in the carbonyl VOC composition in exhaled breath relative to healthy controls can be used to detect both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients.  Three specific aims are proposed to fulfill the overall goal. Aim 1 is to build a disposable handheld breath analyzer tool for concentrating carbonyl VOCs. Aim 2 is to identify VOC patterns in the breath of COVID-19 patients by machine learning algorithms. Aim 3 is to integrate portable GC technology with the breath sampling tool for COVID-19 screening guided by an AI system. The University of Louisville is uniquely suited to rapidly transition the microchip technology to field use because of the PI and Co-PI’s experience in breath analysis and translational research, and the project team’s experience in virology, infectious diseases, biostatistics, and artificial intelligence as well as the state-of-the-art facilities that include a MicroNano Technology Center, Biosafety Level 3 Regional Biocontainment Lab, and an NIH-funded REACH program. 8. Project Narrative  This project will develop a mobile breath analysis technology for rapid screening for COVID-19 using a handheld breath collection tool and a portable GC with a photoionization detector (PID). Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms will be used to analyze the detected signals of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath by the portable GC for detection of COVID-19 patients. UofL is uniquely suited to develop this approach because of the PI’s expertise in breath analysis for detection of Tuberculosis and lung cancer and the team’s experience in virology, infectious diseases, biostatistics, and artificial intelligence.",A Handheld Microchip for GC analysis of breath to screen for COVID-19,10266377,U18TR003787,"['Ethanol ', ' Absolute ethanol ', ' ETOH ', ' Ethyl

"Improving Empiric Antimicrobial Therapy for Gram-Negative Infections through a Personalized Smart Antibiogram Project Summary/Abstract Increasing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the most urgent public health threats. In 2019, the Center for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that infections with AMR affect at least 2.8 million people and are associated with at least 35,900 excessive deaths annually in the US. This threat is particularly problematic among Gram-negative rod (GNR) pathogens in which high-rates of resistance to last-line antimicrobials have emerged globally, while our efforts to develop new antimicrobials have stumbled. To decelerate the emergence of AMR among GNR pathogens, it is essential to guide clinicians away from choosing unnecessarily broad-spectrum antimicrobials. An antibiogram, a facility-level summary of antimicrobial susceptibility data, is a common local reference tool which clinicians use when choosing empiric therapy. However, antibiograms have major limitations. First, little is known about how clinicians are currently using them when making empiric therapy decision. Second, antibiogram data is aggregated at the facility-level, and data may be skewed based on the type of practice or geographic area. Lastly, but most importantly, an antibiogram does not consider any patient-level factors. Therefore, there are strong, and pressing needs to understand 1) how an antibiogram is used by the clinician, 2) how much an antibiogram reflects the risk of AMR for individual patients and 3) how we can overcome limitations of antibiogram to optimize empiric therapy and reduce AMR. The overall goal is to create a novel, real-time personalized antibiogram (“Smart Antibiogram”) to overcome current limitations of antibiogram and to optimize clinician choice of empiric therapy for GNRs by providing a “predicted risk of AMR” based on a machine learning model incorporating patient- and facility-level data. This goal will be accomplished through (a) Master of Science in Health Informatics coursework, (b) a Mentorship Advisory Committee, (c) carefully selected conferences and workshops, and (d) a mentored research study. Our specific aims are to (1) Characterize the current use of antibiograms in clinical practice and measure the acceptable risk of resistance when clinicians make empiric therapy decisions for Gram-negative bloodstream infections and urinary tract infections within diverse clinical settings; (2) Assess the accuracy of currently-used antibiograms to predict the risk of resistance for individual patients in a large retrospective microbiology cohort for GNR infections; (3) Develop a machine learning model to predict the individualized risk of AMR for patients infected with GNR pathogens and validate prospectively and externally. This will lead to the future development of a personalized decision support tool (“Smart Antibiogram”). The expected outcomes of this AHRQ K08 Award will be the comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness and limitations of antibiogram, and the informatics toolkits to develop Smart Antibiogram. At the end of this K08 Award, the candidate will be well-prepared to become an independent investigator with expertise in AMR and health informatics, with specific strength in AMR prediction model decision-support system. Project Narrative Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) among Gram-negative rod organisms is one of the most urgent public health threats in the United States and globally. By using series of survey of clinicians, retrospective cohort analyses, and machine learning prediction analytics, this study elucidates the current perceptions for AMR among providers and creates a machine learning model to accurately predict AMR risk at patient-level. The findings from this study will help create a decision-support system to guide clinicians for appropriate empiric therapy to treat infections due to Gram-negative rod organisms and prepare the applicant for a career as an independent infectious diseases health service investigator.",Improving Empiric Antimicrobial Therapy for Gram-Negative Infections through a Personalized Smart Antibiogram,10263255,K08HS027472,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,K08,2021,143830,IA-02
"Improving predictive capacity of models for universal influenza vaccine development The need for improved and more universally protective influenza vaccines is well recognized. Central to efforts towards improvements is the development of animal models more predictive of the human response to immunization and/or infection. Indeed, this need has been highlighted by the NIAID Strategic Plan for a Universal Influenza Vaccine. While animal models may never be able to fully predict the human response, understanding their full strengths and weaknesses and identifying the optimal models for different purposes is a significant public health need and is the scientific premise behind our proposed objectives. These objectives, which are built upon our extensive use of influenza animal models, are to optimize animal modeling of immunologic imprinting, to improve vaccine efficacy testing, and to identify immune correlates of protection and boosting immune responses. Our overall goal is to provide superior preclinical models to support universal influenza vaccine development. We will achieve this goal through three complementary and interrelated specific aims, 1) optimal modeling of human serologic responses to repeat influenza antigen exposure in animal models; 2) improving the quantitative nature of the ferret influenza challenge model; and 3) defining serologic correlates of influenza virus induced clinical symptoms. Our ability to conduct these aims is supported through our participation in, and collaboration with, a recently NIAID-funded human infant cohort, the DIVINCI study. We will mirror the influenza antigen exposures of a selection of these infants in three animal models and compare immunologic data sets to identify which most accurately reflects the human response (Aim 1). This marriage of human and animal data sets and samples offers an innovative way forward and will provide a unique set of differentially primed animals with which to determine immune correlates of novel physiologic parameters of infection and immune responses (Aim 2) using original machine learning algorithms (Aim 3). Current models for influenza vaccine development suffer from poor predictability of the human response. Through an innovative combination of approaches that use data from longitudinal human cohorts, we intend to greatly enhance the reliability and value of these models in universal influenza vaccine testing.",Improving predictive capacity of models for universal influenza vaccine development,10224652,R01AI150745,"['Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' Antiviral Agents ', ' Antiviral Drugs ', ' Antivirals ', ' anti-viral agents ', ' anti-viral drugs ', ' anti-virals ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Ferrets ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hamsters ', ' Cricetinae ', ' Hamsters Mammals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunity ', ' Immunization ', ' Immunologic Sensitization ', ' Immunologic Stimulation ', ' Immunological Sensitization ', ' Immunological Stimulation ', ' Immunostimulation ', ' Infant ', ' Infection ', ' Influenza ', ' Grippe ', ' influenza virus vaccine ', ' Influenza Vaccines ', ' flu vaccine ', ' flu virus vaccine ', ' vaccine against flu ', ' vaccine against influenza ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Marriage ', ' Methods ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Whole Body Plethysmography ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Public Health ', ' Reagent ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Seasons ', ' Family suidae ', ' Pigs ', ' Suidae ', ' Swine ', ' porcine ', ' suid ', ' Telemetry ', ' Telemetries ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Vaccines ', ' Virulence ', ' Virus Replication ', ' viral multiplication ', ' viral replication ', ' virus multiplication ', ' Measures ', ' Cavia ', ' Guinea Pigs ', ' Guinea Pigs Mammals ', ' Lasso ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Natural History ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Serology ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Immunological Models ', ' Immunologic Model ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' System ', ' Upper respiratory tract ', ' human data ', ' Performance ', ' develop a vaccine ', ' development of a vaccine ', ' vaccine formulation ', ' vaccine development ', ' animal data ', ' cohort ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' novel ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' evaluate vaccines ', ' vaccine screening ', ' vaccine testing ', ' vaccine evaluation ', ' Influenza Virus ', ' influenzavirus ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' NIAID ', ' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease ', ' Preclinical Models ', ' Pre-Clinical Model ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Vaccinated ', ' Vaccine Production ', ' produce vaccines ', ' Immunologics ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologically ', ' Monitor ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype ', ' H3N2 ', ' H3N2 Virus ', ' safety study ', ' Output ', ' vaccine efficacy ', ' vaccine effectiveness ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' imprint ', ' multitask ', ' multi-task ', ' mouse development ', ' preclinical evaluation ', ' pre-clinical evaluation ', ' product development ', ' vaccine candidate ', ' efficacy testing ', ' animal model development ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' universal influenza vaccine ', ' universal flu vaccine ', ' universal influenza virus vaccine ', ' universal vaccine against flu ', ' universal vaccine against influenza ', ' universal vaccine ', ' human model ', ' model of human ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' porcine model ', ' pig model ', ' piglet model ', ' swine model ', ' ']",NIAID,ST.

"Center for Translational Research in Health Disparities Abstract: Diversity in the rates of progression and mortality of COVID-19 disease within infected African American (AAs) subgroups are clearly not just a function of the underlying health conditions that increase the rate of mortality for COVID -19 patients, such as hypertension, obesity and diabetes, but may also be affected by host genetic factors. Here we propose a series of studies to advance the understanding of our knowledge in relative to the health inequity in COVID-19 disease. This is a multiple-collaborative study between Genomic, Imaging research labs and Statistical studies. Research teams in Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM) have established intimate relationships that position the institute to focus their research works on underserved minorities. We plan to develop and disseminate technological approaches in identifying host factors that disproportionately affect AAs COVID-19 infected patients. Given that the discovery, and establishment of translational implementation of novel solutions to health disparities in high-risk minority COVID-19 infected is our overall goals. Recently, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), encoded on the X-chromosome, has been shown to be a functional receptor for COVID-19 to enter host target cells and the concern might arise regarding whether ACE2 variants between and within subgroups would increase the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 infected patients. Therefore, the long-term goal is to compare how genetic variants of the ACE2 receptor, chemokine (CCL2) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes (influence the immune system’s response to viruses and bacteria), affects COVID-19 disease severity among people but no underlining disease like diabetes, heart or lung disease with those with mild or no disease manifestations. Short-term goal; we will focus on two aims; Aim: 1-Determine genetic variations in ACE2 gene on obtained DNA samples from COVID-19 infected patients and evaluate for potential correlation between ACE2 variant frequencies in relationship to COVID-19 disease progression and mortalities between and within AAs and non-Hispanic Caucasian CAs subgroup;. COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2 which uses host cell ACE2, TMPRSS2, EZRIN and other proteins for entry. Differences in ACE2 or TMPRSS2/EZRIN genes expression and SNPs may justify the disease disparity and aim 2 will address how COVID-19 spike engagement with host cell receptor is precisely regulated and how host cells respond to cytokines elicited by COVID-19 infection using lung organoids. A recent correlation study suggested that the decrease expression of ACE2 /TMPRSS2/EZRIN are predictors of decreased susceptibility to COVID-19 infection and could be attributed to COVID-19 morbidity in Africa American patients. Aim-2: Modeling COVID-19-elicited disease disparity using lung organoids. Clinical validation of ACE2 and EZRIN will help to develop better strategies for COVID 19 diagnosis and treatment to reduce the observed COVID-19 disease progressive outcome and mortality gaps between African American and Caucasians patients. . Given the facts of a significant racial disparity in COVID-19 disease among African American (AA) and Caucasians, there is an utmost need to understand the COVID-19 infectivity host factors biology. Apart from socioeconomic factors and underlying comorbidities, AA clearly differ from Caucasians on a number of accounts, including COVID-19 mortalities genetic predisposition, which favors for high incidence and mortality rate COVID- 19 disease manifestations. Studies clearly demonstrate that ACE 2 encoded on the X-chromosome which COVID-19 virus use to entry host may be differentially expressed among individuals, therefore, we propose to determine that ACE2 and other genes, such as Ezrin plays vital role in regulating the COVID-19 virus infectivity resulting in racial disparity and the clinical validation of ACE2 and ezrin will help to develop better strategies for COVID 19 diagnosis and treatment to reduce the observed COVID-19 disease progressive outcome gaps between African American and Caucasians.",Center for Translational Research in

"Signature of profiling and staging the progression of TB from infection to disease. Project Summary/Abstract Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of infectious disease mortality worldwide. Nearly one-third of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). More than 10.4 million new cases of active TB disease develop annually, leading to 1.4 million deaths due to the disease each year. Despite widespread efforts to study of the etiology of disease, the development and global introduction of an effective treatment regimen, and sensitive diagnostics for identifying pulmonary TB disease, efforts to control this pandemic are falling short, largely due to a lack of a clear understanding of the pathogenic progression from MTB infection to active clinical disease. In addition, Existing gene expression studies have presented more than three dozen biomarkers to predict TB related outcomes such as identifying active TB disease, predicting risk of treatment failure, or predicting which patients will progress to active TB disease. These have been developed and refined using multiple technologies and using a diverse set of computational and machine learning prediction algorithms, but most are focused on two-class comparison (e.g. TB vs. LTBI). In this proposal, we propose to compile and harmonize dozens of existing RNA-sequencing datasets for TB outcomes. We will use these compiled data to develop a computational platform and interactive visualization tools for profiling TB signatures across all existing datasets. We plan to use this curated data and software platform to develop a more refined molecular map of progression from TB infection to active disease. Consistent with a recently presented models for TB disease development, we hypothesize that we will be able to identify gene expression patterns associated with stages on the TB disease spectrum, including: uninfected or eliminated infection, controlled or truly latent infection, future progressors or incipient disease, subclinical TB disease, and active clinical TB disease. We believe that existing gene expression data and signatures will allow us to identify distinct transcriptional profiles for each stage, and hence develop a multi-class machine learning approach for classifying patients into their corresponding stage. Overall, this proposal contributes to the field by compiling existing gene expression data and developing a wholistic map of TB progression from infection to active disease. In addition, we will provide a curated dataset and metadata in an accessible format for more than three dozen existing TB studies, and allow others to access and explore these data through a user-friendly profiling platform. Project Narrative We will compile existing TB gene expression data and develop a wholistic map of TB progression from infection to active disease.

"Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify patients at high risk of potentially preventable carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) infection Project Summary Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) cause more than 13,000 infections in U.S. inpatients annually, with mortality rates that can exceed 50%. In hospitals, asymptomatic colonization is emerging as a critical target for CRE infection prevention: epidemiologically, early identification of colonized patients can reduce intra-hospital spread. And clinically, colonized inpatients face significantly higher — but potentially modifiable — risks of CRE infection. Due to diagnostic limitations, however, widescale CRE colonization screening remains impractical for most U.S. hospitals. Prediction models offer alternative strategies for identifying patients at high risk of colonization and of subsequent infection. However, models face two methodological obstacles, limiting their wider utility: (1) strong colonization risk factors are “locked” in electronic health record (EHR) free-text that is unavailable for model-building unless records are reviewed manually; and (2) due to low CRE prevalence, most statistical models can only evaluate limited numbers of candidate variables. We propose to exploit state-of-the-art machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to improve identification of CRE-colonized and infected patients. We will apply these methods to EHRs from >21,000 patients screened for CRE at The University of Maryland and The Johns Hopkins hospitals. In Aim 1, we will build and validate NLP algorithms on admission histories to detect pre-admission exposures that are strong colonization risk factors but poorly captured in structured EHR data fields. NLP is a cutting-edge computational technique for “unlocking” these types of unstructured data. We will also use text-mining approaches to identify potential new or local CRE risk factors. In Aims 2 and 3, we will build and validate models from NLP-derived variables and other EHR data to predict colonization at admission (Aim 2) and progression to infection (Aim 3) using machine learning algorithms that excel on high-dimensional data. Taken together, this work will help hospitals identify patients at high risk of CRE colonization and infection early, when deleterious patient outcomes are still preventable. Because NLP is automated, successful models could be exported to other hospitals and integrated into EHRs; all algorithms resulting from this work will be made freely available. This will be the first study to deploy NLP for bacterial carriage screening and the largest U.S. study to follow CRE-colonized inpatients for infection. As a PhD-trained epidemiologist with a CRE and machine learning background, and who previously practiced FDA law, I am drawn to interdisciplinary, rigorous approaches and policies for reducing the toll of antibiotic resistance in hospitalized patients. In the short-term, Career Development Award support would allow me to build experience using sophisticated computational approaches for EHR-based information extraction and predictive modeling. In the long-term, the skills I acquire would position me as a leader at leveraging novel health information technology tools to design and test new strategies for responding to the threat of antibiotic resistance and other emerging pathogens in U.S. hospitals. Project Narrative Asymptomatic colonization (i.e., carriage) with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE), a type of highly drug-resistant bacteria, poses urgent challenges in U.S. hospitals: undetected colonized patients can transmit CRE to other patients, and colonized patients themselves are at a significantly higher risk of developing CRE infections. Because widescale screening for CRE colonization remains impractical for most U.S. hospitals, hospitals miss critical opportunities to identify patients at high risk of CRE colonization and infection early, when it is still possible to prevent deleterious patient outcomes. We propose to leverage state-of-the-art machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques on electronic health records (EHRs) to improve identification of CRE-colonized and infected patients by: (a) developing and validating natural language processing classifiers to detect established and new CRE risk factors from free-text, narrative EHR data; (b) using NLP-derived variables with EHR structured data to predict CRE colonization at admission; and (c) developing machine learning-based models to predict which CRE-colonized patients will progress to infection during the hospital stay, in order to guide precision medicine-based approaches for interventions.",Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify patients at high risk of potentially preventable carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) infection,10370475,K01HS028363,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,K01,2021,130277,MD-07
"Multi-Modal Wireless COVID Monitoring & Infection Alerts for Concentrated Populations Multi-Modal Wireless COVID Monitoring & Infection Alerts for Concentrated Populations Abstract: The high aerosolized transmissibility of COVID, long asymptomatic incubation period, and highly variable presentation attributes of the COVID pandemic have proven challenging in many settings where patchwork pandemic responses have disproportionately negatively impacted vulnerable socioeconomic, minority, and disabled sub-populations. Unfortunately, these dire trends are only made more acute in settings that feature populations with limited mobility and little to no ability to self-isolate (dense concentrated populations [DCPs]), such as residential nursing homes, schools, drug rehabilitation services, prison and psychiatric facility populations, and high-frequency essential medical services, such as chemotherapy infusion clinics or dialysis units. In these DCP settings, limited diagnostic testing, prolonged indoor contact, limitations in cleaning and filtration capacities, support staff shortages, pre-existing comorbidities, and lack of effective infectious disease surveillance systems all collude to drive an increased COVID burden in DCPs. From this, it is clear that alternative detection strategies for DCPs are urgently needed to improve local capacity to monitor COVID outbreaks, mitigate their spread, and thus reduce inequitable disease and mortality burdens in these under-resourced and often overcrowded settings. In previous work, we developed a first generation detection system using heart rate data from commercially-available Fitbit Ionic wearable devices to detect the onset of COVID and other infectious diseases up to 10 days before users self-reported symptom onset (overall sensitivity 67% prior to symptom onset). Here, we propose to further develop this system for the improved detection of COVID and other infectious diseases in DCPs using existing wearable fitness devices in a wireless and interoperable digital health framework that centralizes all wearable-derived data on PHD while tailoring its presentation and health event alert system to the IT capabilities and needs of each DCP setting. In this, not only will we adapt our existing infection detection algorithms for each DCP’s particular baseline characteristics, IT infrastructure, and needs, but also use incoming data to further optimize the performance of those algorithms for continuous improvement in the sensitivity, specificity, and alert lead time for COVID onset. This will quickly enable under-resourced DCP support staff to access and use world-class COVID surveillance data in identifying individual infection events, implementing isolation, cleaning, and testing policies, and minimizing transmission, thus reducing the burden of COVID in DCP settings and reducing DCP morbidity and mortality overall. Multi-Modal Wireless COVID Monitoring & Infection Alerts for Concentrated Populations Narrative: The myriad risks and health burdens accompanying the ongoing COVID pandemic have disproportionately impacted under-resourced settings with dense, concentrated populations that cannot readily transition to isolation or remote care. While diagnostic testing is increasingly available, it remains inaccessible to too many and highlights an urgent unmet need for alternative methods to detect COVID infection and spread. In previous work using online machine learning and commercially-available fitness wearables, we have demonstrated remote detection of COVID onset up to 7 days in advance of symptoms, which we here propose to optimize and extend to diverse dense concentrated population settings for ongoing and effective COVID surveillance.",Multi-Modal Wireless COVID Monitoring & Infection Alerts for

"Modifiable Risk Factors for the Emergence of Resistance to Pseudomonas aeruginosa Project Summary Carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CR-P. aeruginosa) contributes to significant mortality in hospitalized patients. Only four β-lactam agents with activity against CR-P. aeruginosa are available in the US, of which ceftolozane-tazobactam (C-T) is the most frequently used to treat CR-P. aeruginosa. Pre-clinical investigations indicate C-T had activity against >90% of P. aeruginosa isolates; after clinical use, reports of P. aeruginosa that initially tested susceptible to C-T but became resistant during therapy emerged. Our preliminary data indicate that amongst 28 consecutive patients infected with CR-P. aeruginosa with isolates initially susceptible to C-T, 50% of patients had subsequent P. aeruginosa isolates with > 4-fold increase in C-T minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) up to 30 days after C-T exposure. We identified genetic markers contributing to resistance through whole genome sequencing (WGS) – notably mutations in the ampC-ampR region and in PBP3. Alarmingly, 86% of P. aeruginosa isolates initially susceptible to another novel antibiotic, ceftazidime-avibactam (C-A), exhibited resistance to C-A after C-T exposure - in the absence of C-A exposure. This is concerning as the emergence of resistance to one novel agent could eliminate the few remaining treatment options. We explored modifiable risk factors that could reduce the frequency of C-T resistance and found that 30% of patients who received C-T over 1 hour had subsequent C-T resistant isolates, whereas no patients who received the drug over 3 hours developed resistant isolates. We would like to repeat this exploratory work and include experimental validation studies in a cohort of 260 patients across seven hospitals who have paired P. aeruginosa clinical isolates stored at -80°C and were prescribed C-T. In Aim 1, WGS will identify the genetic loci associated with C-T resistance comparing paired CR-P. aeruginosa isolates from the same patient before and up to 30 days after C-T exposure. Validation will occur through cloning and site-directed mutagenesis work. Broth microdilution will determine susceptibility testing results for the three other β-lactams with activity against CR-P. aeruginosa to quantify the emergence of cross-resistance. In Aim 2, we will capitalize on diverse C-T administration strategies at participating sites and develop a machine learning derived decision tree to inform clinicians how to prescribe C-T most effectively to reduce the likelihood of acquired resistance. The following are some risk factors that will be investigated for potential inclusion: (1) infusion of C-T over 3 hours, (2) high-dose C-T, (3) combination antibiotic therapy, (4) dialysis dependency, (5) source of infection and source control, (6) number of days of C-T exposure. This work will (1) inform future drug development by identifying areas of the bacterial chromosome highly prone to resistance and in need of additional reinforcement and (2) identify modifiable risk factors that can be used by clinicians to enable novel antibiotics to remain effective treatment options for extended periods of time. Project Narrative Only four β-lactam antibiotics with activity against carbapenem-resistant-P. aeruginosa are available in the United States, of which ceftolozane-tazobactam (C-T) is the most frequently prescribed. Our preliminary data indicate that high-level resistance of CR-P. aeruginosa to C-T can occur shortly after clinical exposure to this agent. Using a cohort of 260 patients contributing paired CR-P. aeruginosa isolates before and after C-T exposure, we propose to: (1) identify and experimentally validate genetic markers leading to C-T resistance; (2) determine the frequency with which C-T resistance leads to cross-resistance to the three other β-lactam agents with activity against C-T; and (3) develop a machine-learning derived decision tree to inform clinicians of modifiable risk factors that could slow the emergence of resistance to C-T.",Modifiable Risk Factors for the Emergence of Resistance to Pseudomonas aeruginosa,10301838,R21AI153580,"['Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Combined Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Combinations ', ' Antibiotic Drug Combinations ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Ceftazidime ', ' Bacterial Chromosomes ', ' Cloning ', ' Decision Trees ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Dialysis ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Drug resistance ', ' drug resistant ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Hospitals ', ' Imipenem ', ' Imipemide ', ' N-Formimidoylthienamycin ', ' Infection ', ' Laboratories ', ' Monobactams ', ' Lactam Antibiotics ', ' Monobactam Antibiotics ', ' Monocyclic beta-Lactams ', ' beta lactam antibiotic ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Patients ', ' Pseudomonas aeruginosa ', ' P aeruginosa ', ' P. aeruginosa ', ' Pseudomonas pyocyanea ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Tazobactam ', ' Site-Directed Mutagenesis ', ' Site-Specific Mutagenesis ', ' Targeted DNA Modification ', ' Targeted Modification ', ' Regrets ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Case Series ', ' Point Mutation ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' beta-Lactams ', ' β-Lactams ', ' Exposure to ', ' Antibiotic Treatment ', ' bacterial disease treatment ', ' bacterial infectious disease treatment ', ' Antibiotic Therapy ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' anti-microbial susceptibility ', ' Antimicrobial susceptibility ', ' Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations ', ' Minimum Inhibitory Concentration measurement ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Source ', ' Test Result ', ' respiratory ', ' Infusion ', ' Infusion procedures ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' validation studies ', ' Reporting ', ' drug development ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' genome sequencing ', ' VDAC1 ', ' pore forming protein ', ' porin ', ' VDAC1 gene ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Validation ', ' urinary ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' pathogen ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' modifiable risk ', ' malleable risk ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' combat ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' carbapenem resistance ', ' carbapenem resistant ', ' resistance to carbapenem ', ' resistant to carbapenem ', ' clinical investigation ', ' individual patient ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection ', ' P. aeruginosa infection ', ' infected with P. aeruginosa ', ' infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa ', ' genomic locus ', ' gene locus ', ' genetic locus ', ' ']",NIAID,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,275758,MD-07
"An integrative, data-driven, and computational approach to uncovering dynamic mechanisms of early viral infection Project Summary Cutting-edge technologies are generating large datasets across biological processes, including those following viral infection and host responses. However, lack of computational tools that can extract meaningful insights, and lack of ability to integrate information across different model systems and data modalities, are roadblocks to deriving biological and mechanistic understanding of these processes. The recent rise of devastating viruses including SARS family viruses reveals that a deeper, basic mechanistic understanding of viral infection is still lacking. Specifically, new insights into early viral infection (asymptomatic replication phase) and early-responding genes that govern infection and disease outcome are critical for understanding progression of infection and host responses. During my postdoctoral research, I developed several widely-used algorithms for biomedical machine learning and single-cell data analysis, and applied these to a broad range of biological systems, including infectious disease. Here, I propose to develop a completely new approach that is founded in cross-modal computational analysis and can be applied to dynamic processes across living systems. In this proposal, the method will be trained upon and applied to uncovering virus infection dynamics. By leveraging single-cell technologies, combinatorial CRISPR perturbation, and advanced machine learning, this new approach will learn the gene regulatory logic that governs infection. By spanning model systems, I will extract information that can be derived more cleanly from in-vitro systems, such as early infection timepoints. Through cross-integration of these data with in-vivo data from mouse models we will bring the precision questions that can be asked in human organoids together with the physiological environment of animal models, powering our ability to derive relevant insights into gene networks underlying a complex, dynamic process. I will build a single-cell atlas of virus infection and train a machine learning algorithm to obtain a predictive model of infection dynamics. By also integrating data from single-cell combinatorial CRISPR perturbation, I will infer causal gene networks as well as synergistic gene interactions that govern infection dynamics. This combination of advanced machine learning methods, large-scale single-cell analysis, and gene perturbation data will allow discovery of the drivers of infection, signatures of both susceptibility and protection, and gene networks that can ultimately be targeted for therapeutic intervention. Synergistic gene interactions will open up future paths to potentially more effective, specific, and even combinatorial therapies. The innovative coupling of computational methods and deep data collection to extract information, particularly during early infection phases, has the potential to fundamentally change our understanding of viral infections, as well as provide a framework that can be applied to a broad range of biological processes and diseases to obtain deep mechanistic understanding. Project Narrative Using data driven and computational approaches we will reveal fundamental mechanisms underlying viral infection, focusing on model systems that give insight into early, dynamic infection processes in diverse tissues, organisms, pathogens, and disease backgrounds. Gene networks and synergistic gene interactions causally related to infection will be inferred using our novel computational tools, thus uncovering signatures of protection and providing an invaluable resource for the community. The proposal promises to build approaches applicable across biological systems and processes, change our mechanistic understanding of viral infection, and, in the future, support therapeutic design.","An integrative, data-driven, and computational approach to uncovering dynamic mechanisms of early viral infection",10276969,R35GM143072,"['Algorithms ', ' Atlases ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Infection ', ' Learning ', ' Logic ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Organoids ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Technology ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' viral infection ', ' virus infection ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' Virus ', ' Guidelines ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Therapeutic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' gene interaction ', ' single cell analysis ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' SARS ', ' SARS coronavirus disease ', ' SARS-CoV disease ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV disease ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus disease ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Process ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' data integration ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' pathogen ', ' Coupling ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' combinatorial ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' biological systems ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' CRISPR ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' single cell technology ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' causal variant ', ' causal allele ', ' causal gene ', ' causal mutation ', ' causative mutation ', ' causative variant ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIGMS,YALE UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,418750,CT-03
"Predictive Personalized Public Health (P3H): A Novel Paradigm to Treat Infectious Disease Challenge, Innovation and Impact: In recent years, we have demonstrated that it is feasible to predict epidemic disease outbreaks from retrospective seasonal and geographical case data and to show that we can take climate factors into account in our predictive models. We are moving closer to real-time prediction at the population level. But we have never used prediction at point-of-care for treating the individual patient.  Presently, personalized medicine uses delayed results of laboratory testing of individuals. For infectious disease, most of such testing has targeted the pathogen in the host-pathogen interaction. The role of laboratory testing is to modify therapy after a variable period of time delay. Personalized medicine today is reactive. Complicating matters further, many infectious epidemic diseases are strongly dependent on environmental factors and climate. Lastly, we want to name the pathogens we are fighting, but we really need to know the resistance characteristics to select therapy for patients effectively. Both speciation and resistance can now be determined from molecular data, which can be integrated into point-of-care treatment predictions.  We here propose a radically different approach to the treatment of infectious diseases. Our hypothesis is that the alternative to time-delayed and expensive laboratory analysis of specimens from individual patients, is to use predictive modeling to forecast point-of-care treatment. Time-delayed personalized testing can be conducted as surveillance, and that data used for real-time prediction to guide point-of-care treatment.  We will introduce predictive personalized public health (P3H) policy at the individual patient level, with the potential to substantially improve patient outcomes compared with our present reactive approaches. Our key rationale is to expand population infectious disease predictive modeling in order to achieve prediction for treatment at point-of-care. Our primary insight is that we can reposition the delayed reactive personalized testing from the urgent medical decision-making process, and into a predictive modeling framework. The gaps and opportunities in technology that we will address are four-fold. First, we will employ individual case geospatial mapping at a fine scale to take into account infection spread and environmental factors. Second, our ability to perform pan-microbial analysis using molecular techniques is now feasible. Third, modeling our novel fusion of data has no simple low-dimensional solution – but machine learning technologies are now capable of handling such big data assimilation, model discovery and prediction. Fourth, our proposal is not an academic exercise. We have a partnership with the economic planners within a developing country to design and implement our new methods. We will prospectively tune and validate our algorithms in real-time. Our deliverable will be an open-source framework ready for clinical trials testing and adaptation to the public health infrastructure in any country. Project Narrative We have made substantial progress in our abilities to track and predict infectious disease epidemics at the population level, but prediction has never been used at the individual level to guide treatment at point-of-care. The individual treatment for all infectious disease syndromes at point-of-care is presently empirical, because laboratory testing is reactive and time delayed. We here propose a novel framework to use rigorous prediction strategies to guide point-of-care treatment for infectious diseases, and to validate this approach under real-world conditions.",Predictive Personalized Public Health (P3H): A Novel Paradigm to Treat Infectious Disease,10241253,R01AI145057,"['Algorithms ', ' Bacteriology ', ' Cholera ', ' Climate ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' developing country ', ' developing nation ', ' Diarrhea ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Economics ', ' Engineering ', ' Epidemic ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Exanthema ', ' Exanthem ', ' Rash ', ' Skin Rash ', ' Exercise ', ' Fever ', ' Pyrexia ', ' febrile ', ' febris ', ' Geography ', ' Hand ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hybrids ', ' Infant ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Newborns ', ' newborn child ', ' newborn children ', ' Infection ', ' Investments ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leadership ', ' Leptospirosis ', ' Malaria ', ' Paludism ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Measles ', ' Rubeola ', ' morbilli ', ' Melioidosis ', ' Meningitis ', ' Methods ', ' Microbiology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Names ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Public Health ', ' Rain ', ' rainfall ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Genus staphylococcus ', ' Staphylococcus ', ' Syndrome ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Uganda ', ' Work ', ' Bacterial Meningitis ', ' Assimilations ', ' spreading factor ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' developed country ', ' developed nation ', ' developed nations ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fighting ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Reaction ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Palsy ', ' Plegia ', ' paralysis ', ' paralytic ', ' Paralysed ', ' authority ', ' microbial ', ' novel ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' global health ', ' Data ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict treatment response ', ' therapy prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' infectious disease treatment ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' point of care ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Sepsis ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' pathogen ', ' infectious disease model ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' flu ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' antimicrobial ', ' anti-microbial ', ' open source ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' surveillance data ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' resistance gene ', ' resistance locus ', ' resistant gene ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' Medical emergency ', ' climate data ', ' climatic data ', ' climatological data ', ' individual patient ', ' cost outcomes ', ' personalized predictions ', ' Individualized Predictors ', ' individualized predictions ', ' personalized predictors ', ' acute infection ', ' Infrastructure ', ' data fusion ', ' antigen test ', ' antigen based test ', ' infant infection ', ' infected infant ', ' ']",NIAID,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2021,1650504,PA-10
"Successful Clinical Response In Pneumonia Therapy (SCRIPT) Systems Biology Center Modified Project Summary/Abstract Section  This innovative integrated systems biology application seeks to delineate the complex host/pathogen interactions occurring at the alveolar level that lead to unsuccessful response to therapy in serious pneumonia, including serious viral pneumonia. To achieve this objective, we will leverage our unique access to alveolar fluid collected as part of routine clinical care in mechanically ventilated patients with suspected pneumonia in our medical intensive care unit. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid will be obtained serially from well characterized mechanically ventilated patients with serious viral or Pseudomonas or Acinetobacter bacterial pneumonias. Both of these CDC-designated serious hazard level bacterial pathogens have clinical failure rates as high as 50%. A robust clinical definition will allow comparison of both host and pathogen signatures associated with failure of therapy vs. success. These clinical specimens and extensive patient phenomics will anchor two mutually supportive and iterative research projects. Project One will deploy robust tools for flow sorting macrophage and lymphocyte subset populations, isolating RNA from these populations, and performing transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis to compare successful and unsuccessful host response. Project Two will focus on both specific pathogen genomic profiles associated with unsuccessful outcome and the differential microbiome response. Specific pathogen genomic profiles identified will be tested for causality in a unique humanized alveolar macrophage mouse model by the Technology Core. Changes in microbiome communities will be comprehensively assessed by shotgun deep sequencing to detect bacteriophage, other virus, and fungal DNA, in addition to bacterial. A Technical Core will perform cell sorting of BAL macrophage and lymphocyte subsets, RNA sequencing, and whole genome methylation, as well as perform the mouse pneumonia model studies. A Data Management and Bioinformatics Core will develop tools to reduce the dimensionality of these large comprehensive datasets, including the clinical phenomics, and provide them to the Modeling Core. The Modeling Core will then use an ecosystem-based approach to this complex adaptive system combined with unique machine learning tools and neural networks to generate biomarkers of host, pathogen and/or microbiome patterns predictive of successful pneumonia outcome. Predictive biomarkers developed in the Modeling Core will then be validated in a prospective confirmatory cohort of patients in whom analogous data will be generated.

"Inflammatory and Metabolic Biomarkers in Cardiovascular Complications with SARS-CoV-2 One of the most poorly understood yet clinically important aspects of the novel COVID-19 SARS CoV2 coronavirus is the marked heterogeneity that it displays with infection severity and with development of end organ complications and mortality. SARS CoV-2 infection has a complex epidemiologic interplay with cardiovascular (CVD) and highlights this complex heterogeneity. The biology underlying this heterogeneity in CVD outcomes is poorly understood and concomitantly, clinically useful biomarkers do not currently exist to identify the highest risk patients in need of the most intense monitoring. Thus, we propose to use integrated omics and EHR data in a diverse multi-center North Carolina cohort with existing biological specimens to determine the role of inflammation, metabolism and novel molecular mechanisms, and identify biomarkers of CVD outcomes in patients with COVID-19. We propose to (1) Determine the clinical predictors of infection severity in a diverse population of individuals with CVD risk factors and SARS-CoV2 infection including evaluation of racial differences; (2) Determine the role of inflammatory, SARS-CoV-2 related, and other candidate proteins as biomarkers of infection severity and CVD outcomes in patients with SARS CoV-2 infection; and (3) Evaluate metabolic pathways in SARS Co-V-2 infection severity and CVD outcomes. The proposal has high potential for dissecting the molecular mechanisms of the heterogeneity between CVD and SARS CoV-2 outcomes. Importantly, it has great short-term potential for clinically important results that will lead to earlier and better identification of high-risk patients for more intensive monitoring; novel therapeutic interventions to prevent end organ complications and mortality; and diagnostic and disease-progression biomarkers. As the COVID-19 pandemic has progressed, it is emerging that patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and pre-existing CVD appear to have a worse severity of infection. Furthermore, CVD complications appear to be relatively common in patients with COVID-19 regardless of pre-existing CVD. Unfortunately, it is difficult to predict who will develop the most severe infection and who will develop CVD complications. Technologies have evolved such that hundreds of proteins and other markers and millions of genetic markers can be rapidly measured in small amounts of blood. Thus, in this proposal, we will use these cutting-edge technologies in blood samples collected from patients with COVID-19 from two large medical centers in North Carolina, to identify biomarkers that can tell us those patients who will have the most severe infections and those patients who have suffer CVD complications, as well as identifying the genes that may predispose patients to these

"Large-scale profiling of microbial and metabolic interactions between C. difficile and gut microbiota using ultrahigh-throughput droplet microfluidics PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is a major antibiotic resistant intestinal pathogen that is a leading cause of antibiotic associated diarrhea and colitis which, in severe cases, can lead to death. Treatment with antibiotics frequently leads to recurrence of the infection, which is then treated with fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). In this case, a fecal sample from a healthy donor is transplanted into a patient with C. difficile infection, which has been shown to prevent recurrence of infections. Notably, FMT can lead to negative health outcomes including death due to the potential transmission of pathogens and uncharacterized factors in the samples. The observed efficacy of FMT suggests that commensal gut bacteria play a critical role in suppressing infection caused by C. difficile. Previous studies have elucidated specific molecular mechanisms that can influence C. difficile colonization including exploitation of key nutrients available in the inflamed gut and secondary bile acids. We postulate that there are diverse classes of ecological and molecular mechanisms mediating protection from C. difficile depending on the ecological and environmental context. Indeed, treatments of C. difficile infection based on defined microbiota have not proven successful. To elucidate the diverse classes of mechanisms, we propose to develop a droplet microfluidic workflow to construct millions of synthetic human gut communities, screen these consortia based on the abundance of C. difficile and determine species composition of the sorted “hits.” Combining this method with exo-metabolomics and machine learning techniques, we will infer microbial interactions and metabolite effectors impacting C. difficile growth. A detailed understanding of the diverse community types and metabolic properties that suppress C. difficile growth will be a major advance towards designing safe and effective treatments for this major intestinal pathogen. PROJECT NARRATIVE The antibiotic resistant intestinal pathogen Clostrodiodes difficile (C. difficile) is the leading cause of hospital- acquired infections in the US and there are a rising number of community-acquired cases with substantial associated morbidity and mortality. To understand the complex ecological and environmental factors that impact the growth of C. difficile in the gut microbiome, we aim to develop and apply a novel method for quantifying C. difficile growth in millions of synthetic human gut microbiome communities. Equipped with this data, we will use machine learning techniques to decipher the metabolite features and microbe-microbe interactions driving C. difficile growth.",Large-scale profiling of microbial and metabolic interactions between C. difficile and gut microbiota using ultrahigh-throughput droplet microfluidics,10193322,R21AI159980,"['Affect ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Bile Acids ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biomass ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Colitis ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Environment ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infection ', ' Intestines ', ' Intestinal ', ' bowel ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Mathematical Modeling of Influenza Severity in Outbred Mice PROJECT SUMMARY In the United States, pulmonary influenza infection occurs annually in 5-20% of the population with mortality in the range of 30,000 deaths. The recent 2009 influenza H1N1 pandemic illustrated the potential for higher infection rates, which were reported to be as high as 45% in certain age groups. The 2017-18 influenza season had the highest pediatric mortalities since the 2009 pandemic. Influenza infection is known to result in a broad spectrum of disease phenotypes in humans, although severe pneumonia is relatively rare. Despite this, severe disease often requires advanced supportive care in the young, including previously healthy children. Host factors involved in determining the outcome of influenza infection are unclear and children are known to be at higher risk of severe disease. First life exposure to influenza is also thought to dictate life-long immunity. Little is known about the effects of young age and gender on influenza responses and severity. This underscores the importance of understanding influenza pathogenesis in a pediatric population. Influenza pathogenesis is likely mediated in large part by exuberant inflammatory host responses in the lung. It is likely that predictive soluble inflammatory mediators are present in severe infection. Further, predictive biomarkers or mathematical models of influenza pneumonia severity would enhance clinical decision making and patient care. We propose that machine learning and mathematical modeling of host immune endpoints will define a molecular fingerprint of severe influenza pneumonia in juveniles. This hypothesis will be tested in two Aims. Aim 1 will focus on characteristic molecular pathways related to influenza severity in juvenile animals, using outbred mice. We will utilize machine learning and new mathematical approaches for pathway and biomarker selection. Aim 2 will test mathematical models of influenza pathogenesis to elucidate new mechanisms that drive lung injury. The overall goal of the proposed study is to identify novel biomarkers and mechanistic models of influenza pneumonia severity that can be applied to children. To accomplish this we will use a broad, exploratory, and unbiased approach. Candidate biomarkers and pathways would then be evaluated in future mechanistic and translational studies in mice and humans. NARRATIVE  Pneumonia is the leading cause of death in children worldwide. There is a critical clinical need for biomarkers and models that predict influenza pneumonia severity in children. The goal of this study is to address this unmet need using an outbred mouse model of pediatric influenza pneumonia and well established mathematical approaches to inform future translational studies in children.",Mathematical Modeling of Influenza Severity in Outbred Mice,10143642,R21AI153882,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Flow Cytometry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometries ', ' Flow Cytofluorometry ', ' Flow Microfluorimetry ', ' Flow Microfluorometry ', ' flow cytophotometry ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Histology ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Immunity ', ' Infection ', ' Influenza ', ' Grippe ', ' Interferons ', ' IFN ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Merging machine learning and mechanistic models to improve prediction and inference in emerging epidemics PROJECT SUMMARY When an outbreak of an established or emerging infectious disease occurs we ask a standard set of questions that are critical to a lifesaving public health response: Where will future incidence occur? How many cases will there be? And where can we most effectively intervene? The proposed research is motivated by real world instances where answering these questions was critical to making practical public health decisions, and current methods came up short: from deciding if and where to build additional Ebola Treatment Units in the 2014-15 West African Ebola epidemic, to identifying priority districts where oral cholera vaccine should be used in the 2016-17 cholera outbreak in Yemen, to picking locations where sufficient cases might occur to selecting and prioritizing interventions to slow the spread of COVID-19 worldwide. Forecasts informing such decisions are typically generated either using an epidemic model that relies on knowledge of the disease transmission mechanism and epidemic theory or using a statistical model to project the expected number of cases based on the relationship between covariates and observed counts. However, both approaches are subject to limitations, particularly early in an epidemic when few cases are observed. This project is based on the overarching scientific premise that inferences that combine the strengths of mechanistic epidemic models and statistical covariate models will substantially outperform either approach alone in forecasting and making decisions to confront emerging infectious disease threats. Specifically, this project aims to (1) Develop a framework to forecast incidence in ongoing outbreaks that merges mechanistic and machine learning approaches; (2) Validate the framework using retrospective data and apply the framework to inform decision making in emerging epidemics; (3) Integrate this inferential forecasting framework into causal decision theory to optimize critical actions in the public health response to emerging epidemics; and (4) Develop accessible and extensible tools for forecasting and decision analysis in infectious disease epidemics. We will validate these approaches using rigorous simulation studies and by applying the proposed approaches to retrospective data from important recent epidemics (e.g., Ebola, Cholera and COVID-19, as mentioned above). We will prospectively apply our approach to inform the response to emerging disease threats that occur during the project period, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. To ensure that the tools developed are useful, efficient, and user friendly, we will work with international humanitarian organizations responding to epidemics. Successful completion of these aims will provide a flexible and validated framework for forecasting and decision making during ongoing epidemics, while allowing for innovation in mechanistic and statistical approaches. In doing so it will provide tools to optimize responses and reduce morbidity and mortality during public health crises. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of the proposed project is to improve inference, forecasting and decision making in response to emerging infectious diseases by developing a framework to integrate mechanistic and statistical approaches to epidemic modeling and causal inference. Approaches developed will be validated using simulations and retrospective data and applied prospectively to reduce morbidity and mortality in emerging public health crises.

"Predicting tuberculosis outcomes using genotypic and biomarker signatures PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by an infectious pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) in susceptible individuals, but we cannot yet classify or predict outcomes in those prone to pulmonary TB disease versus those prone to resistance. In part, this reflects knowledge gaps regarding genotypes that may increase susceptibility, and in validated disease correlates (e.g. serum of lung protein biomarkers) measured individually, or combined signatures. We address these knowledge gaps by using Diversity Outbred (DO) mice, a population with abundant genetic diversity and heterozygosity, like the human population. Also, like humans, a low dose M.tb infection of DO mice produces a spectrum of outcomes, from highly susceptible to highly resistant, and many intermediate outcomes. In this proposal, we use the DO population to: 1) Identify and test the capacity of genotypic (alleles and statistically significant loci) to predict outcomes such as diagnostic category (class); and 2) To identify and test lung and serum biomarker (protein) and granuloma signatures to determine diagnostic category (class); and 3) To identify and test serum biomarker (protein) signatures that can forecast disease onset, within a 3-week window before illness manifests clinically. The best performing signatures will be tested using samples from humans. Collectively, results from these studies will generate new translatable knowledge regarding correlates of pulmonary TB (useful for diagnostics), and genotypic and serum protein signatures (useful for prognostics). PROJECT NARRATIVE Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) causes tuberculosis (TB) in millions of susceptible humans each year.

"Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Coccidioidomycosis Project Summary/Abstract: Coccidioidomycosis, caused by the highly infectious dimorphic fungi Coccidioides posadasii and C. immitis, inflicts a heavy and rapidly growing burden of disease, with 150,000 new cases annually in the United States. Clinical symptoms of coccidioidomycosis are highly variable, depending on the degree of exposure and robustness of host cell-mediated immunity – 40% of exposed individuals develop an acute primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis syndrome indistinguishable from regular community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). While most of these patients eventually resolve their infection, 41-43% are hospitalized for a median of 6 days, with disabling symptoms lasting several months. A subset of patients, especially individuals with impaired cell-mediated immunity, progress to other, more severe coccidioidal clinical syndromes, including disseminated infection, with high rates of morbidity and death. Although coccidioidomycosis causes 30% of CAP cases in highly endemic regions, the clinical presentation is challenging to differentiate from viral or bacterial CAP and available diagnostic tests have significant limitations, leading to median diagnostic delays of 23-48 days, with many patients having delays lasting several months. Meanwhile, patients seek medical care for their symptoms, with unnecessary hospitalizations, exposure to empiric broad- spectrum antibiotics, laboratory tests, imaging, and invasive procedures. A critical barrier to improving clinical outcomes in these patients is the lack of reliable diagnostic methods that identify coccidioidomycosis early in the course of infection and distinguish it from other common infections with a similar clinical presentation. Once coccidioidomycosis is diagnosed, it is also challenging to determine whether patients are responding to antifungal therapy, due to slow resolution of symptoms and abnormal imaging and laboratory findings. To address this unmet need, we propose a novel approach to the diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis based on detection of fungal volatile metabolites in the breath. We will test the hypotheses that (a) patients with coccidioidomycosis have unique breath metabolites that differentiate them from patients with other infections, and (b) kinetics of these metabolites predict responses to antifungal therapy. We will: (1) identify breath volatile metabolites that distinguish patients with coccidioidomycosis from those with similar clinical syndromes, including CAP and other mycoses, and (2) examine the relationship between early changes in these breath metabolites in patients with coccidioidomycosis treated with antifungal therapy and their clinical outcome. Successful completion of these aims will lay the groundwork for a novel assay for the direct detection of Coccidioides metabolism that can be coupled to a point-of-care gas sensor system for the rapid, bedside identification of patients with coccidioidomycosis, reducing diagnostic delays, guiding appropriate initiation of treatment in patients at risk for severe or disseminated disease, averting unnecessary antibiotic use, and improving clinical outcomes in patients with this morbid, life-threatening infection. Project Narrative Coccidioidomycosis, or Valley Fever, inflicts a heavy and growing burden of disease in the Americas, with over 150,000 new cases per year in the United States alone. Because symptoms of Valley Fever are nonspecific and currently available diagnostic tests are unable to differentiate Valley Fever from other infections early in the course of infection, patients are often only diagnosed weeks to several months after they initially present with symptoms. We will identify fungal metabolites in the breath that (a) can be used to diagnose Valley Fever earlier in the course of infection than currently possible, differentiating it from other fungal infections and other common infections such as viral or bacterial community-acquired pneumonia, and (b) allow monitoring of the clinical response to antifungal therapy, with the ultimate goal of improving clinical outcomes in patients with this highly debilitating and life-threatening infection.",Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Coccidioidomycosis,10110180,R21AI156279,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Americas ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Arizona ', ' Aspergillosis ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Boston ', ' Gas Chromatography ', ' vapor phase chromatography ', ' Coccidioides ', ' Coccidioides immitis ', ' C immitis ', ' C. immitis ', ' Coccidioidomycosis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' fungus ', ' Gases ', ' Goals ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Histoplasmosis ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Cellular Immunity ', ' Cell Mediated Immunology ', ' Cell-Mediated Immunity ', ' Infection ', ' Kinetics ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Mass Fragmentography ', ' GC MS ', ' GCMS ', ' Gas-Liquid-Mass Spectrometry Chromatography ', ' Mass Fragmentographies ', ' Mass-Gas Chromatography Spectrometry ', ' Mass-Gas Chromatography Spectrum Analysis ', ' ion trap mass spectrometry ', ' mass fragmentometry ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mycoses ', ' Fungus Diseases ', ' fungal infection ', ' fungus infection ', ' Paracoccidioidomycosis ', ' South American Blastomycosis ', ' paracoccidioidal mycosis ', ' Patients ', ' Risk ', ' Sesquiterpenes ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Immunocompromised Host ', ' Immunocompromised ', ' Immunocompromised Patient ', ' Immunosuppressed Host ', ' immunosuppressed patient ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Caring ', ' desert fever ', ' Desert rheumatism ', ' San Joaquin Valley fever ', ' Valley Fever ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Serology ', ' Medical ', ' Laboratory Finding ', ' Lab Findings ', ' Individual ', ' Exposure to ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Life ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' Visit ', ' laboratory facility ', ' tandem mass spectrometry ', ' anti-fungal therapy ', ' fungal infectious disease treatment ', ' Antifungal Therapy ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Monitor ', ' point of care ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' pathogen ', ' prospective ', ' Coupled ', ' Impairment ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' Coccidioides posadasii ', ' C posadasii ', ' C. posadasii ', ' clinical predictors ', ' prognostic value ', ' prognostic ability ', ' prognostic power ', ' prognostic utility ', ' Antibody Response ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' predicting response ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' Primary Infection ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' disabling symptom ', ' debilitating symptom ', ' bacterial community ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' community acquired pneumonia ', ' community associated pneumonia ', ' ']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2021,278671,MA-07
"A ""Culture"" Shift: Integrated Bacterial Screening and Antibacterial Susceptibility Test on Microfluidic Digital Array for Bloodstream Infections PROJECT SUMMARY The ability for clinicians to effectively treat bacterial infections with targeted antibacterials in the acute-care settings hinges on diagnostics capable of identifying the pathogen broadly and determining its susceptibility to antibacterials in a timely manner. Bloodstream infection (BSI) is a particularly representative disease because it is the leading cause of death due to infections with rapid disease progression. Unfortunately, the inconvenient delay of blood culture for definitive diagnosis contributes to widespread empiric use of broad- spectrum antibacterials and emergence of multi-drug-resistant pathogens. Toward addressing this critical unmet need, we propose to develop a new molecular diagnostic platform that integrates bacterial detection, species identification (ID), and antibacterial susceptibility testing (AST) from blood samples in a streamlined test. The expected sample-to-answer turnaround time is 90 min for ID and as early as 2-3 hr for AST. Such integrated diagnostic solution within the proposed timeframe will transform acute-care clinicians’ ability to establish diagnosis of bacterial infections, need for infection control, and antibacterial treatment based on objective data to improve clinical outcome. Using an innovative microfluidic digital array chip for assaying single cells as a backbone technology, we propose to develop a new molecular diagnostic platform which promises rapid ID and AST and allows customizable workflow and assay tailored to the clinical scenario while adjustable based on real-time results. The array chip seamlessly integrates digitization of cells, brief incubation (under various drug conditions), single-cell PCR (scPCR) or reverse transcriptase PCR (scRT-PCR) and single-cell high-resolution melt (scHRM). Thereby, bacterial pathogen can be detected at the level of single-cells, identified based on species- specific melt curves, and their antibacterial susceptibility profile subsequently assessed by measuring changes in rRNA level as a biosynthetic marker of cell viability. ScPCR/scRT-PCR enables sensitive detection and absolute quantification of rRNA of individual cells critical to rapid and reliable differentiation between viable and no-viable cells; while scHRM overcomes a key limitation of bulk HRM to resolve multiple species for diagnosing polymicrobial infections or discarding contaminations. Since both ID and AST do not rely on culture, they reduce total turnaround time from days to minutes/hours. We have assembled a superb team of multi-disciplinary investigators and industry advisors with complementary expertise and strong track record of team science. We propose the following aims:1) to develop a streamlined BSI diagnostic protocol for integrated ID and AST; 2) to develop a microfluidic array chip that enables ID and AST with single-cell resolution; 3) to develop instrument and analysis programs for single- cell ID and AST; and 4) to demonstrate the single-cell diagnostic platform, we will perform analytical and pilot clinical validation studies.

"Integrating epidemiologic and environmental approaches to understand and predict Coccidioides exposure and coccidioidomycosis emergence Project Summary Coccidioidomycosis is an infection caused by inhalation of spores from the soil-dwelling fungi Coccidioides immitis or C. posadasii, and can lead to chronic lung infection, meningitis, or death. Southwestern states are currently experiencing among the highest incidence rates of coccidioidomycosis ever recorded. The disease has levied a substantial human and economic burden throughout the southwest, totaling an estimated $2.2 billion in charges in California alone for coccidioidomycosis-associated hospitalizations from 2000-2011. Critical gaps in understanding have hindered the public health response, including how dust, pathogen, and individual risk factors interact to determine disease incidence, as well as how environmental factors influence the distribution of the pathogen and dust. To address these gaps, this project investigates the impacts of dust exposure, environmental variability, and sociodemographic change on Coccidioides spp. proliferation, dispersion, and coccidioidomycosis infection rates in California. The research focuses on three main aims: 1) investigate the influence of climate variation and dust exposure on the spatiotemporal distribution of cocci incidence using >65,000 geolocated surveillance records from 2000 to 2018 and a case-crossover design; 2) identify environmental sources of C. immitis at high spatial and temporal resolution in disturbed and undisturbed soil, and determine how wind, rainfall, soil disturbance and other factors influence spore dispersion through longitudinal sampling of C. immitis in air and soil; and 3) predict changes in pathogen density over space and time and estimate the exposure-response relationship between pathogen density and risk of infection using a case-crossover approach with prospective surveillance for incident cases. In pursuit of these aims, the research will combine georeferenced coccidioidomycosis case data across California since 2000 at an unprecedented spatial resolution with fine-scale dust concentration estimates and environmental data from a combination of remote sensing, modeling and ground monitors. We will use novel field and laboratory methods to conduct longitudinal sampling of C. immitis in air and soil, determining how microenvironmental conditions and cyclical patterns of rainfall and drought determine pathogen source dynamics, and identifying conditions that support pathogen dispersion through the air. Through these activities, we will identify the specific dust conditions that pose the greatest risk for infection, estimate pathogen exposure and the dose- response relationship, and evaluate heterogeneity in this relationship across risk groups and regions. The results will elucidate drivers of the current epidemic, enhance understanding of the distribution and dispersion of Coccidioides spp. in the environment, and identify high risk regions and subpopulations. The knowledge gained will support decision-makers in targeting, designing and implementing protective measures for vulnerable populations. Project Narrative This project addresses gaps in our understanding of the kinds of dust exposures, and the environmental and social conditions, that increase the incidence of coccidioidomycosis in the southwest. The findings will have wide-ranging benefits for public health, including a better understanding of how people are exposed to the pathogen, the identification of areas and people that are at the highest risk, and predictions of future coccidioidomycosis that can be used to prevent infection in vulnerable groups.",Integrating epidemiologic and environmental approaches to understand and predict Coccidioides exposure and coccidioidomycosis emergence,10065493,R01AI148336,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Air ', ' California ', ' Charge ', ' Climate ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Coccidioides ', ' Coccidioides immitis ', ' C immitis ', ' C. immitis ', ' Coccidioidomycosis ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Droughts ', ' Dust ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' fungus ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Influenza ', ' Grippe ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Meningitis ', ' Meteorology ', ' Methods ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Public Health ', ' Rain ', ' rainfall ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Conditions ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Soil ', ' Reproduction spores ', ' Spores ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Environmental Wind ', ' Wind ', ' Measures ', ' TimeLine ', ' density ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Individual ', ' Crossover Design ', ' Cross-Over Designs ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Prevent infection ', ' Infection prevention ', ' high temperature ', ' High temperature of physical object ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' participatory sensing ', ' remote sensing ', ' novel ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Population Analysis ', ' Resolution ', ' Subgroup ', ' Monitor ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' pathogen exposure ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' pathogen ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Pathogen detection ', ' environmental intervention ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' high risk ', ' Coccidioides posadasii ', ' C posadasii ', ' C. posadasii ', ' temporal measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' Retrospective cohort ', ' Inhalation ', ' Inhaling ', ' Lung infections ', ' pulmonary infections ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' infection risk ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' infection rate ', ' rate of infection ', ' Climatology ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2021,838232,CA-13
"Improving antibiotic treatment decisions through machine learning PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Infections from antibiotic resistant bacteria represent one of the biggest challenges facing modern medical care. Suboptimal antibiotic use is one of the major drivers for antibiotic resistance, however clinicians lack robust tools to help them make rational treatment decisions at the patient-level. The goal of this 3-year mentored clinical scientist research career development program is to apply state-of-the-art machine learning models to routinely collected data in the electronic health record to predict the risk of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) prior to, and after antibiotic treatment. The candidate, Dr. Sanjat Kanjilal, has identified two important clinical problems where improved risk prediction for AMR could have a significant impact on quality of care. The first is the overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics in patients presenting with community-onset sepsis. To address this, the candidate will develop a set of machine learning prediction models trained on routinely collected data in the electronic health record to help clinicians identify which antibiotic(s) will effectively treat the patient's pathogen while being of the narrowest possible spectrum. The second problem is the inability to assess the risk of a patient developing an antibiotic resistant infection after being treated with an antibiotic. The candidate proposes to build a robust causal inference model using targeted maximum likelihood estimation combined with machine learning to estimate the impact of taking various commonly used outpatient antibiotics on the risk of developing a drug resistant infection in the 12 month period after treatment. The results of this work will form the basis of a precision medicine approach to antibiotic stewardship and treatment. The candidate is a practicing infectious diseases clinician and the Associate Medical Director of the clinical microbiology laboratory at the Brigham & Women's Hospital. He has prior experience in building machine learning algorithms that provide robust antimicrobial stewardship. His unique background combined with the rich supporting environment of the Department of Population Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute, position him well for the transition to becoming an independently funded clinician- scientist working at the interface of infectious diseases and machine learning. He has assembled a multidisciplinary mentorship team consisting of experts in sepsis epidemiology, antimicrobial stewardship, implementation science, machine learning and causal inference to help him achieve his goals and has identified a comprehensive training plan that provides him the skills necessary to become a leader in his field. His short term goal is to become an expert in the development of machine learning algorithms that improve decision making for antibiotic resistant infections. His medium term goal is to deploy these models at scale and evaluate their real-world utility with randomized trials. The candidate's long term goal is to use these algorithms and the infrastructure necessary to maintain them as the technologic basis, of a learning health system that provides personalized decision support at the provider and public health level. NARRATIVE Modern medicine is under threat from antibiotic resistant bacteria, which kill more than 35,000 people every year in the United States. This project will apply state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to routinely collected data in the electronic health record to predict the risk of antibiotic resistance for patients presenting with sepsis as well as the risk someone will have a drug- resistant infection after they are treated with an antibiotic. The results of this research will lay the foundation for a data-driven approach to antibiotic treatment that optimizes the needs of the patient with the need to reduce the spread of antibiotic resistant pathogens.",Improving antibiotic treatment decisions through machine learning,10301631,K08HS027841,[''],AHRQ,"HARVARD PILGRIM HEALTH CARE, INC.",K08,2021,149505,MA-07
"Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare-Associated Transmission of Infection Project Summary Despite recent progress in reducing the incidence of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that 687,000 HAIs occurred in U.S. acute care hospitals in 2015 and that the HAI prevalence on a given day was one in 30 patients. An estimated 72,000 patients died with HAIs during their hospitalization. In addition, outbreaks in hospitals remain a serious problem but the vast majority of hospitals use antiquated and ineffective methods to detect them. We established the Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare Acquired Transmission (EDS-HAT) (R01AI127472), which combines bacterial whole genome sequencing (WGS) surveillance (as opposed to reactive WGS) to detect outbreaks with data mining (DM) of the electronic health record (EHR) and machine learning (ML) to identify the responsible transmission routes. We have demonstrated that EDS-HAT detects both serious outbreaks that were otherwise unrecognized and novel transmission routes. Despite this success, additional research is needed to improve upon EDS-HAT and further increase capacity to detect and interrupt hospital outbreaks. For example, hospital outbreaks of respiratory viruses such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2 are well documented, but this area of infection prevention is understudied. The addition of respiratory virus surveillance to EDS-HAT would improve detection and prevention of these costly HAIs. In addition, readily-available clinical microbiology data can be incorporated into EDS-HAT algorithms to reduce reliance on WGS surveillance. Finally, WGS surveillance analysis based entirely on core single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can falsely cluster patients. Therefore, research to investigate the contribution(s) of the accessory genome is necessary to improve discriminatory power of EDS-HAT. In this R01 renewal application, we propose to leverage the success of EDS-HAT by developing additional innovative methods for identification and interruption of hospital-associated transmission. In aim 1, we plan to use WGS surveillance and EHR DM/ML to study hospital transmission of respiratory viruses from retrospective (aim 1a) and prospective collections (aim 1b) of respiratory virus positive specimens at two large academic hospitals (EDS-HAT RV), one for adults and the other pediatric. In aim 2, we will develop advanced analytic methods to create a version of EDS-HAT that relies primarily on DM/ML of the EHR (EDS-HAT Lite) (aim 2a) and improve the discriminatory power of WGS to correctly classify patients who are part of an outbreak (aim 2b). EDS-HAT RV and EDS-HAT Lite will undergo clinical and budget impact analyses to determine the number of cases prevented and healthcare costs averted. These aims will be accomplished by a team with expertise in infectious diseases epidemiology, outbreak investigation, infection prevention, microbial genomics and genomic epidemiology, machine learning and data mining, and economic analysis and modeling. Our proposed research will lead to improved patient safety and can serve as a model for how outbreaks are detected and interrupted in hospitals. Project narrative We have demonstrated that the Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare Association Transmission (EDS- HAT) detects serious outbreaks that are otherwise unidentified. In this renewal application, we propose to leverage the success of EDS-HAT by adding respiratory viral infections, developing an outbreak detection system that does not rely primarily on whole genome sequencing, and developing advanced genomic analytic tools for improved detection.

"Living in the post-Zika world: Impact of interactions between dengue and Zika viruses on diagnostics, antibody dynamics, and correlates of disease risk SUMMARY Worldwide, over 3 billion people are at risk of infection and disease caused by dengue virus 1-4 (DENV1-4) and Zika virus (ZIKV), both potentially severe flaviviral diseases transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. The devastating effects of endemic dengue across the tropics and subtropics are well documented. The recent Zika pandemic galvanized research as Zika swept across Latin America. Three years after the peak of the Zika pandemic, major dengue epidemics have started to re-occur; however, the future of flaviviral disease across areas with widespread ZIKV immunity is unknown. In this R01, we propose to develop new tools and address key knowledge gaps in flaviviral transmission and immunological interactions between DENV and ZIKV to understand how widespread ZIKV immunity impacts subsequent dengue disease and to inform evaluation of dengue and Zika clinical vaccine trials and post-licensure studies. Based on our serological, epidemiological, and clinical data to date, our overall hypothesis is that DENV1-4 and ZIKV are antigenically closely related and that immune interactions mutually affect transmission and disease severity. We will address this hypothesis with the ongoing Pediatric Dengue Cohort Study (PDCS, 2004-present), a community-based prospective cohort study in Managua, Nicaragua, following ~4,000 children, now in its 17th year. Samples from the PDCS, as well as companion studies in Managua, provide documented infection and disease data, as well as banked serum samples for over a decade before the arrival of ZIKV. The proposed study extends the cohort, ensuring that we are able to fully document the interactions of these viruses from the pre- to post-Zika eras. In Aim 1, we will develop innovative serologic tools based on glycan-fusion-loop-masked envelope proteins and new algorithms to distinguish DENV and ZIKV infection histories, critical for vaccination and epidemiological studies of dengue and Zika. We will then test our hypothesis that pre-existing ZIKV immunity can enhance disease severity caused by DENV3 but protect against DENV1. In Aim 2, we will measure changes in anti-DENV and anti-ZIKV antibody-mediated immunity over time, estimate annual changes in protective and enhancing population immunity to each virus, collect entomological data, and use modeling approaches to evaluate popula- tion susceptibility to DENV and ZIKV infection and the potential for future epidemics by incorporating immunolo- gical and entomological data. In Aim 3, we will identify determinants of protective and disease-enhancing anti- body-mediated immunity of prior DENV infection on Zika and prior ZIKV infection on dengue disease and severity. With support of expert collaborators, we will use state-of-the-art tools (e.g., new monoclonal antibodies, innovative flavivirus antigens, and antibody Fc profiling) to analyze specific infection histories and uncover potential immune correlates. Overall, this program will define new vaccine companion diagnostic assays, the dynamics of the antibody response to DENV and ZIKV, and correlates of protection and pathogenesis for dengue and Zika, which should be useful for the development and evaluation of dengue and Zika vaccines. NARRATIVE Dengue and Zika are diseases of major importance worldwide, but surveillance, epidemic preparedness, and control are complicated by immunological cross-reactivity between dengue and Zika viruses (DENV and ZIKV), particularly in dengue-endemic Latin America after the explosive 2015-2016 Zika pandemic. It is critical for dengue and Zika vaccine evaluation and implementation, epidemic preparedness, and public health research to improve differential detection of prior infections by DENV and ZIKV and increase our understanding of how immunological cross-reactivity affects serological testing, seroprevalence estimation, viral transmission, and protection and/or enhancement of future flaviviral disease. Following upon our recent work showing that immunological asymmetries exist among the four DENV serotypes and ZIKV and that pre-existing immunity to ZIKV can enhance subsequent DENV2 infection and disease, this R01 will use new serological assays, diverse modeling approaches, and state-of-the-art methods for antibody analysis to study samples and data from the longest-running dengue/Zika cohort study and extend this unique Nicaraguan cohort into the next critical phase of flaviviral disease in the tropics and subtropics where infection and disease outcomes are modulated by widespread ZIKV immunity.","Living in the post-Zika world: Impact of interactions between dengue and Zika viruses on diagnostics, antibody dynamics, and correlates of disease risk",10297285,U01AI153416,"['Aedes ', '

"Using three-dimensional protein networks to uncover immuno-modulatory molecular phenotypes in infectious disease Using three-dimensional protein networks to uncover immuno-modulatory molecular phenotypes in  infectious disease CHALLENGE: Over the past decade, technologies for deep profiling of the human immune system, both in the context of natural and vaccine-mediated immunity, have become readily available. These approaches have generated a wide range of molecular profiles across infectious disease contexts. However, existing studies primarily focus on individual `omic datasets, and do not take into account the underlying molecular networks. Thus, the primary emphasis has been on uncovering predictive biomarkers, but these biomarkers may often be correlative surrogates and have little or no connection with the underlying molecular phenotypes driving disease pathophysiology. GOAL I propose to develop and use a novel framework to integrate genomic data with three-dimensional (3D) structurally-resolved protein networks to uncover immuno-modulatory molecular phenotypes in infectious disease. While protein networks are typically viewed as two-dimensional, with proteins as nodes and interactions between them as edges, this simplifying representation fails to take into account the 3D structures of the proteins themselves, and the corresponding interaction interfaces. My past work has demonstrated the critical importance of taking into account corresponding structural information in the integration of Mendelian mutations with protein networks, to elucidate molecular phenotypes underlying the corresponding genetic disorders, with high sensitivity and specificity. Here, I propose to develop a novel framework that integrates structural genomic data with host-pathogen protein interactome networks to generate 3D host-pathogen interactomes. These 3D interactome networks are then integrated with host (human) genetic data to uncover immuno-modulatory molecular phenotypes in HIV and influenza. INNOVATION AND IMPACT: The proposed work integrates both two orthogonal facets of my expertise in network systems biology and machine learning, and pushes the envelope on multiple key frontiers. First, it provides a novel framework for the integration of host genetic data with host-pathogen protein networks. Second, a key novelty is the incorporation of structural information corresponding to host-pathogen protein interaction interfaces to refine the traditional principle of “guilt-by-association”, and hone in on specific molecular phenotypes that modulate infectious disease risk. The identified molecular phenotypes will generate key mechanistic hypotheses regarding corresponding disease pathophysiology, and help design interventional strategies. Finally, while the focus here is to use this approach in HIV and influenza, the framework itself is generalizable and can be used across infectious disease contexts. Project Narrative I propose to develop and use a novel framework to integrate host genetic data with three-dimensional structurally-resolved host-pathogen protein networks to uncover immuno-modulatory molecular phenotypes in infectious disease. The incorporation of structural information provides a significant refinement over the traditional principle of “guilt-by-association”, and allows us to hone in on specific molecular phenotypes that modulate infectious disease risk. While the focus of the proposal is to use this approach to infectious diseases, the framework itself is generalizable and can be used across other immunological disease contexts.",Using three-dimensional protein networks to uncover immuno-modulatory molecular phenotypes in infectious disease,10295268,DP2AI164325,"['Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Goals ', ' Guilt ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Immunity ', ' Immune System Diseases ', ' Immune Diseases ', ' Immune Disorders ', ' Immune Dysfunction ', ' Immune System Disorder ', ' Immune System Dysfunction ', ' Immune System and Related Disorders ', ' Immunodeficiency and Immunosuppression Disorders ', ' Immunologic Diseases ', ' Immunological Diseases ', ' Immunological Dysfunction ', ' Immunological System Dysfunction ', ' Influenza ', ' Grippe ', ' Malaria ', ' Paludism ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Modernization ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Phenotype ', ' Proteins ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Vaccines ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Viral Proteins ', ' Viral Gene Products ', ' Viral Gene Proteins ', ' virus protein ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Penetrance ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' Immunomodulation ', ' immune modulation ', ' immune regulation ', ' immunologic reactivity control ', ' immunomodulatory ', ' immunoregulatory ', ' immunoregulation ', ' novel ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' HIV risk ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' Anti-Viral Response ', ' Antiviral Response ', ' structural genomics ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Homology Modeling ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' molecular profile ', ' molecular signature ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Resolution ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' 3-D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3D structure ', ' pathogen ', ' frontier ', ' flu ', ' two-dimensional ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' comparative ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' molecular phenotype ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' predictive marker ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' genomic variation ', ' Mendelian disorder ', ' Mendelian disease ', ' Mendelian genetic disorder ', ' monogenic disease ', ' monogenic disorder ', ' single-gene disease ', ' single-gene disorder ', ' HIV/TB ', ' HIV/Mtb ', ' HIV/mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' HIV/tuberculosis ', ' M. tuberculosis/HIV ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' Structural Protein ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' genetic condition ', ' genetic disorder ', ' genomic locus ', ' gene locus ', ' genetic locus ', ' protein data bank ', ' protein databank ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,DP2,2021,470125,PA-18
"Host Proteomic Biosignatures for a Urine-based Diagnosis of Pulmonary Tuberculosis in Children PROJECT ABSTRACT Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of mortality in children worldwide. Difficulty in obtaining sputum and a low sputum bacillary load are major barriers to diagnosis, and necessitate the development of a non-sputum, biomarker-based assay for childhood intrathoracic TB disease. Host biomarker discovery for childhood TB requires a greater focus on downstream proteins and their post-translational modifications (PTMs) that are more likely to be specific to a disease phenotype and can be more easily translated into a point-of-care test. With the support of this K23 award, Dr. Devan Jaganath will identify a host proteomic biosignature in urine that can achieve the goal accuracy for a triage and/or diagnostic test for pulmonary TB in children. To complete this objective, he will leverage an ongoing prospective cohort of symptomatic children being evaluated for intrathoracic TB in Kampala, Uganda, with the extensive proteomic facilities available at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). In Aim 1, he will perform targeted mass spectrometry on urine samples from children with confirmed vs. unlikely TB, and examine the abundance and ubiquitylation of 10 host proteins that have prior evidence of specific interactions with M. tuberculosis (Mtb) proteins as candidate biomarkers. In Aim 2, he will use shotgun mass spectrometry on the urine samples to identify all host proteins and their PTMs that can differentiate TB status as novel biomarkers, and perform pathway analysis to determine the subset with functional relevance to Mtb pathogenesis. In Aim 3, he will apply machine learning analyses to identify the smallest combination of biomarkers that can achieve the target accuracy thresholds for a triage and/or diagnostic test for intrathoracic TB disease. He will then evaluate the performance of promising biosignatures in an independent, prospectively enrolled test set. Through this approach, Dr. Jaganath seeks to optimize biomarker discovery for childhood TB diagnosis by coupling prospective clinical cohorts with a targeted and untargeted high-throughput approach to comprehensively examine non-sputum samples for host biomarkers for children. Dr. Jaganath's career goal is to be a physician scientist who translates non-sputum biomarkers into clinical tools that can improve the care of children with TB. To support his path to independence, the proposed work will be paired with a dedicated, multidisciplinary mentorship team and training in international pediatric TB biomarker studies, bioinformatics for proteomic analysis, and machine learning. UCSF is an outstanding environment that is committed to junior investigators with extensive resources for research and career development, and Mulago National Referral Hospital in Uganda is a leader in pediatric TB research, and has the established infrastructure for ongoing enrollment and sample collection. The findings will support an NIH R01 application to validate the biomarkers and biosignatures in large, diverse cohorts in comparison to existing non-sputum diagnostics. Thus, the K23 award will provide Dr. Jaganath with the critical mentorship, training, resources and experience to become an independent investigator who can make important contributions to the field of childhood TB. PROJECT NARRATIVE More than half of the estimated tuberculosis (TB) disease cases in children worldwide have not been reported to the health system, and 96% of pediatric TB deaths are in children not started on treatment. The proposed project seeks to address the key barriers in diagnosing pulmonary TB in children through discovery of a host proteomic biosignature in urine. The findings will be relevant to the public health efforts to reduce the burden of TB in children and will support the development of a non-invasive, non-sputum based assay for childhood TB disease at the point-of-care.",Host Proteomic Biosignatures for a Urine-based Diagnosis of Pulmonary Tuberculosis in Children,10248492,K23HL153581,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' California ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Child Care ', ' Puericulture ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Hospital Referrals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunoassay ', ' Infection ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' mortality ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' M tb ', ' M tuberculosis ', ' M. tb ', ' M. tuberculosis ', ' mtb ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nested Case-Control Study ', ' Physicians ', ' Post-Translational Protein Processing ', ' Post-Translational Modification Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Post-Translational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Protein Modification ', ' Posttranslational Modifications ', ' Posttranslational Protein Processing ', ' Protein Modification ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' San Francisco ', ' Shotguns ', ' shot gun ', ' Specificity ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Sputum ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Triage ', ' Tuberculosis ', ' M tuberculosis infection ', ' M. tb infection ', ' M. tuberculosis infection ', ' M.tb infection ', ' M.tuberculosis infection ', ' MTB infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection ', ' TB infection ', ' disseminated TB ', ' disseminated tuberculosis ', ' infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' tuberculosis infection ', ' tuberculous spondyloarthropathy ', ' Pulmonary Tuberculosis ', ' Lung TB ', ' Lung Tuberculosis ', ' Pulmonary TB ', ' Uganda ', ' Universities ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Funding ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Scientist ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Reporting ', ' Proteome ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' Proteomics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Diagnostic Sensitivity ', ' International ', ' K23 Award ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Program ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' point of care ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' Expression Signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' gene expression signature ', ' transcriptional profile ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' disease phenotype ', ' prospective ', ' Coupling ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' candidate marker ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' novel marker ', ' new marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' biosignature ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' biomarker panel ', ' marker panel ', ' biomarker discovery ', ' protein biomarkers ', ' protein markers ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' Infrastructure ', ' point of care testing ', ' ']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2021,210600,CA-12
"Automated Surveillance of Postoperative Infections (ASPIN) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Our long term goal is to reduce postoperative infections. We will start by developing a system to accurately and completely identify their occurrence by applying machine learning algorithms to electronic health record (EHR) data. We will utilize a comprehensive audit and feedback system to create reports of risk-adjusted rates and specific details of postoperative infectious complications that are shared with surgeons and other healthcare providers to facilitate their awareness. We call this system the Automated Surveillance of Postoperative Infections (ASPIN). ASPIN will be piloted in the four major hospitals of the University of Colorado Health system (UCHealth) with a combined surgical volume of approximately 80,000 patients per year. We expect this will supersede the costly and laborious manual partial sampling of postoperative infectious complications which is current utilized by many hospitals. Specific Aim 1. Expand and enhance models for preoperative risk prediction and postoperative identification of surgical infections using EHR and ACS NSQIP data from patients who underwent operations at four UCHealth hospitals.  Specific Aim 1a) Enhance previously-developed models for identification of postoperative infections by controlling Type-I errors via “knockoffs,” a recent statistical innovation for high dimensional model selection using false discovery rate correction. Specific Aim 1b) Deploy natural language processing methods using EHR text reports of these patients to identify additional indicators of postoperative infections and further refine the models. Specific Aim 1c) Create preoperative risk models for infection using EHR data - similar to the models  implemented in the AHRQ-funded Surgical Risk Preoperative Assessment System - but that do not require  additional data entry by the health care providers. Specific Aim 2. From the beginning of the study, develop ASPIN with input from an Advisory Committee composed of administrators and surgeons from all four UCHealth hospitals. Additional feedback from surgeons will be obtained through focus groups and semi-structured interviews at several steps of ASPIN development and implementation planning. Specific Aim 3. A pilot implementation of ASPIN will utilize the RE-AIM framework to guide and examine the preliminary effectiveness and feasibility of ASPIN at UCHealth. We will recruit 30 surgeon participants from all four UCHealth hospitals to use ASPIN, and we will evaluate the reach, effectiveness, adoption, and implementation of ASPIN.  This research responds to AHRQ priorities by utilizing existing data to develop a learning health system with a distinct focus on improving surveillance and reporting of postoperative healthcare-associated infections. PROJECT NARRATIVE Infectious complications of surgery (surgical site infection, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and sepsis) are common, occurring in about 8% of major surgical procedures, and are costly. Currently used surveillance techniques require extensive human participation, resulting in delays of at least six months before the data are available to care providers, and the data represent only a small sample of all operations. We propose to develop a machine learning-based, near real-time recurring audit and feedback system for identification of postoperative infections that will inform providers about infectious outcomes of their patients.",Automated Surveillance of Postoperative Infections (ASPIN),10254332,R01HS027417,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2021,395050,CO-06
"Impact of chronic ethanol consumption on lung functional and immunological landscape and implication for susceptibility to SARSCoV2 infection PROJECT SUMMARY As of the submission of this proposal, over 38 million cases of COVID-19 including a million deaths have been reported worldwide. COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that can range from a mild to a severe/fatal disease characterized by excessive lung inflammation, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), coagulopathy, and multi-organ failure. Current studies suggest a major role for myeloid cell subsets in the development and exacerbation of disease, but the precise roles of lung-resident macrophages and infiltrating monocytes in COVID-19 pathogenesis remains poorly understood. It is already well-established that chronic heavy alcohol drinking (CHD) is a significant risk factor for developing ARDS and admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) for patients with pneumonia. CHD is also associated with increased susceptibility to both bacterial and viral pulmonary infections, notably respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), community-acquired pneumonia, and tuberculosis. Defects in epithelial barrier as well as anti-microbial functions of alveolar macrophage are believed to be major causes for increased vulnerability to respiratory diseases in individuals with CHD. Despite the clear association between CHD and increased risk of severe pulmonary infections, no studies to date have examined the impact of CHD on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. In this application, we propose to test the hypothesis that chronic alcohol drinking alters lung-resident myeloid cells leading to exacerbated inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 with reduced viral clearance. To test this hypothesis, we will leverage a rhesus macaque model of voluntary ethanol self- administration that accurately mirrors human physiology and recapitulates complex human drinking behavior. Using this model, we recently demonstrated that CHD results in transcriptional and epigenetic rewiring of circulating monocytes and splenic macrophages, resulting in aberrant inflammatory responses. Additional preliminary studies show enhanced production of inflammatory factors with reduced type I IFN response to RSV infection as well as decreased phagocytic capacity of alveolar macrophages in CHD animals. We will first examine the impact of CHD on the phenotypic, functional and transcriptional landscape of lung-resident immune cells. Then, we will examine the impact of CHD on the response of lung-resident immune cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Completion of these experiments will allow us to define CHD-mediated differences in the lung immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection that modulate COVID19 disease progression and severity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, can result in severe lung pathologies and inflammatory cytokine storms in individuals with underlying health conditions. Chronic heavy alcohol use and misuse increases risk for several lung infection, but whether CHD is a risk factor for COVID-19 disease remains unknown. The proposed research aims to identify the impact of chronic alcohol consumption on immune response to SARS-CoV-2.",Impact of chronic ethanol consumption on lung functional and immunological landscape

"Investigating virus-host interactions with prime editing and genetic code expansion PROJECT SUMMARY Host proteins play essential roles in the replication of all viruses. This represents a vulnerability that could potentially be exploited to develop interventions against viruses currently circulating in humans as well as new and emerging viral threats. However, realizing this potential requires mechanistic understanding of how specific host factors function during viral infection. This proposal will develop a versatile screening methodology to investigate the mechanisms through which host proteins enhance virus replication. This will be achieved using recent developments in genome engineering and chemical biology that enable site-specific modification of host factors with unnatural amino acids. By genetically re-coding >100 host proteins implicated in the replication of influenza A virus (IAV), we will investigate (1) the effects of depleting specific host factors on virus replication and the subcellular localization of viral proteins; (2) the effects of viral infection on the expression and subcellular localization of host proteins; and (3) the effects of host factor depletion on the assembly and morphogenesis of new virus particles. If successful, this project will provide insight into the host dependency of IAV and establish a resource for investigating host protein function in the replication of additional, evolutionarily-divergent respiratory viruses. PROJECT NARRATIVE Therapeutic interventions that can prevent or control emerging viral infections are urgently needed.

"Serological markers of natural immunity to Plasmodium falciparum infection PROJECT SUMMARY Plasmodium falciparum is the most common and deadly cause of malaria. An effective malaria vaccine has the potential to make a pivotal change in malaria control and eradication. For a vaccine to contribute significantly to malaria eradication, it must target the early, pre-erythrocytic part of the lifecycle to block both symptomatic disease and asymptomatic infection, which perpetuates transmission. Naturally acquired immunity to pre- erythrocytic infection is acquired with exposure but remains poorly understood and continues to impede vaccine efforts. DeAnna Friedman-Klabanoff, M.D., a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, developed this career development award proposal to use novel high-throughput tools to define naturally acquired humoral immunity to diverse pre-erythrocytic epitopes associated with protection, which could lead to novel vaccine candidates. Dr. Friedman-Klabanoff’s long-term goal is to become an independent clinical and translational researcher dedicated to the development of a malaria vaccine, applying immunology and data science to inform and optimize vaccine development. To gain the skills necessary to achieve this goal, Dr. Friedman-Klabanoff proposes a career development plan that includes mentoring from Drs. Miriam Laufer, Shannon Takala Harrison, Michael Cummings, Andrea Berry, Kathleen Neuzil, and John Adams, leaders in the fields of international research design and leadership, molecular epidemiology, data science for analysis of large data sets, use of peptide microarrays to study malaria, vaccinology, and in vitro models of pre-erythrocytic immunity. This project will utilize samples and data from a cohort study of malaria in Malawi led by Dr. Laufer, the primary mentor for this proposal. Household members were followed monthly for detection of malaria infection and mosquitoes were collected from the houses to identify bloodmeal sources. Bloodmeal sources will be identified by matching the human DNA found in the mosquito bloodmeals to DNA from enrolled participants . Mosquito salivary glands will also be tested for P. falciparum infection to determine if the mosquitoes were infectious. Children will be defined as protected or infected based on whether they develop blood-stage infection during the month after an infectious bite. Aim 1 of this proposal will be to identify serologic responses associated with natural protection against P. falciparum infection after exposure to an infectious bite. Serum from the day of exposure will be probed on a custom-developed peptide microarray designed from diverse, field-derived sequences to characterize pre-exposure immunity to pre-erythrocytic antigens. Aim 2 of this proposal is to assess the functional role of antibodies targeting P. falciparum pre-erythrocytic antigens of interest. B- and T- cell epitope prediction tools will be used to find predicted epitopes in pre-erythrocytic proteins and their variants, and in vitro liver models will be used to assess the functional role of antibodies to these epitopes to validate and down select the potential epitopes. The practical implications of this work will be to identify promising epitopes that are targets of protective immunity. PROJECT NARRATIVE Plasmodium falciparum, the most common species of malaria, kills more children than any other pathogen, and the development of a highly effective vaccine has been challenging. Children acquire immunity to malaria with repeated exposure, but the mechanism is poorly understood. We will collect samples from children who are exposed to Plasmodium-infected mosquito bites and compare the immune responses among those who develop infection to those who do not to identify possible targets for vaccines to prevent malaria infection.",Serological markers of natural immunity to Plasmodium falciparum infection,10301258,K23AI155838,"['Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Anopheles Genus ',

"Decoding tobacco-related oral cancer ecosystem by integrative approach PROJECT SUMMARY Known risk factors for oral cancers are tobacco and alcohol use and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. There is a clear interaction between tobacco use and HPV infection. Smokers have a significantly higher rate of persistent oral HPV infection which is a significant risk factor to develop oral cancer. Patients with tobacco- related oral cancers have poor prognosis. Apart from the obvious damage tobacco causes to genomic DNA, cigarette smoke exposure also significantly impacts the immune system. Recently immunotherapy has become a promising therapeutic option in oral cancer. Programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) is one of the clinically significant checkpoint molecules that have been shown to suppress T-cell function upon binding to its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. Nivolumab and pembrolizumab are the two PD-1 inhibitors with the most efficacy and safety data in management of oral cancer. While the detrimental effects of continued tobacco use have been established over the years, the effects of tobacco use in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and immunotherapy efficacy in oral cancers are poorly investigated. In this proposal, we will comprehensively evaluate the tobacco-related effects on the oral cancer ecosystem through integrated multi-omics approaches, identify novel therapeutic agents leveraging the oral cancer-specific TIME, and develop an oral cancer specific web portal to advance the field in tobacco-related cancer research.

"Ancient viral threats through the lens of adaptation in human genomes Project Summary The current SARS-COV2 pandemic has brought to light that more efforts are needed to evaluate the pandemic potential of viruses that can spill over in human populations. To assess the pandemic potential of specific viruses, over the next five years my lab will ask if similar viruses caused epidemics not only during the recent documented past, but during the much longer time scale of human evolution. Viruses that caused epidemics in the past are indeed the most likely to cause epidemics again in the future, and hundreds of viral epidemics likely plagued human populations during their evolution. This work will fill gaps in knowledge on epidemics in ancestral human populations, and by doing so, will enable a better assessment of the viruses that represent a future pandemic threat.  To study ancient epidemics, my lab will exploit host genomic adaptation driven by ancient viruses. Arms races with viruses have shaped the host immune system by driving a large number of adaptations. I recently showed that viruses left abundant signals of adaptation not only in immune genes, but across the entire human genome. The lab will examine signals of adaptation left by specific viruses in human genomes, to detect, date, and functionally characterize ancient epidemics. To this aim, we will develop new statistical tools based on recent advances in machine learning and in the reconstruction of Ancestral Recombination Graphs (ARGs). These new approaches with increased power to detect and date genomic adaptation will allow us to ask the following questions: 1) Which viruses drove ancient epidemics in human evolution? My lab will create deep learning tests with high power to detect complex genomic adaptation within the past ~200,000 years of human evolution. 2) When did specific viruses drive ancient epidemics? We will use ARGs and Approximate Bayesian Computation to date ancient epidemics, by dating the host adaptive events driven by specific viruses. 3) Which functional host genetic changes were selected during ancient epidemics, in which genes, and how do they influence genetic susceptibility to present viruses? We will investigate regulatory adaptation to viruses and the overall impact of virus-driven host adaptation on the genetic susceptibility of different human populations to specific present viruses, thereby providing virologists with strong candidate host genes for further inquiry.  My lab is uniquely suited to decipher ancient epidemics by linking host-pathogen interactions together with the latest developments in the population genomics of adaptation. Project narrative Arms races with viruses have shaped human genomic adaptation, not only in immune genes, but also across the entire human genome. Over the coming years, my lab will exploit host genomic adaptation to detect, date, and functionally characterize ancient viral epidemics that plagued ancestral human populations. Because past viral threats are more likely to become threats again in the future, ancient epidemics will provide a better assessment of the viruses with the potential to cause future epidemics.",Ancient viral threats through the lens of adaptation in human genomes,10274677,R35GM142677,"['Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Epidemic ', ' Evolution ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Genetic Recombination ', ' DNA Recombination ', ' Recombination ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Virus ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' Left ', ' Link ', ' Bayesian Analysis ', ' Bayesian computation ', ' Bayesian inference ', ' Bayesian network analysis ', ' Bayesian spatial analysis ', ' Bayesian statistical analysis ', ' Bayesian statistical inference ', ' Bayesian statistics ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' genetic etiology ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Viral ', ' Graph ', ' Genomics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' pandemic disease ', ' pandemic ', ' reconstruction ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' pathogen ', ' Population ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' arm ', ' deep learning ', ' COVID-19 pandemic ', ' COVID crisis ', ' COVID epidemic ', ' COVID pandemic ', ' COVID-19 crisis ', ' COVID-19 epidemic ', ' COVID-19 global health crisis ', ' COVID-19 global pandemic ', ' COVID-19 health crisis ', ' COVID-19 public health crisis ', ' COVID19 crisis ', ' COVID19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 global health crisis ', ' COVID19 global pandemic ', ' COVID19 health crisis ', ' COVID19 pandemic ', ' COVID19 public health crisis ', ' SARS-CoV-2 epidemic ', ' SARS-CoV-2 global health crisis ', ' SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic ', ' SARS-CoV-2 pandemic ', ' SARS-CoV2 epidemic ', ' SARS-CoV2 pandemic ', ' SARS-coronavirus-2 epidemic ', ' SARS-coronavirus-2 pandemic ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 epidemic ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 pandemic ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 epidemic ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 crisis ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 global health crisis ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 global pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 health crisis ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 public health crisis ', ' coronavirus disease crisis ', ' coronavirus disease epidemic ', ' coronavirus disease pandemic ', ' severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 global health crisis ', ' severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 global pandemic ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R35,2021,377363,AZ-03
"Coordinating Research on Emerging Arboviral Threats Encoing the Neotropics (CREATE-NEO) Project Summary In recent decades, Central and South America have experienced spillover of endemic arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) from wildlife reservoirs into humans, exchange and recombination of emerging arboviruses within the region, resurgence of arboviruses previously controlled by vaccination or vector control, introduction and spread of novel arboviruses, and exportation of viruses to other regions. Furthermore, there is great concern that newly-introduced Zika virus may spill back into an enzootic transmission cycle in the Americas. Central and South America encompass enormous vertebrate and invertebrate biodiversity, and these species harbor a broad range of arboviruses whose risk of spillover and spread in humans is presently unknown. Increases in the rates of global travel, invasion of novel vector species, urban expansion, deforestation, and global climate change all elevate the risk of further arbovirus emergence, as does the breakdown of public health structures in Venezuela.  The Coordinating Research on Emerging Arboviral Threats Encompassing the Neotropics (CREATE- NEO) project will provide a network of surveillance sites in the neotropics coupled to cutting-edge modeling approaches in order to anticipate and counter emerging arboviruses. Aim 1 will identify novel and known arboviruses as well as the host-vector networks that sustain transmission of these viruses within the neotropics, map the spatial distribution of these transmission networks, and characterize virus transmission dynamics within these networks. To do so, we will collect mosquitoes and other vectors as well as non-human primates and other vertebrate hosts at multiple sites in areas of high and varied biodiversity in Panama and Brazil and screen these samples for known and novel arboviruses. These data will then be analyzed using niche modeling, machine learning to predict undiscovered hosts and vectors, and dynamical transmission models. Aim 2 will focus on prospective and retrospective analysis of human infection and disease. To do so, we will leverage ongoing human clinical cohorts at multiple sites in Brazil and Panama. We will extend and expand these cohorts, with a particular focus on the immune-mediated interactions among multiple arboviruses at sites of hyperendemicity. We will also develop novel diagnostics to capture known and novel arboviruses and model the impact of human and non-human primate movement on spillover and spillback of target arboviruses.  Data and models generated via these two aims will forewarn local, regional and global public health agencies of arboviruses within Central and South America that pose particularly high risk of spillover, emergence into transmission among humans, and/or international spread. Moreover CREATE-NEO will build local capacity to predict, detect and respond to emerging arboviruses at their point of origin, thereby maximizing the potential to avert full-blown emergence. Project Narrative Arthropod-borne viruses, such as dengue, Zika and Mayaro, are emerging at an accelerating rate in Central and South America. The Coordinating Research on Emerging Arboviral Threats Encompassing the Neotropics (CREATE-NEO) project will provide a nimble and flexible network of surveillance sites in Central and South America coupled to cutting-edge modeling approaches in order to anticipate and counter these threats to public health.",Coordinating Research on Emerging Arboviral Threats Encoing the Neotropics (CREATE-NEO),10170251,U01AI151807,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Americas ', ' Animals ', ' Arbovirus Infections ', ' Arboviral infections ', ' Arthropod-Born Viral Infection ', ' arboviral disease ', ' arbovirus disease ', ' arthropod-borne disease ', ' arthropod-borne infection ', ' arthropodborne disease ', ' arthropodborne infection ', ' Arboviruses ', ' Arboviral ', ' Arthropod-Borne Viruses ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Circulation ', ' Brazil ', ' Central America ', ' chikungunya ', ' Chikungunya virus ', ' CHIKV ', ' Cities ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Dengue ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay ', ' ELISA ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infection ', ' Invertebrates ', ' Invertebrata ', ' Malaria ', ' Paludism ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Maps ', ' Measles ', ' Rubeola ', ' morbilli ', ' Culicidae ', ' Mosquitoes ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Panama ', ' Public Health ', ' Genetic Recombination ', ' DNA Recombination ', ' Recombination ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' South America ', ' Spatial Distribution ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Vaccination ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Venezuela ', ' Virus ', ' West Nile virus ', ' Egypt 101 virus ', ' WNV ', ' West Nile ', ' Yellow Fever ', ' Zoonoses ', ' Zoonotic ', ' Zoonotic Infection ', ' Deforestation ', ' forest clearing ', ' Mediating ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' insight ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' Biodiversity ', ' Biological Diversity ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequencies ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Route ', ' experience ', ' enzootic ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Habitats ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' International ', ' Collection ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Vector-transmitted infectious disease ', ' Vector-borne disease ', ' Vector-borne infectious disease ', ' Vector-transmitted disease ', ' vector-borne illness ', ' vectorborne disease ', ' vectorborne illness ', ' vectorborne infectious disease ', ' vector control ', ' vector ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' climate change ', ' global climate change ', ' pathogen ', ' prospective ', ' Coupled ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' high risk ', ' surveillance network ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' nanobodies ', ' nanobody ', ' sdAb ', ' single domain antibodies ', ' seroconversion ', ' Zika Virus ', ' ZIKV ', ' zikav ', ' viral transmission ', ' virus transmission ', ' ZIKA ', ' diagnostic technologies ', ' emerging pathogen ', ' new pathogen ', ' novel pathogen ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,U01,2021,1519214,TX-14
"Successful Clinical Response In Pneumonia Therapy (SCRIPT) Systems Biology Center Modified Project Summary/Abstract Section  This innovative integrated systems biology application seeks to delineate the complex host/pathogen interactions occurring at the alveolar level that lead to unsuccessful response to therapy in serious pneumonia, including serious viral pneumonia. To achieve this objective, we will leverage our unique access to alveolar fluid collected as part of routine clinical care in mechanically ventilated patients with suspected pneumonia in our medical intensive care unit. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid will be obtained serially from well characterized mechanically ventilated patients with serious viral or Pseudomonas or Acinetobacter bacterial pneumonias. Both of these CDC-designated serious hazard level bacterial pathogens have clinical failure rates as high as 50%. A robust clinical definition will allow comparison of both host and pathogen signatures associated with failure of therapy vs. success. These clinical specimens and extensive patient phenomics will anchor two mutually supportive and iterative research projects. Project One will deploy robust tools for flow sorting macrophage and lymphocyte subset populations, isolating RNA from these populations, and performing transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis to compare successful and unsuccessful host response. Project Two will focus on both specific pathogen genomic profiles associated with unsuccessful outcome and the differential microbiome response. Specific pathogen genomic profiles identified will be tested for causality in a unique humanized alveolar macrophage mouse model by the Technology Core. Changes in microbiome communities will be comprehensively assessed by shotgun deep sequencing to detect bacteriophage, other virus, and fungal DNA, in addition to bacterial. A Technical Core will perform cell sorting of BAL macrophage and lymphocyte subsets, RNA sequencing, and whole genome methylation, as well as perform the mouse pneumonia model studies. A Data Management and Bioinformatics Core will develop tools to reduce the dimensionality of these large comprehensive datasets, including the clinical phenomics, and provide them to the Modeling Core. The Modeling Core will then use an ecosystem-based approach to this complex adaptive system combined with unique machine learning tools and neural networks to generate biomarkers of host, pathogen and/or microbiome patterns predictive of successful pneumonia outcome.

"Influenza host specific glycan motif identification through systems biology Project Summary Influenza A viruses (IAVs) have caused large losses of life around the world and continue to present a great public health challenge. IAVs can cause infections in birds, sea mammals, lower mammals (e.g., pigs, dogs, and horses), and humans. Previous studies have demonstrated that the structures of the carbohydrate receptors determine influenza host and tissue tropisms. Thus, it is necessary to understand the receptor- binding properties for IAVs and monitor changes to them, especially for IAVs at the animal–human interface. However, this understanding is hampered by our lack of detailed knowledge of IAV glycan substructures; most of our knowledge is limited to SA2,3Gal-like and SA2,6Gal-like structures. The goals of this project are to develop and validate a machine learning method to identify host-specific glycan substructures for IAVs by using glycan array data and to identify and validate the glycan motifs associated with the host tropisms of IAVs, including those for zoonotic IAVs. The study will focus on natural hosts of IAVs: humans, swine, canines, equines, and various avian species, including common domestic poultry species and wild bird species. We expect to identify structural determinants for receptor binding with human-, swine-, canine-, and avian-origin IAVs. Such knowledge will help us understand the factors that contribute to influenza infection and transmission and thereby facilitate development of an effective influenza vaccine to prevent virus infection and block virus transmission. This knowledge will also help us develop rapid assays for monitoring emerging influenza threats at the animal–human interface. We also expect to develop a computational method for identifying glycan motifs associated with influenza host tropisms; this method will be able to be adapted to determine functional glycan motifs for other proteins, lectins, antibodies, antisera, and microorganisms, including those of other infectious pathogens, by using glycan arrays. Project Narrative This project will develop and apply a computational tool to identify glycan motifs associated with influenza host tropisms, and the derived knowledge will help us develop effective strategies for influenza prevention and control.",Influenza host specific glycan motif identification through systems biology,10092924,R21AI144433,"['Affect ', ' Animals ', ' Antibodies ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Birds ', ' Aves ', ' Avian ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Canis familiaris ', ' Canine Species ', ' Dogs ', ' Dogs Mammals ', ' canine ', ' domestic dog ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Hemagglutinin ', ' Equus caballus ', ' Domestic Horse ', ' Equine ', ' Equine Species ', ' Equus przewalskii ', ' Horses ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immune Sera ', ' Antisera ', ' immune serum ', ' Infection ', ' Influenza ', ' Grippe ', ' influenza virus vaccine ', ' Influenza Vaccines ', ' flu vaccine ', ' flu virus vaccine ', ' vaccine against flu ', ' vaccine against influenza ', ' Learning ', ' Lectin ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Avian Influenza A Virus ', ' Avian Influenza Virus ', ' Avian Orthomyxovirus Type A ', ' Fowl Plague Virus ', ' Myxovirus pestis galli ', ' avian flu virus ', ' bird flu virus ', ' Play ', ' Polysaccharides ', ' Glycans ', ' Domestic Fowls ', ' Poultry ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sea ', ' Sialic Acids ', ' N-Acetylneuraminic Acids ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Family suidae ', ' Pigs ', ' Suidae ', ' Swine ', ' porcine ', ' suid ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Trees ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' viral infection ', ' virus infection ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' Zoonoses ', ' Zoonotic ', ' Zoonotic Infection ', ' Streptavidin ', ' Strepavidin ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Natural History ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Tropism ', ' swine influenza ', ' porcine influenza ', ' wild bird ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Slide ', ' microorganism ', ' respiratory ', ' protein bound carbohydrate ', ' carbohydrate receptor ', ' carbohydrate structure ', ' Performance ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' receptor bound ', ' receptor binding ', ' biological sensor ', ' Biosensor ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Influenza A ', ' Influenza Viruses Type A ', ' Influenzavirus A ', ' Orthomyxovirus Type A ', ' Type A Influenza ', ' Influenza A virus ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' tissue tropism ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' NIAID ', ' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype ', ' H3N2 ', ' H3N2 Virus ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' Influenza prevention ', ' flu prevention ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' flu transmission ', ' influenza transmission ', ' transmission of the flu virus ', ' pathogen ', ' multitask ', ' multi-task ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' viral transmission ', ' virus transmission ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' universal influenza vaccine ', ' universal flu vaccine ', ' universal influenza virus vaccine ', ' universal vaccine against flu ', ' universal vaccine against influenza ', ' multi-task learning ', ' multitask learning ', ' in silico ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' influenza infection ', ' flu infection ', ' flu virus infection ', ' infected with flu ', ' infected with flu virus ', ' infected with influenza ', ' infected with influenza virus ', ' influenza virus infection ', ' rapid test ', ' rapid assay ', ' rapid tests ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R21,2021,199831,MO-04
"Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) Project Summary Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction  in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) We aim to develop mathematical models for the rational design of microbiota transplants that can restore compositional diversity and function to the damaged microbiota of antibiotic-treated patients. We will focus on hospitalized cancer patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (allo-HSCT). Allo-HSCT is a potentially curative cancer treatment that compromises the immune system, and requires that patients receive massive antibiotic treatments to prevent and treat life-threatening infections. We will build on a vast clinical database, in vitro experiments in bioreactors and in vivo experiments with mice to develop dynamic mathematical models that describe how antibiotics cause changes in the microbial composition, and how that can impact the recovery of the host's immune system after allo-HSCT. The model expands approaches pioneered by our team—the Generalized Lotka Volterra Ecological Regression (GLOVER) and agent-based models—towards a model that can assist in the development of microbiota therapies for patients undergoing allo-HSCT.  In aim 1 we will use data from a unique clinical resource available at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer center—a sample bank obtained from >1,500 allo-HSCT patients (including microbiome 16S rRNA and shotgun sequencing) and extensive clinical metadata (including time series of complete blood counts and time and doses of all drugs given while the patients are hospitalized); we will also use data from a first-of-its-kind controlled randomized trial of autologous fecal microbiota transplant (auto-FMT) undergoing in allo-HSCT patients. We will use these unique resources to parameterize our models and investigate how the microbiota composition influences the recovery of the host immune system. In aim 2 we will validate the microbial component of our mathematical model using experimental data from anaerobic laboratory reactors that recreate—in vitro—the human microbiota dynamics during antibiotic treatment and auto-FMT in the absence of a living host. In aim 3 we will develop mouse models to investigate those same microbiota dynamics experimentally but now in the context of a living host.  The data obtained from these clinical studies, in vitro experiments and in vivo models will refine our mathematical models in close cycles of simulation and quantitative experimentation. Our ultimate goal is to develop models that can define optimal microbial cocktails and reconstitute the perturbed microbiota of allo- HSCT patients. In the process we hope to uncover general principles of microbiota ecology for future therapies in other patient populations whose microbiota is damaged by antibiotic treatments. Project Narrative Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction  in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) The intestinal microbiota is an ecosystem with thousands of bacterial species that interact with each other and with their living host.

"Rapid fungal identification and antifungal susceptibility testing through quantitative, multiplexed RNA detection PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Timely diagnostics for fungal infections are sorely needed to guide effective therapy. Invasive fungal infections are increasing in prevalence, causing millions of deaths each year worldwide, and drug resistance poses a rising threat. Due in large part to slow, outmoded diagnostics that require days of culture to identify the pathogen and report its antifungal susceptibility profile, mortality from invasive fungal infections can exceed 40%. This in turn leads clinicians to rely on empiric and prophylactic use of antifungals that may be ineffective, cause needless toxicity, and select for resistance. Rapid precision diagnostic assays are critically needed to improve patient outcomes and guide efficient deployment of our limited antifungal arsenal.  To address this urgent public health need, in response to a specific funding opportunity announcement on “Advancing Development of Rapid Fungal Diagnostics” (PA-19-080), this proposal describes a strategy for rapid fungal identification and antifungal susceptibility testing based on RNA signatures. This approach relies on a novel paradigm for pathogen diagnostics, recently validated in bacteria and implemented on a simple, robust, quantitative, multiplexed fluorescent hybridization assay on the NanoString platform. Detection of highly abundant, conserved ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences enables broad-range, ultrasensitive pathogen identification. Meanwhile, quantifying key messenger RNA levels following antimicrobial exposure enables phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST), relying on the principle that cells that are dying or growth- arrested are transcriptionally distinct within minutes from those that are not (Bhattacharyya et al, Nature Medicine, in press). Because this approach to AST measures gene expression as an early phenotypic change in susceptible strains, it does not rely on foreknowledge of the genetic basis of resistance in order to classify susceptibility, and can thus be generalized to any pathogen-antimicrobial pair.  This proposal aims to first computationally design and experimentally validate a set of hybridization probes to uniquely recognize the 18S and 28S rRNA from each of 48 clinically significant fungal pathogens that together cause the vast majority of invasive fungal infections in humans. Preliminary data show that these rRNA targets are abundant enough to detect a single fungal cell without amplification, enabling ultrasensitive detection in <4 hours directly from clinical samples. Next, RNA-Seq will be used to profile transcriptional changes in 12 common fungal pathogens for which resistance has important clinical consequences in response to treatment with the three major classes of antifungals. Antifungal-responsive transcripts that best classify fungal isolates as susceptible or resistant will be chosen by adapting machine learning algorithms that were developed for this purpose in bacteria. Finally, both approaches will be piloted on simulated and real clinical fungal samples. Preliminary data suggest that these approaches can identify fungi within <4 hours from a primary sample, and deliver AST results within <6 hours of a positive fungal culture. PROJECT NARRATIVE Fungal infections are common, increasing in frequency and severity, and cause considerable morbidity and mortality. Early recognition of invasive fungal infection, and prompt initiation of effective antifungal therapy, are key to improving patient outcomes. This proposal aims to adapt a novel paradigm for rapid pathogen identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing through the quantitative detection of RNA signatures to transform fungal diagnostics.","Rapid fungal identification and antifungal susceptibility testing through quantitative, multiplexed RNA detection",10183157,R01AI153405,"['Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antifungal Agents ', ' Antifungal Drug ', ' Therapeutic Fungicides ', ' anti-fungal ', ' anti-fungal agents ', ' anti-fungal drug ', ' antifungals ', ' Aspergillus ', ' Azoles ', ' Bacteria ', ' Bacterial Infections ', ' bacteria infection ', ' bacterial disease ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Candida ', ' Monilia ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Drug resistance ', ' drug resistant ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' fungus ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Childhood ‘Omics’ and Mycobacterium tuberculosis-derived BiOsignatures (COMBO) for TB diagnosis in high HIV prevalence settings PROJECT SUMMARY There is an urgent need to develop non-sputum biomarker-based triage and diagnostic tests for childhood tuberculosis (TB). This is particularly important for young children with HIV infection, who have high TB-related mortality but often cannot produce sputum and have lower sputum bacillary burden. Biomarker discovery for childhood TB requires ultra-sensitive platforms to measure low-abundant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) proteins in clinical samples and greater investigation of host proteins, post-translational modifications of proteins, and metabolites that are more likely than upstream RNA expression to reflect the host-pathogen interactions that lead to TB disease. The overall objective of the proposed project is to identify Mtb- and/or host-derived biosignatures in children that can achieve World Health Organization (WHO) target product profile (TPP) accuracy thresholds for a non-sputum biomarker-based triage or diagnostic test for childhood TB. We hypothesize that biosignatures that combine Mtb proteins and host biomarkers with evidence of functional relevance to TB pathogenesis or immunity will have the best diagnostic performance. To assess this hypothesis, we will conduct biomarker discovery and initial clinical validation studies using samples from three well- characterized pediatric TB cohorts in Uganda, The Gambia and South Africa. In Aim 1, we will use an ultra- sensitive electrochemoluminescence (ECL)-based immunoassay to assess the presence of Mtb proteins ESAT- 6, CFP-10, MPT64, MPT32, and Ag85B in a discovery set of banked blood and urine samples from 100 children under 5 years old with confirmed TB and 200 with unlikely TB per NIH consensus definitions (50% HIV prevalence in both groups). In Aim 2, we will use the same discovery set to perform targeted and untargeted mass spectrometry with functional assessment through pathway analysis, in vitro models and in vivo mouse models to identify host proteins, post-translational modifications and metabolites that distinguish children with confirmed versus unlikely TB. In Aim 3, we will use the candidate Mtb and host biomarkers identified in Aims 1 and 2 to derive biosignatures with up to 10 analytes consisting of Mtb proteins only, host biomarkers only, and both Mtb- and host-derived biomarkers. Biosignatures that meet WHO TPP criteria in the discovery set will 1) be evaluated in an independent test set of banked samples from 300 children under 5 years old (100 with confirmed TB, 200 with unlikely TB; 50% HIV prevalence in each group) to verify diagnostic accuracy and establish cut- offs and 2) be evaluated in a prospective cohort of 350 children under 5 years old using the pre-select cut-offs and both microbiological and clinical reference standards. Completion of these aims will result in identification of promising biosignatures that can be further validated in large-scale field studies and translated into point-of-care triage and/or diagnostic tests for childhood TB. PROJECT NARRATIVE The inability to quickly and accurately diagnose tuberculosis (TB) in children and initiate treatment is a major contributor to the high mortality of childhood TB worldwide. This study will identify novel Mtb- and host-derived biomarkers, and determine the best biomarker panels (i.e., biosignatures) that can meet the World Health Organization-recommended diagnostic accuracy thresholds for a TB triage or diagnostic test.

"Molecular Signatures of Early-Onset Neonatal Sepsis in Umbilical Cord Blood PROJECT SUMMARY Early-onset sepsis (EOS) due to invasive bacterial infection is a leading cause of morbidity in infants and disproportionately affects those born preterm. Accurate diagnosis of EOS remains inadequate. The low sensitivity and delayed time to culture results combined with the poor predictive values of available laboratory markers leads to our inability to rule-out EOS. Thus, infants are exposed to extended duration broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics, which have serious associated adverse consequences such as necrotizing enterocolitis, antibiotic resistant infections, and an altered microbiome. The proposed research will apply proteomics to identify gestational age-specific umbilical cord blood markers toward development of a proposed diagnostic tool with strong negative risk prediction for EOS. Cord blood is promising to identify EOS as it reflects the intrauterine environment where infection originates in preterm birth. In previous work, we found that inflammatory proteins serum amyloid A, C-reactive protein and haptoglobin are substantially elevated in cord blood of preterm infants with culture-confirmed EOS. These data inform our hypothesis that a combination of cord blood proteins provides a signature to differentiate impending EOS and uninfected states. Archived cord blood from infants in an existing longitudinal cohort will be used in a nested case-control design. Aim 1 will measure the cord blood proteome of uninfected infants (controls) across gestational ages using an untargeted proteomics approach to characterize the developmental spectrum. Aim 2(a) will then determine the cord blood proteome signatures of infants with confirmed EOS (cEOS) and culture-negative presumed sepsis (PS). cEOS will be compared to matched controls to identify differentially expressed proteins and candidate markers. PS proteomes will be analyzed to help delineate true infection versus inflammatory subtypes in this heterogeneous group. Bioinformatics pathway analysis may provide novel insights into fetal immune response. Aim 2(b) will determine the best combination of markers to exclude EOS through machine learning decision analysis of proteomics data. Paired placental proteomics in Aim 2(c) will explore origins of fetal inflammation. Aim 3(a) will quantify candidate proteins by an orthogonal immunoassay method. In a validation set of new subjects, Aim 3(b) will measure candidate markers by targeted proteomics and test application of the proposed diagnostic tool. With formal didactics and a mentorship team at Northwestern University with expertise in prematurity, sepsis, biomarker discovery, biostatistics, and decision modeling led by Patrick Seed MD Ph.D., the candidate will gain advanced translational research experience and skills in perinatal research study design, advanced immunology, proteomics, and bioinformatics to further her research agenda. The proposed research and career development will be fundamental towards achieving the candidate’s career goals to: 1) lead a clinical-translational research program on the pathophysiology and host responses of perinatal infection and 2) bring new, reliable sepsis diagnostics to clinical practice, to improve neonatal outcomes through targeted treatment of EOS and antibiotic stewardship. PROJECT NARRATIVE Invasive bacterial infections in newborns carry a high risk of complications and death, yet current diagnostic methods are inaccurate, resulting in the harmful overuse of antibiotics. The proposed work will develop a multi- factor diagnostic model for early-onset neonatal sepsis using umbilical cord blood proteins as biomarkers and enhance our understanding of fetal immune response.

"Immune profiling to stratify Clostridioides difficile infection outcomes Candidate: Dr. Gregory Madden is an Assistant Professor of Infectious Diseases at the University of Virginia with experience in research regarding the diagnosis, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of C. difficile infection. Career Development Plan and Goals: The proposed K23 Mentored Career Development Award will uniquely establish Dr. Madden as a translational researcher with experience in host-pathogen interactions and advanced modeling techniques. Training activities for the award include graduate-level coursework in clinical trial design and statistical modeling, culminating with a Master’s Degree of Science in Clinical Research. Research Plan: Clostridioides difficile is the leading healthcare-associated pathogen in the US. Evidence suggests that the host innate immune system (particularly Type 2, or eosinophil-mediated immunity), fecal C. difficile burden, and Binary toxin play important roles in C. difficile infection. However, no model to predict outcomes of C. difficile infection takes these factors into account. Data from our lab show that eosinopenia, specific biomarkers of pathogenic immunity (i.e., Soluble ST2 Receptor, IL-6), fecal organism burden, and the presence of fecal Binary Toxin are associated with increased C. difficile mortality. Dr. Madden, proposes to: 1) Construct a clinical-immunologic database of C. difficile patients to develop a robust biomarker-based model for outcomes of C. difficile infection and 2) Prospectively validate this model alongside the leading clinical models. Successful completion of the proposed research will create a validated immune profile for C. difficile infection outcomes that reflects our latest understanding of pathogenesis. In addition, we will identify a much-needed optimal approach for researchers and clinicians to stratify life-threatening C. difficile infection at the time of diagnosis. Mentors: Dr. Madden’s mentor is Dr. William A. Petri, MD, PhD, a leading researcher in the field of host defense against C. difficile. Internal advisors and collaborators have diverse expertise in hospital epidemiology (Dr. Costi Sifri, accomplished practicing hospital epidemiologist with a background studying molecular pathogenesis), immunology (Dr. Melanie Rutkowsi, PhD, biostatistics/machine learning (Jennie Ma, PhD), clinical trial design (Dr. James A. Platts-Mills, MD), and molecular diagnostics (Eric R. Houpt, MD). Environment: The University of Virginia is world-renowned for its work in enteric diseases and is one of the first institutions to establish a School dedicated to Data Science. The University of Virginia Data Science Institute, School of Public Health Sciences, Office of Hospital Epidemiology, and the Petri Lab will provide the resources as well as the diverse and stimulating environment for this Candidate to flourish as an independent investigator in this cutting-edge field. C. difficile is the leading cause of healthcare-associated infection, yet no single test or validated model is capable of reliably telling which patients are at risk of dying from the infection. New research suggests that a patient's immune system, and possibly other factors such as Binary Toxin, may be the key to understanding how they will respond to C. difficile. This work will combine known risk factors with new markers from the blood and stool into an integrated scoring system that predicts which patients will develop severe or life-threatening C. difficile

"A data science approach to identify and manage Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and Kawasaki disease in pediatric patients Summary – Since the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic began, the emergence of an associated novel multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has been reported. Interestingly, patients with MIS-C follow a presentation, management and clinical course that are somewhat similar to that of patients with Kawasaki disease (KD). Currently, the reason for such an overlap in clinical features and management is unclear and whether this overlap is the result of a partially shared etiology or pathophysiology is the subject of fierce debates. The degree of overlap implies that some of the clinical prediction tools that we have developed in the past for KD could be repurposed to accelerate the development of clinical support decision tools for MIS-C. In this study, we will first (R61 component) systematically address the overlap between KD and MIS-C and create salient machine-learning based prediction models for diagnosis/identification (Aim #1), management (Aim #2), and short- and long-term outcomes (Aim #3) of MIS-C based on our previously developed predictive models for KD in a process akin to transfer learning. Secondly (R33 component), we will validate and evaluate the performance and clinical utility of these models in a predictive clinical decision support system for the diagnosis and management of pediatric patients presenting with features indicative of either MIS-C or KD. In this study we will include 3 groups of patients: 1) patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection with MIS-C (CDC criteria) regardless of whether they have overlapping signs of KD, 2) patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection investigated for but eventually not diagnosed with MIS-C, and 3) patients with KD but without SARS-CoV-2 infection. Targeted data will be collected from enrolled patients (900 for training and 450 for validation) for deep phenotyping and biomarker measurements. Physician feedback on the predictions generated by the algorithm will be used to establish clinical utility. Data required for model training will be accrued in the first two years of activity (R61 period of the grant); the development of algorithms and their internal validation will occur concurrently. In the following 2 years (R33 period of the grant), we will perform external validation, establish clinical utility, add real- time epidemiological surveillance data to the models and finally package, and certify the algorithms for future deployment and for the integration in electronic health records. This project will be a collaboration with the International Kawasaki Disease Registry (IKDR) Consortium. The IKDR Consortium has an active KD and pediatric COVID registry in 35 sites across the world and the number of sites is currently expanding to 60+ sites. More than 600 MIS-C patients have already been identified at IKDR centers, making this project clearly feasible and perfectly positioning IKDR to perform this study. We strongly believe that the use of emerging data science methods and of our previously developed algorithms in the context of KD, as opposed to focusing on MIS-C patients alone, will boost our understanding of the etiology and pathophysiology of both MIS-C and KD and will more rapidly lead to the emergence of data-driven management protocols for patients with MIS-C. Project narrative - The primary objective of this study is to design and validate a predictive decision support system for the identification, treatment and management of SARS-CoV-2 associated with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). To develop this system, we will adapt and retrain machine learning algorithms which we have previously trained in patients with Kawasaki Disease, a pediatric inflammatory vasculopathy with multiple similarities to MIS-C. This study, performed in collaboration with the International Kawasaki Disease Registry (IKDR) consortium, will consist of two phases, first a large-scale data collection and algorithm development effort and second, the prospective evaluation of the performance and clinical utility of the algorithm ahead of large-scale deployment.",A data science approach to identify and manage Multisystem

"Fluomics: The Next Generation Influenza A virus is a major human respiratory pathogen, and available vaccines and antivirals are of limited efficacy. In order to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention during influenza virus infection, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team that uses a highly integrated systems level approach to identify and validate key genes/networks involved in virus pathogenesis. The overarching theme of our multidisciplinary proposal “FluOMICS: The NEXT Generation” is to obtain multiple OMICS-based systems level measurements and integrate them using modeling approaches and machine learning algorithms to identify and validate 1) host-virus networks that modulate influenza A virus disease severity, 2) biomarkers in blood that reflect the activation states of these networks and 3) novel host targets for therapeutic interventions. Our underlying main hypothesis is that host networks involved in viral replication and early host responses regulate disease outcomes and represent targets for therapeutic intervention. The proposed studies leverage on our previous collaborations that generated global datasets and models that predict severity of disease caused by three influenza virus strains with different levels of virulence. While our previous studies gave many novel insights in influenza pathogenesis, they likely provide a narrow window on the determinants of disease severity in humans. Thus, it is necessary expand beyond the specific virus strains that were used to study pathogenesis, and explore a broader context of viral and host perturbations linked to clinical outcomes. In order to identify clinically relevant networks involved in influenza virus pathogenesis we propose to integrate into predictive and comprehensive models global responses during influenza virus infection in three systems 1) human blood from a human cohort of patients with documented influenza virus infection and diverse clinical outcomes (Project 1); 2) mouse blood and tissues from experimentally infected animals under a variety of conditions and perturbations resulting in diverse disease outcomes (Project 1) and 3) relevant primary human cells (Project 2). Samples will be processed and send to the Technology Core for global transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics analysis. OMICS data sets will be integrated and compared by the Modeling Core to generate network models of disease, uncover blood biomarkers and identify key drivers as targets for therapeutic intervention. Predicted network regulators will be used as a source for subsequent iterative rounds of perturbations to refine existing and to identify new network disease models. Data and models will be managed and disseminated by the Data Management and Bioinformatics Core. We expect that these studies will uncover and validate novel pathogenic networks, blood biomarkers associated with them, and specific therapeutic targets to revert pathogenic networks. In summary, our modeling approaches will find correlates and associations between diverse experimental systems that will help us define human blood biomarkers, and link them to in vivo and ex vivo signatures for both companion diagnostics and personalized therapies. We propose a systematic approach (FluOMICS) to generate predictive models of influenza virus pathogenesis which will a) allow us to identify biomarkers for predicting disease outcome, and b) provide avenues to explore for new, host-directed, therapeutic interventions.",Fluomics: The Next Generation,10265790,U19AI135972,"['Animals ', ' Antiviral Agents ', ' Antiviral Drugs ', ' Antivirals ', '

"In Vivo Cluster AI Prediction (CLAIRE) of COVID-19 Disease Progression ABSTRACT The coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic, which early this year forced entire countries into lockdown, has reached a global death toll of 890,000+ by early September 2020. Based on the high number of COVID-19 cases that are asymptomatic but infectious, an estimated reproductive rate of infection of about 2 and a high mutation rate, it is expected that the virus will remain in the population as the influenza virus does. For hospitals serving areas whose economy relies on international travel, tourism, and cruise ship tourism, such as Miami-Dade county, new COVID-19 cases related to travel will require treatment during infection outbreaks which will strain health systems, especially during the infectious respiratory disease season in the winter. Patient risk factors during the current COVID-19 outbreak as well as during other viral outbreaks, such as seasonal influenza, are poorly characterized, consequently negatively affecting patient care. The saliva microbiome, which includes viruses and bacteria, is not currently used as in diagnostic tools. However, it may reveal risk factors associated with severe disease and/or a fatal outcome, and it allows for the detection and study of the viral RNA sequence for potential contact tracing and molecular epidemiology, all of which affect both vaccine and antiviral efficacy. In this proposed study, Lifetime Omics will develop CLAIRE, a proof-of-concept in vivo cluster AI platform for predicting disease progression of viral infectious respiratory diseases such as COVID-19 through the analysis of the saliva metagenome. The University of Miami Medical Group Infection Control (UMMGIC) division will collaborate in this effort by collecting saliva samples from COVID-19 patients with de-identified clinical information. The samples will undergo metagenomic sequencing and Lifetime Omics will repurpose algorithms used for prediction of in vivo HIV evolution to perform genetic/phylogenetic analysis on SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequences, estimating mutation rate and immune selection pressures and identifying both the in vivo quasispecies clusters and the geographic cluster to which the patient belongs. The CLAIRE models will be trained with public datasets and tested on the metagenomic sequences generated from saliva samples of UMMGIC patients with the goal of assisting physicians in predicting disease progression in COVID-19. NARRATIVE During the current COVID-19 pandemic, it is difficult for physicians admitting new patients to the hospital to distinguish patients whose disease will be mild from those who will have a severe disease progression. While this can also occur with the seasonal flu and other infectious respiratory diseases, the degree of severity seen in COVID-19, the potential of accelerated deterioration, and the high pressure on hospital resources for extended periods of time present a compelling and urgent need to better understand and anticipate the risk factors that may drive severe disease. Lifetime Omics is developing CLAIRE, a viral cluster AI system for prediction of infectious respiratory disease progression, such as COVID-19, using metagenomics and AI to provide personalized information to inform treatment decisions, help improve outcomes, and better utilize healthcare resources.",In Vivo Cluster AI Prediction (CLAIRE) of COVID-19 Disease

"Automated Dental Fracture Detection using High Resolution CBCT and Advanced Image Analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Epidemiological studies indicate that cracked teeth are the third most common cause of tooth loss in industrialized countries. Histological studies demonstrate that all cracks are colonized by bacteria, which have  the potential to cause intensely painful pulpal and periapical infections. The early detection of cracks (incomplete fractures) followed by appropriate interventions to prevent crack propagation are effective strategies to prevent  infections and avert tooth loss. Current tools used to diagnose cracks are inadequate and there is an imperative need to develop an objective and reliable method to detect cracks. During our Phase I project, we developed  and tested a novel algorithm for crack detection on extracted human teeth. Using machine learning and imaging  features extracted from three-dimensional (3D) wavelets, we demonstrated enhanced crack detection hr-CBCT. We now propose to further refine this technology and to validate it clinically. Our hypothesis is that our method  increases the predictive validity of hr-CBCT in detecting cracks. This development will happen with close clinical  guidance. Also, we will collaborate with CBCT hardware vendors to increase the impact of our commercialization plan. This proposal addresses the need for quantitative, reproducible, and evidence-based ways to detect cracks in teeth, that can potentially lead to improved tooth loss prevention.

"Precision immunoprofiling to reveal diagnostic biomarkers of latent TB infection PROJECT SUMMARY  Tuberculosis (TB) is among the leading causes of mortality worldwide with an estimated 2 billion individuals currently infected. Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is the most common form of TB infection affecting 13 million Americans. While many with LTBI remain asymptomatic, an estimated 10% of immunocompetent patients with LTBI will reactivate to active TB, and will become infectious. LTBI is treatable with a prolonged antibiotic treatment; however, potential side effects motivate the development of new diagnostic approaches that can identify with high specificity patients at the highest risk of reactivation, for who therapy would be most beneficial.  The tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) are commonly used for TB and LTBI screening. Both tests provide good measures of TB exposure; however, neither is effective at diagnosing LTBI (positive predictive values <5%). Moreover, neither provide any prognostic stratification based upon reactivation risk. Both the TST and IGRAs probe immunological memory to TB-related antigen challenges and we hypothesize that a more nuanced and personalized approach to monitoring immune responses to both TB- specific and non-specific antigens might reveal new approaches to LTBI diagnosis and patient stratification.  Enabling a new, individualized approach to LTBI diagnostics, we propose to combine high throughput, multiplexed inflammatory biomarker detection strategies and powerful bioinformatics tools that allow for the identification of previously obscured multi-marker diagnostic signatures of LTBI status and reactivation risk. Silicon photonic microring resonators are an enabling technology for biomarker analysis due to their intrinsic scalability and multiplexing capabilities. Applied to the detection of cytokine panels, this technology supports the rapid immune profiling of individual samples under both TB-specific and non-specific antigen stimulation conditions. Machine learning algorithms will be utilized to analyze the resulting dense data streams to facilitate selection of key diagnostic signatures forming the basis for predictive model development and deployment. This powerful analytical combination is supplemented by deep expertise in clinical diagnosis and treatment of TB and LTBI, and an enabling collaboration and connection to subjects from an international location with high TB burden and exposure in a healthcare worker population subjected to regularly-scheduled and repeated LTBI screening.  The resulting diagnostic workflow and machine learning feature selection approaches will reveal multiplexed biomarker signatures that have strong positive predictive correlation with LTBI status (+ or -). This approach will also further stratify LTBI+ subjects on the basis of reactivation potential, thus providing a fundamentally new approach to identifying subjects that are most likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. The end result of this project will be a new precision medicine-based diagnostic strategy that is vastly superior to the current state-of-the-art and offers the potential to transform current clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Tuberculosis (TB) affects an estimated one third of the world’s population and an asymptomatic latent state of tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is extremely common. Unfortunately, there are not any good clinical tests that can definitely diagnose LTBI, making it difficult to identify patients that should be treated to prevent reactivation to active TB, which is infectious. We will integrate cutting edge measurement technologies and machine learning bioinformatic approaches to identify and test multiplexed biomarker signatures that will transform clinical TB management by enabling personalized diagnosis of LTBI and the stratification of individuals with the highest potential for reactivation.",Precision immunoprofiling to reveal diagnostic biomarkers of latent TB

"NBER Center for Aging and Health Research OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Summary/Abstract Lessons for COVID-19 from the Great Influenza Pandemic of 1918 to 1920 There is currently great concern about the health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. One issue is how non-pharmaceutical public-health interventions (NPIs) impact the spread of the disease and, hence, fatality rates. A second is the inequality in infection rates and deaths across people with different socioeconomic characteristics. The goal of this project is to draw lessons for today from the Great Influenza Pandemic, which began in spring 1918, peaked during a second wave in late 1918 and early 1919, persisted through 1920, and cumulatively killed 40 million people worldwide. Using a combination of cross-city and cross-national analyses, the project will study how disease outcomes from the Great Influenza Pandemic relate to variations in population demographics and patterns of NPI use. The project will assess how disease outcomes relate to the types and durations of non-pharmaceutical public-health interventions implemented across geographic locations and over time. It will characterize the NPIs that were adopted during the Great Influenza Pandemic in terms of type, intensity, and duration of application. Among the NPIs to be considered are school closings, prohibitions of public gatherings, and quarantine/isolation. The project will analyze variations in infections, deaths, population demographics, and NPI use across at least 45 large US cities, 48 countries, and cities in Spain and England, where high-frequency data are available on flu-related excess mortality. The project will be conducted as a supplement to grant P30-AG012810, the NBER Center for Aging and Health Research.

"Point-of-care antimicrobial susceptibility testing based on simultaneous tracking of multi-phenotypic features of single bacterial cells ABSTRACT Antibiotic resistance has become a significant public health threat. To combat the problem, a rapid pathogen identification (ID) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) technology is needed to provide timely diagno- sis of resistant infections and delivery of accurate antibiotic treatment at primary health-care settings, includ- ing hospitals and point-of-care (POC). The present project aims to develop a point-of-care AST (POCASTTM) technology based on a large-image-volume microscopy technique that enables direct detection of individual bacterial cells in clinical samples without culturing or pathogen isolation, and a machine-learning model that allows fast determination of pathogen and susceptibility. To establish the technology, the project will focus on urinary tract infections (UTIs). UTIs affect millions of people annually, and the pathogens that usually cause UTIs are the organisms that pose the highest threat of antimicrobial resistance, including carbapenem- resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteri- aceae. This project will focus on: 1) developing the large-image-volume microscopy and machine learning model for simultaneous tracking of multi-phenotypic features of single bacterial cells directly in patient urine sample, and performing rapid automatic pathogen ID and AST for UTIs; 2) building prototype instrument, and 3) validating the instrument for UTIs using large scale clinical samples. Successful development and validation of the tech- nology will enable precise antibiotic prescription on the same day of patient visit. The project will be carried out by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in biosensors (Biodesign Center for Bioelectronics and Biosensors, ASU), microbiology and infectious diseases (Biodesign Center for Immuno- therapy, Vaccines and Virotherapy, ASU), biomedical instrument development and production (Biosensing Instrument Inc.), and clinical testing (Clinical Microbiology Laboratory, Mayo Clinic). ! PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop a culture-independent technology for point-of-care diagnosis of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in urinary tract infections within 3 hours, by imaging urine samples directly with an innovative large- image-volume imaging technique and analyzing the data with a machine-learning model. Successful devel- opment of the technology will enable precise antibiotic prescriptions and accurate treatment of the patient on the same day of visit. !",Point-of-care antimicrobial susceptibility testing based on simultaneous tracking of multi-phenotypic features of single bacterial cells,10188407,R01AI138993,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Arizona ', ' Bacterial Infections ', ' bacteria infection ', ' bacterial disease ', ' Biosensing Techniques ', ' Biosensing Technics ', ' biosensing ', ' Blood Cells ', ' Peripheral Blood Cell ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Crystallization ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Enterobacteriaceae ', ' Coliform Bacilli ', ' Enteric Bacteria ', ' Enterobacteria ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Hospitals ', ' Immunotherapy ', ' Immune mediated therapy ', ' Immunologically Directed Therapy ', ' immune therapeutic approach ', ' immune therapeutic interventions ', ' immune therapeutic regimens ', ' immune therapeutic strategy ', ' immune therapy ', ' immune-based therapies ', ' immune-based treatments ', ' immuno therapy ', ' Infection ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Microbiology ', ' Microscopy ', ' Motion ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Production ', ' Public Health ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Urinary tract infection ', ' Urinary tract infectious disease ', ' urinary infection ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Vaccines ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' Antibiotic Resistance ', ' Resistance to antibiotics ', ' Resistant to antibiotics ', ' antibiotic drug resistance ', ' antibiotic resistant ', ' bacterial resistance ', ' Bacteria resistance ', ' Bacteria resistant ', ' Bacterial resistant ', ' resistance to Bacteria ', ' resistance to Bacterial ', ' resistant to Bacteria ', ' resistant to Bacterial ', ' base ', ' density ', ' image processing ', ' Microscope ', ' Clinical ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Point of Care Technology ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Morphology ', ' Antibiotic Treatment ', ' bacterial disease treatment ', ' bacterial infectious disease treatment ', ' Antibiotic Therapy ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' anti-microbial susceptibility ', ' Antimicrobial susceptibility ', ' Hour ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' light scattering ', ' Performance ', ' tech development ', ' technology development ', ' biological sensor ', ' Biosensor ', ' Speed ', ' Agreement ', ' Categories ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Clinical Microbiology ', ' Address ', ' Antimicrobial resistant ', ' Resistance to antimicrobial ', ' anti-microbial resistance ', ' anti-microbial resistant ', ' resistance to anti-microbial ', ' resistant to anti-microbial ', ' resistant to antimicrobial ', ' Antimicrobial Resistance ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' device development ', ' instrument development ', ' Device or Instrument Development ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Validation ', ' technology validation ', ' technology implementation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' point of care ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' pathogen ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' antimicrobial ', ' anti-microbial ', ' Pathogen detection ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' prototype ', ' combat ', ' Virotherapy ', ' Virotherapeutics ', ' carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae ', ' Extended-spectrum β-lactamase ', ' Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' automated algorithm ', ' automatic algorithm ', ' point-of-care diagnosis ', ' ']",NIAID,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2021,1079736,AZ-09
"Pan-vaccine Analysis to Test the Impact of Cytomegalovirus on Vaccine Efficacy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infects around 50% of the US population. Even though the CMV exists in a latent state in healthy individuals, it profoundly shapes the immune system. Recent studies suggest that the CMV infection alters the immune response to influenza vaccine. However, the exact effect of CMV on the efficacy of the influenza vaccine remains controversial. In addition, how CMV shapes the immune responses toward other vaccines are unknown. We hypothesize that latent CMV infection induces critical changes in the immune system, which alters the efficacy of multiple types of vaccines. The ImmPort database currently hosts 133 vaccine studies, covering 21 types of vaccines, creating an unprecedented opportunity for us to test our hypothesis. We will perform a comprehensive meta-analysis to test the relationship between CMV and vaccine efficacies, and will use state-of-art statistical models (e.g., Dynamic Bayesian Network) to identify the mechanism by which CMV alters the vaccine response. Leveraging the group's expertise in computational immunology and rich datasets on ImmPort, we will address the following aims. Aim1: Test the effect of CMV on influenza vaccine outcome. We will perform a meta-analysis of 60 influenza studies available on ImmPort to test the impact of CMV. We will quantify and standardize the efficacy of influenza vaccine across studies, which are measured by hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) assays before and after the vaccination. We will also determine the CMV infection status in subjects, either directly from serological tests or indirectly from immune- phenotyping data using cutting-edge machine learning tools. We will then test if CMV increases the response to influenza vaccine by analyzing data from all studies in a unified statistical framework while taking the heterogeneity between studies into account. Aim2: Bayesian network analysis of influenza vaccine response. We will harmonize multimodal immune-phenotyping data from the influenza vaccine studies, including transcriptomics data, cytometry data, and cytokine measurements. We will use state-of-art network analysis methods (e.g., Dynamic Bayesian network) to model the interplay between the immune components over time. Using the Bayesian network, we will investigate the mechanism by which CMV shapes the outcome of influenza vaccination. Aim3: Explore the effect of CMV infection on other vaccines. We will extend our analysis to vaccines other than influenza vaccine, (e.g., West Nile, Hepatitis B, yellow fever, malaria, and Tuberculosis). We will quantify the vaccine efficacy using assays specific to the vaccine type, such as Controlled Human Malaria Infection (CHMI) for the malaria vaccine and Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test for the yellow fever vaccine. We will perform separate network analyses to characterize the relationship between CMV and the immune response of individual vaccines. We will then perform joint analysis across vaccine types to identify the common impact of CMV across vaccine types. PROJECT NARRATIVE Infectious diseases remain an urgent problem, resulting in an estimated 3 million deaths worldwide and more than 110,000 deaths in the United States annually, but the efficacy of vaccines against many infectious diseases remains suboptimal, including malaria, influenza, and dengue. To improve the vaccines, it is crucial to understand the factors that affect the immune response toward vaccines. In this study, we investigate how cytomegalovirus affects the efficacy of multiple vaccines, providing valuable information for improving the design of vaccines.",Pan-vaccine Analysis to Test the

"A priori adaptive evolution predictions for antibiotic resistance through genome-wide network analyses and machine learning SUMMARY Adaptive evolution (AE) is both a “force of good” as it can help to optimize biological processes in industry, but it is also a “force of frustration” when infectious diseases exploit AE to escape the host immune system or become resistant to drugs. It has long been assumed close to impossible to make predictions on AE due to the presumed predominating influences of random forces and events. However, the observation that evolutionary repeatability across traits and species is far more common than previously thought, suggests that AE, with the right data and approach, may become (partially) predictable. Indeed, we found through experiments with the bacterial pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae on its response to antibiotics and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance, that in order to make AE predictable a detailed understanding of at least two aspects of the bacterial system are required: 1.) the genetic constraints of the system (i.e. the architecture of the organismal network); and 2.) where and how in the system stress is experienced and processed. We showed that by mapping out ~25% of the bacterium's network, determining phenotypic and transcriptional antibiotic responses, applying network analyses to capture and quantify the responses in a network context, and exploiting experimental evolution to pin-point adaptive mutations in the genome it becomes possible, by means of machine learning, to uncover hidden patterns in the data that make AE predictions feasible. This means that the network in interaction with the environment shapes the adaptive landscape, it limits available solutions and makes some solutions more likely than others, thereby driving repeatability and enabling predictability. In this proposal we build on these exciting developments with the goal to map out the constraints of S. pneumoniae's entire network and develop a machine learning model that can forecast adaptive evolution a priori, and on a genome-wide scale. To accomplish this, we combine in aim 1 parts of Tn-Seq, dTn-Seq and Drop-Seq to finalize a new tool Tn-Seq^2 (Tn-Seq squared) that is able to map genetic-interactions in high-throughput and genome-wide. We use Tn-Seq^2 to reconstruct the first genome-wide genetic interaction network for S. pneumoniae in the presence of 20 antibiotics. In aim 2 we create 85 HA-tagged Transcription factor induction (TFI) strains and: a) Determine with ChIP-Seq the DNA-binding sites for all 85 TFs in S. pneumoniae; b) By overexpressing each TFI strain followed by RNA- Seq we determine each TFs regulatory signature; c) Use a Transcriptional Regulator Induced Phenotype screen in the presence of 20 antibiotics to untangle environment specific links between genetic and transcriptional perturbations and their phenotypic outcomes. Lastly, in aim 3, we train and test a variety of machine learning approaches to design an optimal model that predicts which genes in the genome are most likely to adapt in the presence of a specific antibiotic. The development of this predictive AE model, will not only be useful in predicting the emergence of antibiotic resistance, but the strategy should be valuable for most any biological field for which adaptive changes are important, ranging from biological engineering to cancer. NARRATIVE Adaptive evolution (AE) is the driving force behind the emergence of antibiotic resistance and if it were possible to predict AE before it happens, it could help in preventing resistance. Here we use cutting-edge existing and newly designed genomics tools and analytical approaches to develop a machine learning model that can predict AE a priori, and on a genome-wide scale.",A priori adaptive evolution predictions for antibiotic resistance through genome-wide network analyses and machine learning,10155396,R01AI148470,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Affect ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Bacteria ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Biomass ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Drug resistance ', ' drug resistant ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Escherichia coli ', ' E coli ', ' E. coli ', ' Evolution ', ' Fermentation ', ' Frustration ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Industry ', ' Maps ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Phenotype ', ' Photosynthesis ', ' Streptococcus pneumoniae ', ' D pneumoniae ', ' D. pneumoniae ', ' Diplococcus pneumoniae ', ' Pneumococcus ', ' S pneumoniae ', ' S. pneumoniae ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Yeasts ', ' Antibiotic Resistance ', ' Resistance to antibiotics ', ' Resistant to antibiotics ', ' antibiotic drug resistance ', ' antibiotic resistant ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Planet Earth ', ' Earth ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' trait ', ' novel ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' immune drugs ', ' immune-based therapeutics ', ' immunologic preparation ', ' immunologic therapeutics ', ' immunotherapeutics ', ' immunotherapy agent ', ' Immunotherapeutic agent ', ' Genomics ', ' DNA Binding Interaction ', ' DNA bound ', ' DNA Binding ', ' µfluidic ', ' Microfluidics ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' pathogenic bacteria ', ' bacteria pathogen ', ' bacterial pathogen ', ' driving force ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' overexpression ', ' overexpress ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' process optimization ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' network architecture ', ' genomic tools ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' droplet sequencing ', ' Drop-seq ', ' genetic architecture ', ' emerging antimicrobial resistance ', ' anti-microbial resistance emergence ', ' antimicrobial resistance emergence ', ' emerging anti-microbial resistance ', ' emerging antibiotic resistance ', ' antibiotic resistance emergence ', ' transposon sequencing ', ' Tn-seq ', ' Tnseq ', ' transposon insertion sequencing ', ' ']",NIAID,BOSTON COLLEGE,R01,2021,391250,MA-04
"Accelerating phage evolution and tools via synthetic biology and machine learning Summary Phages, which are the naturally evolved predators of bacteria, may hold the key to combating bacterial pathogens, including the looming threat of multidrug resistant bacteria. Phages are viruses which while harmless to humans and have been successfully engineered as tools to separate, concentrate, and detect their bacterial hosts. Additionally, phages have been used as therapeutic agents to treat patients infected with pathogens resistant to known antibiotics. While the potential benefits of phages are numerous, certain limitations must be addressed in order to fully employ them. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that both top-down and bottom-up approaches can be utilized to design and synthesize novel phages, through a combination of synthetic biology and machine learning. This will result in phage-based tools with increased functionality and customizable host ranges. The rationale for the proposed research is that as the threat of bacterial infections including those with multi-drug resistance continues to grow, phages, which have evolved to efficiently recognize and kill bacteria, will become indispensable tools. Therefore, the ability to rapidly design and engineer new phages for biosensing and therapeutics will be a critical advantage to human health. The proposal contains three specific aims which are supported by preliminary data and cited literature. Aim 1: Site-directed conjugation for advanced phage-based biosensors and therapeutics. Under this aim, phages will be modified with alkyne-containing unnatural amino acids allowing their direct conjugation to 1) azide decorated magnetic nanoparticles, and 2) azide terminated polyethylene glycol. The modifications will allow the development of magnetic phages for bacteria separation and detection, and phages that are more effective therapeutics due to their ability to avoid a patient’s innate immune response, respectively. Aim 2: Decoding phage biorecognition elements using machine learning. In this aim, machine learning will be used to model the binding of phages and their bacterial hosts. The model will enable the prediction of host interactions as well as allow the design and synthesis of novel phage tail fibers which can target specific bacterial isolates. Aim 3: Repurposing phage biorecognition for a broader host ranges. Under the final aim, phage-binding proteins will be replaced with those known to recognize conserved regions of the bacterial LPS, resulting in a phage with a much broader host range. This approach is innovative because it uses top-down characterizations for bottom-up design and synthesis of novel phages. Traditional phage screening methods will be replaced with the rapid synthesis of phages, which are optimized for a particular bacterial isolate. Following the successful completion of the specific aims, the expected outcome is the design and synthesis of phages that can be used to target a selected group of bacteria within Enterobacteriaceae for advanced biosensing and therapeutics. A publically available computer model will allow rapid design of custom phage biorecognition elements which can be added to functionalized phages. These technologies will allow researchers to tip the scales of the co-evolutionary arms race between phage and bacteria. Narrative The project is relevant to public health because it accelerates the development of phage-based tools for the rapid detection of bacterial pathogens in human, food, and environmental samples, and the treatment of diseases from multidrug resistant bacteria by integrating machine learning and synthetic biology. Thus, it is specifically relevant to part of NIH's mission that pertains to the diagnosis, prevention, and cure of human diseases.",Accelerating phage evolution and tools via synthetic biology and

"Digital High Resolution Melt and Machine Learning for Rapid and Specific Diagnosis in Neonatal Sepsis Project Summary Blood culture sensitivity in neonates is poor but is the “Gold Standard” for the diagnosis of sepsis. Universal genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (U-HRM) provides a simple, low cost, rapid, and modern alternative to blood culture testing. By measuring the fluorescence of an intercalating dye as PCR-amplified pathogen DNA fragments are heated and disassociate, sequence defined melt curves are generated with single-nucleotide resolution in a closed-tube reaction. We have advanced U- HRM into a digital PCR format (U-dHRM), where DNA sequences that are present in mixtures are individually amplified and identified as is needed for polymicrobial infections. We have also established unique signature melt curves for 37 bacterial species that commonly infect older children and adults and automatically identify them using machine learning technology. With the goal of creating an accurate and valid test for the timely diagnosis of neonatal sepsis, we will advance this technology to identify unique fungal, viral, and bacterial HRM signatures along with antibiotic resistance genes with an accuracy of 99-100% on minimal blood volume (1mL). Our aims are: Aim 1. Optimize and assess the U-dHRM platform for neonatal bacteremia diagnosis by expand our bacterial database (13 additional bacteria) to detect causes of >99% of neonatal bacterial infections, expand our antibiotic resistance gene database to include five clinically actionable genes, and assessing the performance of the system for bacteremia diagnosis in mock and clinical whole blood samples; Aim 2. Advance the U-dHRM platform for simultaneous detection of fungal and viral pathogens by upgrading our optical system to enable expansion to fungal and viral detection in a high-throughput format, multiplexing the assay to expand to viral and fungal pathogens causing >99% non-bacterial infections, and conducting analytical validation of the multiplexed platform using mock whole blood samples; and Aim 3. Advance the machine learning algorithm for detection of emerging pathogens by developing and integrating an anomaly detection algorithm for reporting emerging pathogens that are not included in our database and validating the algorithm using data generated in Aims 1 and 2. Thus, this proposal directly addresses the funding call by applying a multidisciplinary approach to overcome the biomedical challenge of rapidly diagnosis sepsis, a hidden public health disaster. Project Narrative Digital High Resolution Melting (dHRM) of DNA combined with machine learning creates unique “fingerprints"" for microbes and antibiotic resistance, allowing for faster and more precise detection and treatment of pathogen(s) causing sepsis. This project will advance and test the clinical performance of dHRM technology in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. Our goal is to rapidly and accurately identify pathogens and their resistance markers to facilitate accurate antimicrobial therapy, reducing antibiotic overuse in non-infected infants.",Digital High Resolution Melt and Machine Learning for Rapid and Specific Diagnosis in Neonatal Sepsis,10151581,R01AI134982,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Bacteremia ', ' bacteraemia ', ' Bacteria ', ' Bacterial Infections ', ' bacteria infection ', ' bacterial disease ', ' Birth Weight ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Volume ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disasters ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Dyes ', ' Coloring Agents ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Fluorescence ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Infection ', ' Modernization ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Antibiotic Resistance ', ' Resistance to antibiotics ', ' Resistant to antibiotics ', ' antibiotic drug resistance ', ' antibiotic resistant ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Tube ', ' base ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Clinical ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Funding ', ' Very Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' VLBW ', ' very low birth weight ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Exposure to ', ' septic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Whole Blood ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Hour ', ' Reaction ', ' System ', ' neonatal sepsis ', ' intrapartum ', ' Viral ', ' Performance ', ' rapid diagnosis ', ' microbial ', ' melting ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' diagnosis standard ', ' antibiotic resistant bacteria ', ' bacterial antibiotic resistant ', ' bacterial resistance to antibiotic ', ' Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Emerging Technologies ', ' Emergent Technologies ', ' Validation ', ' point of care ', ' early onset ', ' therapy resistant ', ' resistance to therapy ', ' resistant to therapy ', ' therapeutic resistance ', ' treatment resistance ', ' neonate ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' viral detection ', ' virus detection ', ' Sepsis ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' Neonatal ', ' pathogen ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' antimicrobial ', ' anti-microbial ', ' Microbe ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' resistance gene ', ' resistance locus ', ' resistant gene ', ' circulating DNA ', ' clinically actionable ', ' pathogen genome ', ' pathogenome ', ' overtreatment ', ' over-treatment ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' pathogenic fungus ', ' fungal pathogen ', ' fungi pathogen ', ' pathogenic virus ', ' viral pathogen ', ' virus pathogen ', ' pathogen genomics ', ' detection limit ', ' emerging pathogen ', ' new pathogen ', ' novel pathogen ', ' multiplex assay ', ' ']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2021,469594,CA-52
"Effects of Host Metabolic Variation on Antibiotic Susceptibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Host variation affects the pathogenicity of, susceptibility to, and recovery from infectious diseases. Elucidating how the host environment alters antibiotic susceptibility is therefore a critical step towards the long-term goal of realizig precision medicine for the clinical management of infectious diseases. The overall objective of this project is to identify the metabolic pathways participating in antibiotic susceptibility and t determine how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatments at the site of infection. The working hypothesis is that metabolic processes can function as bacterial control mechanisms for antibiotic susceptibility and that the host metabolome can act on these processes to affect the outcome of antibiotic treatment. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: (1) identif metabolic pathways involved in antibiotic susceptibility (K99 phase); (2) characterize changes in the host metabolome elicited by antibiotic administration (K99 phase); (3) evaluate effects of the host metabolome on antibiotic killing (R00 phase). During the mentored K99 phase, bactericidal antibiotics will be counterscreened with various metabolites to identify metabolic perturbations that can affect antibiotic susceptibility. Metabolic pathways contributing to antibiotic lethality ill be identified by combining this data with metabolic modeling and machine learning. Additionally, plasma and peritoneal fluid will be sampled and metabolomically profiled from a mouse peritoneal infection model, with and without antibiotic treatment. These profiles will be used to determine if antibiotics can alter the host metabolism in ways that may affect antibiotic susceptibility at the site of infection. During the independent R00 phase, the effects of host metabolic variation on antibiotic killing will be systematically tested by quantifying antibiotic susceptibility in synthesized media defined by metabolomic profiles from published and measured human and mouse plasma samples. A better understanding of how the host metabolic environment participates in antibiotic treatment fits NIH's public health mission and has direct implications for the clinical management of infectious diseases. Work from the proposed studies will form a quantitative framework for directly evaluating how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatment outcomes and guide improved antibiotic stewardship in clinical practice. Although the applicant has significant expertise in systems biology, this award will provide the applicant research training to gain new experimental skills and an opportunity for continued career training and mentorship from an advisory committee comprised of international leaders in systems biology, metabolomics, chemical biology and infectious diseases. The support and training provided by this award and by the advisory committee will provide the applicant tools and expertise critical to his future independent research program. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): Host variation alters the clinical response to antibiotic treatment for infectious disease, but the pathways underlying differences in patient outcome have not yet all been elucidated. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it is the first systematic investigation of how host metabolites may act on bacterial pathogen metabolism and alter antibiotic susceptibility. This work is relevant to NIH's public health mission by providing a quantitative framework for establishing precision medicine for the treatment of infectious diseases.",Effects of Host Metabolic Variation on Antibiotic Susceptibility,10149339,R00GM118907,"['Affect ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Peritoneal Fluid ', ' Ascitic Fluid ', ' Peritoneal Effusion ', ' Award ', ' Bacteria ', ' Biology ', ' Carbon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Culture Media ', ' growth media ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Environment ', ' Escherichia coli ', ' E coli ', ' E. coli ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunity ', ' In Vitro ', ' Infection ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Mission ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nitrogen ', ' Peritoneal lavage ', ' Peritoneal Irrigation ', ' Phosphorus ', ' P element ', ' Phosphorous ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Sulfur ', ' S element ', ' Testing ', ' Virulence ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Antibiotic Resistance ', ' Resistance to antibiotics ', ' Resistant to antibiotics ', ' antibiotic drug resistance ', ' antibiotic resistant ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' stress response ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Chemicals ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Training ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' insight ', ' Recovery ', ' Biochemical Pathway ', ' Metabolic Networks ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Metabolic ', ' tool ', ' Antibiotic Treatment ', ' bacterial disease treatment ', ' bacterial infectious disease treatment ', ' Antibiotic Therapy ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Peritoneal ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' respiratory ', ' cohort ', ' microbial ', ' skills ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Innovative Therapy ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' resistance to disease ', ' resistant disease ', ' resistant to disease ', ' Disease Resistance ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Research Training ', ' Supplementation ', ' in vivo ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Germ-Free ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' infectious disease treatment ', ' C57BL/6 Mouse ', ' Knock-out ', ' Knockout ', ' Process ', ' Adjuvant ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' bactericide ', ' bactericidal ', ' commensal microbes ', ' commensal flora ', ' commensal microbiota ', ' commensal microflora ', ' Outcome ', ' Antibiotic susceptibility ', ' desensitization ', ' pathogen ', ' pathogenic bacteria ', ' bacteria pathogen ', ' bacterial pathogen ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' overexpression ', ' overexpress ', ' public health relevance ', ' treatment strategy ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' counterscreen ', ' clinical practice ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' bacterial metabolism ', ' bacteria metabolism ', ' Formulation ', ' metabolome ', ' metabonome ', ' ']",NIGMS,RBHS-NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL,R00,2021,249000,NJ-10
"Equipment to facilitate expansion of MMRRC services related to gut microbiota and infectious diseases including SARS-CoV-2 and future infectious agents PROJECT SUMMARY An overarching goal of the Mutant Mouse Resource and Research Center at the University of Missouri (MU- MMRRC) is to optimize and refine mouse models so that biomedical research using these models can proceed rapidly and effectively. The MU-MMRRC also conducts resource-related research, often collaboratively, to further refine and develop mutant mice and capitalize on the power of mouse genetics and associated microbiota for biomedical research. This proposal enhances the capacity of the MU MMRRC to further characterize and refine mouse models through characterization of biological material and enhance our capability to examine the role of infectious disease and the gut microbiome. In the immediate future this equipment will enhance our ongoing and proposed studies of COVID-19. As part of previous supplemental funding, the MU-MMRRC has succeeded in advancing this mouse strain as a model for human COVID-19, characterizing viral growth and the development of acute disease following intranasal and aerosol infection of mice with variations in gut microbiota and prior infection, recapitulating the disease in humans. As new variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerge from human samples the K18-hACE2 mouse will play a key role in evaluating pathogenesis and escape of immunity. As of May of 2021, there have been nearly 32 million survivors of COVID-19 in the United States. As an acute local and systemic inflammatory response is known to cause long-term post-infectious diseases such as chronic pulmonary and neurological diseases, the equipment requested for supplement funding will permit the MU-MMRRC an ability to further characterize and refine the mouse model for the benefit of short- and long-term biomedical research. In addition, this equipment will help the MU-MMRRC expand its ability to phenotype other mouse models in line with its long-term research goals of characterizing and optimizing mouse models by examining the effects of differing microbiota. Current equipment available for use in the BSL3 and ABSL3 laboratories is limited across the nation, effectively slowing COVID-19 research during this pandemic. Expanding the capacity of the BSL3 equipment resources available to analyze infected samples will allow the MU-MMRRC to continue to play a critical role in the biomedical research community and promote studies of pathogenesis for COVID-19. The objective of this proposal is therefore to provide several key pieces of equipment that are expected to be of use not only to COVID-19 researchers, but also provide flexibility to other researchers in the region and nation for studying disease pathogenesis in mouse BSL3 models. The resulting expansion of capabilities will be critical to research on these devastating diseases and on mouse models in general. Crucially, this equipment has use far beyond the pandemic and has been specifically chosen to enhance the parent grant’s research goals during this funding cycle and into future funding cycles. . PROJECT NARRATIVE The Mutant Mouse Resource and Research Center at the University of Missouri (MU-MMRRC) develops tools to optimize and facilitate research using mouse models of disease. These include ongoing research and collaborative studies designed to optimize the understanding of a mouse model of COVID-19 through natural history studies, microbiota manipulation, and development of aerosol inoculation strategies. In this proposal the capabilities of the MMRRC for research within the state-of-the-art biocontainment facilities available at MU will be enhanced through the acquisition of equipment for sensitive, high throughput quantification of infection and disease state. The proposed equipment infrastructure will enhance the impact of the MMRRC and mouse modeling to accelerate our understanding of acute and post-infectious diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and to expand the current value-added services of the MU-MMRRC.",Equipment to facilitate expansion of MMRRC services related to gut microbiota and infectious diseases including SARS-CoV-2 and future

"CMV Dynamics and Transmission Among Pregnant Women Living with HIV PROJECT SUMMARY  Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the leading congenital infection globally, resulting in an enormous burden of childhood hearing loss and neurodevelopmental delay. The 20 million women living with HIV (WLWH) worldwide are more likely to have active CMV replication than women without HIV and are more likely to transmit CMV to the 1.3 million HIV-exposed infants born annually. Combining genome-wide serologic and virologic analyses, this project will use existing samples to new tools to characterize CMV reinfection and shedding during pregnancy. We will also explore the role of specific genotypes among strains causing maternal reinfection and congenital or postnatal infant infections.  Leveraging existing longitudinal samples from 329 WLWH and their children (collected during pregnancy, at delivery, and until 6 weeks postpartum), we will address the following specific aims: 1) Estimate the frequency of CMV reinfection during pregnancy among WLWH using novel serologic methods. 2) Determine the association between reinfection and CMV replication of specific viral strains during pregnancy in WLWH. 3) Identify genotypic features associated with transmission to pregnant women or their children.  Serological profiling will be done using traditional CMV strain-specific antibodies and novel VirScan technology. VirScan allows comprehensive serological profiling using a phage display library that we have adapted to be able to identify all antibodies to all (>10,000) sequenced CMV strains/variants. CMV shedding will be determined by quantitative PCR on maternal & infant saliva and maternal blood & vaginal swabs. CMV genomic analyses will be conducted on PCR positive samples using next-generation sequencing techniques combined with machine learning. The strains present in pregnant women will be characterized and those transmitted to infants will be sequenced. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes that distinguish transmitted from non-transmitted viruses with potential functional significance will be identified. Statistical analyses will evaluate associations between CMV/HIV parameters and outcomes of interest including maternal reinfection and congenital/postnatal infection.  The knowledge gained from this project may result in preventative recommendations for maternal reinfections based on newly elucidated risk factors specific to WLWH, treatment for reinfection during pregnancy, and prevention of congenital infection. Finally, this may help to reduce the enormous burden of CMV infection on families affected by HIV, by informing which CMV genotypes result in CMV transmission and should therefore be included in candidate vaccines.

"Leveraging Neural Imaging for Automated Neonatal Infection Diagnosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Post-infectious hydrocephalus (PIH) is a leading cause of neonate mortality in the developing world, but there are limited resources in place for appropriately diagnosing and monitoring the infections that lead to hydrocephalus. There is often a lack of personnel and laboratory resources available for the gathering and processing of lumbar puncture and blood cultures, which are the gold-standard for diagnosing the infectious agents at play in sepsis and PIH. In order to overcome this obstacle, CSF and blood samples were taken from a cohort of septic neonates in Mbale, Uganda, as well as a cohort of neonates and infants who had already progressed to PIH. Cranial ultrasounds (CrUS) were taken from the cohort of septic neonates, and head CT scans were gathered from the PIH cohort. This proposal hypothesizes that the pathogens determined from RNA and DNA sequencing of the blood and CSF samples can be used to train supervised machine learning algorithms to recognize imaging phenotypes characteristic of the underlying pathogen. Therefore, PIH can be prevented by providing pathogen-specific diagnosis and targeted treatment recommendations at the bedside for septic neonates using CrUS. Furthermore, surgical treatment success for PIH can be optimized using CT for the purpose of identifying the underlying pathogen and providing management plan recommendations. This project provides an ideal training environment for a fellow interested in pediatric neurosurgery with a research emphasis on engineering and machine learning applied to image analysis. The interdisciplinary and global nature of the project encourages development of a collaborative and innovative research approach. The home institution of Penn State provides multiple clinical opportunities for growth in pediatric neurosurgery, the MD/PhD program is supportive of truly translational research efforts, and the sponsor and co-sponsor are more than adequately prepared to provide all aspects of training mentorship necessary to accomplish the aims of this project and develop a well-rounded physician-scientist. PROJECT NARRATIVE Post-infectious hydrocephalus is a devastating condition with a global impact, but diagnostic options and available treatment plans are limited in the developing world in particular. This project aims to design machine learning algorithms that leverage cranial ultrasound and head CT for the diagnosis of pathogen-specific sepsis and hydrocephalus in neonates, and propose treatment

"Impact of early-life perturbations on pediatric microbiome maturation ABSTRACT During the first 3 years of life (YOL) the infant gut microbiome (GM) rapidly diversifies both in structure and function, concomitant with dietary and environmental transitions. Critically, the GM response to specific external stimuli is patient-specific, complicating individualized risk predictions. Healthy GM maturation includes accruing multiple strains of the same species, which frequently differ in key functions. These functional differences, ac- centuated by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and de novo mutations, could resolve conflicting associations of the same species with both health and disease. The rationale behind our proposal is that strain- and species- level variation in bacterial functions drives heterogenous GM responses to early-life (EL) dietary and antibiotic perturbations, which explains, in part, individualized developmental trajectories. This proposal pursues two highly complementary Aims: 1) Define strain-resolved functional maturation of the pediatric gut microbiome and 2) Investigate the acute effects of EL antibiotic (ELA) perturbation on strain dynamics, HGT, and micro- biome maturation in preterm neonates and microbiota-humanized mice. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that EL environmental exposures shape genomic diversification of gut species, causing lasting changes in GM com- munity structure and microbial functions. We will leverage our unique set of 2,436 stools collected over the first 9 YOL from infants variably exposed to dietary and environmental stimuli. By combining culture-enriched meta- genomics, metatranscriptomics, and metabolomics, we will determine taxa-function relationships at the sub-spe- cies level and power statistical models that predict the impact of EL exposures on strain diversification, microbe- function associations, and transcriptional activity. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that ELAs acutely alter strain dynamics and stimulate HGT and that the GM response to ELA can be predicted from baseline composition and function. Here, we will interrogate 160 stools flanking variable ELA exposure in 80 preterm neonates in the first 4 months of life, combining culture-enriched metagenomics with selective culture and isolate sequencing to char- acterize the preterm `plasmidome' and profile post-ELA strain dynamics and HGT. To identify microbiome-intrin- sic responses to ELA, we will utilize an innovative transgenerational mouse model where germ-free dams receive human, preterm, microbiota that is vertically transferred to their pups, which are treated with parenteral antibiot- ics. We will use the resulting data to predict individual GM responses to specific antibiotics based on composition, resistance gene content, and bacterial functions. Our proposal is innovative because our interdisciplinary re- search team will characterize strain-level bacterial functions to understand the heterogeneity of GM responses to EL perturbations on two pre-existing sets of human specimens; it is significant because it will identify features that predict species-resolved GM-specific responses to EL selection. Our work will advance pediatric microbi- ome research by comprehensively characterizing strain-resolved functional maturation and GM disruption to understand individual variation leading towards a future of personalized, microbiome medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed study addresses our gap in understanding how the early life human gut microbiome responds to diet and antibiotics, including impacts on functional maturation and horizontal gene transfer of antibiotic resistance. This research is relevant for public health because it will improve our understanding of the effects of antibiotics and diet on microbiome dynamics beyond the coarse level of microbial communities and establish predictive models for future personalized antibiotic treatment and dietary recommendations that minimize collateral damage and maximize development of the healthy infant microbiome. By complementing data from two unique human cohorts with hypothesis testing in a mouse model this project is relevant to the NIH's mission of leveraging basic research in mechanisms of health and disease to improve outcomes in treatment and maintenance of human health.",Impact of early-life perturbations on pediatric microbiome maturation,10298201,R01AI155893,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', '

"Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry PROJECT SUMMARY  Cellular interactions with the environment form the basis of health and disease for all organisms. Exposure to nutrients, toxins, and neighboring cells trigger coordinated molecular responses that impact cell function and metabolism in a beneficial, adaptive, or detrimental manner. Although the benefits of multicellularity for the formation of complex tissue structures or the function of entire organ systems has been long appreciated, it has only recently been understood that microbial inhabitants of vertebrates also have a tremendous impact on host cell function and dysfunction. Despite this, an understanding of these interactions has not moved beyond simple associations, and there are virtually no molecular technologies available that adequately define how a complex microbial ecosystem impacts host cell function, or how the host response to microbial colonization affects the bacterial community. This gap in knowledge is striking when one considers the broad and significant impact that microbes have on human health. In this application, we propose to expressly fill this knowledge gap through development of a novel multimodal imaging pipeline that will provide 3-dimensional information on the molecular heterogeneity of microbial communities and the immune response at the host-pathogen interface.  This proposal combines our expertise in immunology, infection biology, mass spectrometry, small animal imaging, machine learning, and computer vision to develop an integrated multimodal visualization method for studying infectious disease. Our unique approach will computationally combine ultra-high speed (~50px/s) MALDI-TOF images, ultra-high mass resolution (>200,000 resolving power) MALDI FTICR IMS, metal imaging by LA-ICP-IMS, high-spatial resolution optical microscopy, and MR imaging using data-driven image fusion. This strategy will enable 3-D molecular images to be generated for thousands of elements, metabolites, lipids, and proteins with an unprecedented combination of chemical specificity and spatial fidelity more than 50x faster than is currently possible. We will use this next-generation imaging capability to (i) define the heterogeneous microbial subpopulations throughout the 3-D volume of a S. aureus community, (ii) uncover the host molecules that form the abscess and accumulate to restrict microbial growth in murine models, and (iii) elucidate molecular markers that differentiate in vivo biofilms at the host-pathogen interface, between abscesses at various stages of progression, and under distinct degrees of nutrient stress. These studies will uncover new targets for therapeutic intervention and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will enable detailed views of the molecular components of infectious disease with unprecedented resolution through the development of a multimodal, 3-dimensional imaging platform. The proposed technologies will improve throughput and molecular specificity, enable automated high-precision and high-accuracy image alignment, and allow for descriptions of molecular signals in 3-D through the fusion of multi-modal imaging data. These studies will uncover targets for therapeutic intervention and antibiotic development and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically

"Consortium for Immunotherapeutics against Emerging Viral Threats SUMMARY: OVERALL  This proposal, Consortium for Immunotherapeutics Against Emerging Viral Diseases, addresses a critical gap in the biodefense portfolio by building an academic-industry partnership to advance effective, fully human, antibody-based immunotherapeutics against three major families of emerging/re-emerging viruses: Lassa virus, Ebola and other Filoviruses, and mosquito-transmitted Alphaviruses that threaten millions worldwide. This program follows directly from our significant body of preliminary data (the largest available for these families of viruses), therapeutics in hand, multidisciplinary expertise, and demonstrated collaborative success. Included in the proposed CETR portfolio are: (1) the only available immunotherapeutics against endemic Lassa virus, with reversal of late-stage disease and complete survival in infected non-human primates, (2) novel Ebola and pan- ebolavirus therapeutics that also completely protect non-human primates from disease, and that were built by the paradigm-shifting and comprehensive analysis of a global consortium, and (3) much needed, first-in-class therapeutics against the re-emerging alphaviruses that have tremendous epidemic potential in the United States and around the globe. These multidisciplinary studies, founded upon pioneering structural biology of the antigen targets, include innovations such as agnostic, high-throughput Fc profiling and optimization, coupled with Fv evolution to enhance potency and developability, as well as a sophisticated statistical and computational analysis core to evaluate thresholds and correlates of protection across the major families of pathogens. Together, we aim to understand what findings represent general rules and what data are specific to each virus family. We also aim to provide streamlined systems for antibody choice and optimization that do not yet exist, and to build a broadly applicable platform for mAb discovery and delivery against any novel pathogen as they emerge. The recent resurgence of Lassa, the epidemic nature of Ebola virus and other re-emerging filoviruses, as well as the major population at risk by global movement of mosquito-borne alphaviruses together demonstrate the tremendous global need for immunotherapeutics developed and advanced by this program. NARRATIVE Three major families of emerging viruses (Lassa and other arenaviruses, Ebola and other filoviruses, and mosquito-borne alphaviruses) threaten human health worldwide, but lack approved therapeutics or vaccines. The proposed multidisciplinary consortium, an academic-industry partnership, will advance safe and effective, fully human, monoclonal antibody therapies against these viruses, using candidate therapies that confer complete protection in non-human primates as our starting point. Our collaborative databases, multivariate analyses and innovative antibody optimization strategies will establish platforms for discovery and delivery of much-needed treatments against these and other infectious diseases.",Consortium for Immunotherapeutics against Emerging Viral Threats,10158446,U19AI142790,"['Alphavirus ', ' Alpha Virus ', ' Group A Arboviruses ', ' Antibodies ', ' Monoclonal Antibodies ', ' Clinical Treatment Moab ', ' mAbs ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' chikungunya ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' developing country ', ' developing nation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Ebola virus ', ' EBOV ', ' Ebola-like Viruses ', ' ebolavirus ', ' Epidemic ', ' Evolution ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lassa virus ', ' Lassa fever virus ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Culicidae ', ' Mosquitoes ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Multivariate Analysis ', ' Multivariate Analyses ', ' Reagent ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Talents ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Vaccines ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' viral infection ', ' virus infection ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' Virus ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Arenavirus ', ' Arenaviridae ', ' Arenavirus group ', ' Filovirus ', ' Filoviridae ', ' insight ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' Fostering ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Primate Diseases ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Monoclonal Antibody Therapy ', ' mAb therapy ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' developed country ', ' developed nation ', ' developed nations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' experience ', ' structural biology ', ' success ', ' synergism ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' immune drugs ', ' immune-based therapeutics ', ' immunologic preparation ', ' immunologic therapeutics ', ' immunotherapeutics ', ' immunotherapy agent ', ' Immunotherapeutic agent ', ' biodefense ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Antigen Targeting ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' pandemic disease ', ' pandemic ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' pathogen ', ' human monoclonal antibodies ', ' Hu-mABs ', ' humAbs ', ' human mAbs ', ' human monoclonals ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies ', ' MAb Therapeutics ', ' monoclonal antibody drugs ', ' therapeutic mAbs ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' industry partner ', ' industrial partnership ', ' industry partnership ', ' clinical development ', ' Arthritogenic ', ' mosquito-borne ', ' mosquitoborne ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Ebola ', ' emerging pathogen ', ' new pathogen ', ' novel pathogen ', ' ']",NIAID,LA JOLLA INSTITUTE FOR IMMUNOLOGY,U19,2021,7065330,CA-52
"Optimization of efflux avoidance and inhibition for antibiotic development Project Summary Failures of antibiotic therapy occur with increasing frequency in clinics due to the spread of multidrug resistant bacterial pathogens. The major challenge are infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria that are protected from antibiotics by the concerted action of multidrug efflux pumps and the low permeability barrier of outer membranes. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic human pathogen responsible for a variety of infectious diseases, is notorious for its antibiotic impermeability. A handful of clinical antibiotics used against this pathogen are beginning to fail due to the emergence of multidrug resistant strains. New antibiotics are needed to address this growing threat. Decades of antibiotic discovery and optimization perfected empirical approaches for improvement of antibiotic action and avoidance of class-specific resistance mechanisms. The current critical challenge is to develop approaches that will enable antibiotic penetration across non-specific permeability barriers of Gram-negative bacteria, which present an urgent and serious threat to public health. This project responds to this challenge and proposes the development of a new technology for optimization of efflux avoidance and inhibition in clinical and investigational antibacterial agents that will be effective against Gram-negative bacteria. The proposed approach targets simultaneously the multidrug efflux mechanism of P. aeruginosa and its outer membrane barrier and combines cutting edge technologies in experimental analyses of efflux inhibition and drug penetration, kinetic modeling of drug accumulation, computer simulations of drug efflux and transmembrane diffusion, synthetic chemistry and machine learning analyses. The central objective of the proposal is to create a mechanism-based predictive model that integrates physicochemical properties of compounds, kinetics of their intracellular accumulation and transmembrane diffusion, and a molecular level description of the interaction of efflux transporters with their substrates and inhibitors. The model will be validated by focused medicinal chemistry efforts to generate antibacterial agents that combine the traits of effective antibiotics and potent efflux pump inhibitors or avoiders. This multi-disciplinary approach is enabled by the collaborative efforts of PIs on the project: Helen Zgurskaya (biochemistry of drug uptake and efflux), Valentin Rybenkov (kinetic modeling), Paolo Ruggerone (computational biophysics of efflux), Gnanakaran (computational simulations of membrane permeation) and John Walker (medicinal chemistry). Narrative This project addresses a current critical challenge in the discovery and development of antibiotics effective against multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These studies will create a new powerful technology for accelerated antibiotic development targeting diverse bacteria and give rise to new families of antibiotics.",Optimization of efflux avoidance and inhibition for antibiotic development,10094184,R01AI136799,"['inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Bacteria ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Pharmaceutical Chemistry ', ' Medicinal Chemistry ', ' Pharmaceutic Chemistry ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' computational simulation ', ' computerized simulation ', ' Diffusion ', ' Drug Modelings ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Family ', ' Gram-Negative Bacteria ', ' Infection ', ' Kinetics ', ' Libraries ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Permeability ', ' Pseudomonas aeruginosa ', ' P aeruginosa ', ' P. aeruginosa ', ' Pseudomonas pyocyanea ', ' Public Health ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Technology ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Walkers ', ' Measures ', ' Antibiotic Resistance ', ' Resistance to antibiotics ', ' Resistant to antibiotics ', ' antibiotic drug resistance ', ' antibiotic resistant ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Penetration ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Multi-Drug Resistance ', ' Multidrug Resistance ', ' Multiple Drug Resistance ', ' Multiple Drug Resistant ', ' Resistance to Multi-drug ', ' Resistance to Multidrug ', ' Resistance to Multiple Drug ', ' Resistant to Multiple Drug ', ' Resistant to multi-drug ', ' Resistant to multidrug ', ' multi-drug resistant ', ' multidrug resistant ', ' uptake ', ' Anti-Bacterial Agents ', ' Antibacterial Agents ', ' anti-bacterial ', ' antibacterial ', ' tool ', ' Antibiotic Treatment ', ' bacterial disease treatment ', ' bacterial infectious disease treatment ', ' Antibiotic Therapy ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' computer biology ', ' Computational Biology ', ' Frequencies ', ' Clinic ', ' experience ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' Molecular Dynamics Simulation ', ' molecular dynamics ', ' success ', ' cell envelope ', ' trait ', ' Molecular Modeling Nucleic Acid Biochemistry ', ' Molecular Modeling Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Molecular Models ', ' molecular modeling ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Drug Efflux ', ' Synthesis Chemistry ', ' Synthetic Chemistry ', ' Molecular ', ' resistance mechanism ', ' resistant mechanism ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' antibiotic efflux ', ' antibiotic export ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' pathogen ', ' pathogenic bacteria ', ' bacteria pathogen ', ' bacterial pathogen ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' experimental analysis ', ' efflux pump ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' resistant strain ', ' resistance strain ', ' industry partner ', ' industrial partnership ', ' industry partnership ', ' clinical investigation ', ' multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa ', ' MDR P aeruginosa ', ' MDR P. aeruginosa ', ' MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa ', ' multi-drug resistant P. aeruginosa ', ' multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa ', ' multidrug resistant P. aeruginosa ', ' multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa ', ' human pathogen ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' kinetic model ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA NORMAN,R01,2021,1106111,OK-04
"Measuring spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This proposed K01 award will support the career development of Dr. Jade Benjamin-Chung, an Epidemiologist in the Division of Epidemiology & Biostatistics at the University of California (UC), Berkeley. Dr. Benjamin- Chung’s career goal is to become a leader in the application of rigorous biostatistical methods to infectious disease control and elimination. To support her career development, this application proposes a study she will lead to fill an important gap in research on malaria elimination interventions. As malaria transmission declines it becomes more heterogeneous and is characterized by focal hot spots of transmission. Blanket coverage of interventions becomes impractical and is not cost-effective. Reactive, focal interventions target hot spots by delivering antimalarials to people residing near to a symptomatic malaria case that presents to a surveillance site. Focally delivered interventions aim to reduce transmission to those outside focal treatment zones, including to asymptomatic malaria cases, who are thought to be responsible for the majority of transmission in elimination settings. Thus, information about whether interventions reduce illness among intervention recipients (“direct effects”) vs. non-intervention recipients in intervention clusters (i.e., “spillover effects”) is critical to understanding whether these interventions can eliminate malaria, yet current studies have not estimated such spillover effects. This study will estimate site-specific and pooled direct effects and spillover effects in three cluster-randomized trials of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions in low malaria transmission settings in Namibia, Swaziland, and Zambia. The specific aims are to (1) estimate direct effects and spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions on Plasmodium falciparum malaria incidence and prevalence and (2) assess whether direct effects and spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions vary by distance to intervention, intervention coverage, and time from incident case detection. Evidence of spillover effects would suggest that reactive, focal interventions hold promise for malaria elimination when scaled up. The absence of spillover effects would suggest that interventions did not interrupt transmission; if so, information about the spatial configuration of infections would inform who and how many people to treat using redesigned interventions. This study will apply novel machine learning-based methods for estimation of causal effects appropriate for infectious disease data. This application proposes a 4-year training plan including mentorship from two leading biostatisticians at UC Berkeley and two malaria epidemiologists at UC San Francisco. Dr. Benjamin-Chung’s training goals are to (1) develop skills in machine learning and causal inference methods for dependent data, (2) learn about malaria biology and epidemiology, and (3) enhance her software development and spatial analysis skills. UC Berkeley is the optimal place for Dr. Benjamin-Chung to advance her career goals because of its leading faculty in biostatistics, strong track record of research and teaching in infectious diseases and biostatistics, and close proximity to UCSF’s Malaria Elimination Initiative. PROJECT NARRATIVE To inform global efforts to eliminate malaria in resource-limited settings, an active area of research evaluates whether targeted interventions delivered to malaria cases recently seen at local clinics and their neighbors can halt transmission in low endemic settings. This study will use novel statistical methods to measure whether these reactive, focal interventions (presumptive treatment with antimalarials and indoor residual spraying) in Namibia, Swaziland, and Zambia can reduce transmission of Plasmodium falciparum from intervention recipients to non-recipients in nearby areas – i.e., whether interventions produce spillover effects, evidence of which would indicate that these interventions hold promise for malaria elimination. Information about the magnitude of spillover effects and the distribution of spillover effects over space, time, and intervention coverage level will inform whether reactive, focal interventions hold promise for malaria elimination when scaled up or whether interventions require modification; the methods developed in this study will form a template that can be used in other trials of focal interventions for malaria or other infectious diseases.","Measuring spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions",10203751,K01AI141616,"['Affect ', ' Antimalarials ', ' Anti-Malarials ', ' Antimalarial Agents ', ' Antimalarial Drugs ', ' anti-malarial agents ', ' anti-malarial drugs ', ' Award ', ' Biology ', ' Biomass ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' California ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Filarial Elephantiases ', ' Bancroftian Elephantiasis ', ' Lymphatic Filariasis ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Insecticides ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Malaria ', ' Paludism ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Falciparum Malaria ', ' Plasmodium falciparum Malaria ', ' Maps ', ' Masks ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Culicidae ', ' Mosquitoes ', ' Namibia ', ' South West Africa ', ' Southwest Africa ', ' Onchocerciasis ', ' onchocercosis ', ' volvulosis ', ' Parasites ', ' Plasmodium falciparum ', ' P falciparum ', ' P. falciparum ', ' P.falciparum ', ' Poliomyelitis ', ' Acute Poliomyelitis ', ' Polio ', ' Public Health ', ' Reaction Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Response Time ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' San Francisco ', ' Smallpox ', ' Variola ', ' small pox ', ' variola major ', ' Swaziland ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Trachoma ', ' Tuberculosis ', ' M tuberculosis infection ', ' M. tb infection ', ' M. tuberculosis infection ', ' M.tb infection ', ' M.tuberculosis infection ', ' MTB infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection ', ' TB infection ', ' disseminated TB ', ' disseminated tuberculosis ', ' infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' tuberculosis infection ', ' tuberculous spondyloarthropathy ', ' Universities ', ' Vaccination ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Zambia ', ' Northern Rhodesia ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Country ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' disease control ', ' disorder control ', ' Biostatistical Methods ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Interruption ', ' K01 Award ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Program ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Hot Spot ', ' Modification ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Anti-malarial drug resistance ', ' Anti-malarial drug resistant ', ' Antimalarial drug resistance ', ' Antimalarial drug resistant ', ' anti-malarial resistance ', ' antimalarial resistance ', ' resistance to anti-malarial drug ', ' resistance to antimalarial drug ', ' resistant to anti-malarial drug ', ' resistant to antimalarial drug ', ' infectious disease model ', ' Prevalence ', ' migration ', ' chemotherapy ', ' trial comparing ', ' Cluster randomized trial ', ' Cluster randomization trial ', ' malaria transmission ', ' low income country ', ' treatment arm ', ' intervention arm ', ' ']",NIAID,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2021,146767,CA-18
"Maximizing Investigators' Research Award (R35) PROJECT SUMMARY The “Tools for Transmission of Agents and Conditions (TRAC)” program will synergize statistical and mathematical modeling work in three areas of application: 1) Tuberculosis (TB) incidence and transmission; 2) monitoring substance use disorder (SUD) patterns; and 3) SARS CoV-2 transmission modeling. These three conditions are major public health problems, with TB being the leading cause of infectious disease death globally, SUD causing more deaths in the United States than HIV/AIDS in its peak, and SARS CoV-2 causing a pandemic with societal disruption and mortality exceeding anything we have experienced in the last century. We need improved analytical tools that leverage existing data to monitor these diseases, infer transmission hot spots, determine the efficacy of interventions, and understand the burden of these conditions. This program will bring together an expert group of quantitative researchers with skills that are readily applied to these problems. We also leverage our strong collaborations with clinician researchers and public health officials to ensure that the methods we develop are addressing important questions and consistent with our current understanding of these diseases. By creating a program to facilitate communication between these experts, we will enable greater innovation in modeling key aspects of these diseases and create exciting methodological synergies across diseases. Our team is well positioned to incorporate data from emerging technologies, including high throughput sequencing data to determine TB risk signatures and inform transmission links for TB and SARS CoV-2. Our expertise in machine learning, a broad range of statistical methodologies, and mathematical modeling will enable us to leverage the rich information in large databases that are emerging to better understand SUD patterns and identify risk signatures. We will also build infrastructure with our partners to make the analytical tools that we develop more accessible to public health practitioners and other researchers. The impact of this work is to develop a suite of analytical tools that leverage rapidly emerging rich data sets to improve our understanding of disease transmission patterns, monitor changing dynamics of these conditions, and understand intervention strategies that are most effective. This work will inform public health practice for these diseases and create reproducible tools that can be used in an ongoing way. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will generate analytical tools to address three major public health challenges: 1) Tuberculosis, 2) Substance use disorders, and 3) SARS CoV-2. These tools will improve our understanding of the transmission patterns of these diseases, advance our ability to monitor them, and inform intervention strategies.

"Regulation of Cell Death and Inflammation by ISG15 during SARS-CoV2 Infection SARS-CoV2 is a highly contagious, novel human coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Currently over 7.4 million people in the US have confirmed infection with SARS-CoV2 and over 215,000 have died. Severe COVID-19 is characterized by pulmonary and systemic inflammation and multi-organ dysfunction, which disproportionally affects elderly patients. The mechanism by which SARS-CoV2 triggers such severe pathogenesis is poorly understood. Recent clinical studies have suggested that cell death, especially the induction of necroptosis, may be predictor of severe COVID-19 disease. The mechanism by which the host restricts necroptosis is unclear. In the preliminary data we have shown that the interferon induced protein, ISG15, acts as a negative regulator of necroptosis and its downstream inflammatory responses during viral infection. In this proposal we will test the hypothesis that SARS-CoV2 induces necroptosis and that ISG15 functions as a negative regulator of necroptosis in respiratory epithelial cells. We will use in vitro primary tracheal epithelial cultures (hTECs) and an in vivo mouse adapted SARS-CoV2 animal model to ask several questions including: 1) Does SARS- CoV2 induce necroptosis in respiratory epithelial cells; 2) Does ISG15 modulate necroptotic cell death as well as proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine production in respiratory epithelial cells during SARS-CoV2 infection?; 3) Does necroptosis and its regulation by ISG15 contribute to SARS-CoV2 pathogenesis? Overall, our studies will provide important insight into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV2 infection and provide potential insight into mechanisms underlying severe disease, which may direct efforts toward the development of diagnostic markers and future countermeasures. SARS-CoV-2 is a highly contagious, novel human coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which has resulted in severe morbidity and mortality. It remains unclear why certain populations, particularly the elderly, are more susceptible to severe COVID-19 symptoms. The goal of this work is to determine whether excessive inflammatory cell death, regulated by ISG15 and RIPK3, acts as a key factor in severe COVID-19 disease.",Regulation of Cell Death and

"Enteric Pathogen Force of Infection among Children using Serology Enteric pathogen infections are a leading cause of the global disease burden, with the largest burden among children in low-resource settings. Stool-based PCR methods have dramatically improved our ability to measure enteric infections, but the challenge of collecting stool and need for near-continuous monitoring to detect many globally important pathogens has thwarted broader use in large-scale surveillance. Large-scale, population- based surveys now regularly collect blood to monitor transmission and burden of diseases such as HIV, malaria and dengue. Broader testing of blood collected in such surveys with multiplex assays represents a new opportunity to measure enteric pathogen transmission and burden. Antibody-based measures could complement stool-based PCR testing because antibody responses remain elevated for many months after infection, thus providing more information in studies with infrequent measurements. Our team has developed multiplex bead assays that measure immunoglobulin G (IgG) response to diverse enteric pathogens. In preliminary studies we have shown that IgG levels can be used to measure heterogeneity in enteric pathogen transmission between populations. We have also shown the results generalize to pathogens that span taxa. In this application, we propose to complete a series of studies that address key next steps to advance the seroepidemiology of enteric pathogens in low-resource settings. We will conduct a longitudinal birth cohort in Ecuador that pairs high resolution, multiplex stool-based PCR infection with longitudinal, multiplex IgG and IgA measurements. Our 17- year research history at the site has documented substantial variation in enteric pathogen infection across a rural-urban gradient, making it an ideal setting for the research. The cohort will enroll 600 children from three sites across a rural-urban gradient, and measure them frequently from birth to 24 months. On the Luminex platform, we will pair multiplex PCR assessment for 15 enteric pathogens with IgG and IgA assessment in a multiplex bead assay that includes antigens to 7 enteric pathogens: Campylobacter jejuni, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Giardia duodenalis, Cryptosporidium parvum, Entamoeba histolytica, and norovirus. In Aim 1, we will use molecular and antibody-based measures to study force of infection of the enteric pathogens across a rural-urban gradient. This will represent the first broad-based comparison of seroepidemiologic measures against patent infection for enterics. In Aim 2, we will estimate enteric pathogen force of infection by applying current-status models to population-based, cross-sectional serology surveys in the region, and will benchmark the cross-sectional estimates against those obtained in the concurrent longitudinal study. In Aim 3, we will study IgG and IgA kinetics following infection for each of the 7 pathogens, and develop models to accurately predict recent infections and incidence from antibody levels measured in cross-sectional serology surveys. Completion of these aims will result in generalizable seroepidemiologic methods that have the potential to transform measurement of enteric pathogen transmission and burden in low-resource settings. Project Narrative / Lay Language Description Pathogens that cause diarrheal disease account for an immense global public health burden, primarily among young children in low-resource settings. The use of antibodies to study the epidemiology of diarrhea-causing pathogens has potential to improve our measurement of pathogen transmission in research and surveillance. This project will advance the epidemiologic methods used to measure diarrhea-causing pathogen exposure at the population level, by completing the first comprehensive study that pairs antibody-based and stool-based measures of infection among a birth cohort living across a rural-urban gradient in Ecuador.",Enteric Pathogen Force of Infection among Children using

"Computational and Experimental Resources for Virome Analysis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (CERVAID) SUMMARY  While the role of the bacterial microbiome in human health and disease is well established, few studies have evaluated the contribution of the virome. Recently, we demonstrated that alterations in the enteric virome in adulthood are associated with diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and AIDS. In a cross- sectional comparison of IBD cases and household controls, a significant expansion of the Caudovirales, an order of phages, and anelloviruses, a family of eukaryotic DNA viruses, was observed. Advancing understanding of the IBD virome beyond this finding is limited by: (1) A lack of well defined longitudinal human cohorts to enable discovery of temporal associations of the virome with health and disease; (2) The challenge of viral “dark matter”. Dark matter refers to the typically >50% of the sequences present in purified virus preparations cannot be classified due to a lack of statistically significant alignment to known reference sequences. Thus, current virome studies effectively assess < 50% of the virome, thereby compromising our ability to detect important associations between the virome and disease; (3) Inadequate experimental systems to manipulate the virome. Although sequencing has identified many novel eukaryotic viruses, there are only cell culture systems for a limited number of viruses; moreover, there are no small animal infection models for newly described viruses. In addition while a tremendous diversity of phage has been identified, only a tiny fraction have known hosts and an even smaller fraction has been cultured. Thus, there are significant barriers that must be overcome to be able to experimentally test the impact of either eukaryotic viruses or phages in murine IBD models. These barriers to understanding the role of the IBD virome will be addressed as follows: Aim 1 will define the enteric virome and bacterial microbiome in a longitudinal cohort of IBD patients and household controls and identify virome associations with IBD. In Aim 2 novel computational tools to identify and characterize viruses present in enteric viromes will be developed, including approaches to classify dark matter. In Aim 3 novel experimental systems for functional virome analysis, including novel cultures of both eukaryotic viruses and phages as well as animal infection models, will be developed with the end goal of evaluating causal roles for the viruses and phage in existing muring IBD models. Together, these Aims will not only address significant barriers in understanding of IBD, but will provide a wealth of tangible computational and experimental resources to advance the general field of virome studies.   NARRATIVE The overall goal of this project is to develop novel computational and experimental tools to address challenges in understanding the role of viruses in inflammatory bowel disease. These tools will facilitate studies of not only inflammatory bowel disease, but also broader studies of the relationship of the human virome to other diseases.  ",Computational and Experimental Resources for Virome Analysis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (CERVAID),10246192,RC2DK116713,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Animals ', ' Bacteria ', ' Bacterial Infections ', ' bacteria infection ', ' bacterial disease ', ' Bacteriophages ', ' Phages ', ' bacterial virus ', ' Biology ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' cell culture ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Digestive System Disorders ', ' Digestive Diseases ', ' Digestive System Diseases ', ' GI tract disorder ', ' digestive disorder ', ' digestive tract disease ', ' gastrointestinal tract disease ', ' gastrointestinal tract disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA Viruses ', ' Family ', ' Feces ', ' stool ', ' Viral Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Gnotobiotic ', ' Gnotobiotics ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Disorder ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Ribosomal RNA ', ' rRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Viral Genome ', ' virus genome ', ' virology ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' viral infection ', ' virus infection ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' Virus ', ' Open Reading Frames ', ' ORFs ', ' Protein Coding Region ', ' Taxonomy ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' bacterial resistance ', ' Bacteria resistance ', ' Bacteria resistant ', ' Bacterial resistant ', ' resistance to Bacteria ', ' resistance to Bacterial ', ' resistant to Bacteria ', ' resistant to Bacterial ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Caudovirales ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' sequence database ', ' sequencing database ', ' molecular sequence database ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' microbial ', ' novel ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' parasite infection ', ' Parasitic infection ', ' Modeling ', ' case control ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Norwalk-like Viruses ', ' Norovirus ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Enteric ', ' Enteral ', ' Address ', ' Defect ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' Resource Development ', ' Cell Culture System ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Preparation ', ' protein function ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' metagenome ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' Population ', ' virome ', ' viral microbiome ', ' human virome ', ' experimental analysis ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Metagenomics ', ' Functional Metagenomics ', ' genome annotation ', ' High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing ', ' High-Throughput Sequencing ', ' dark matter ', ' phenomenological models ', ' phenomenology ', ' gut microbiome ', ' GI microbiome ', ' digestive tract microbiome ', ' enteric microbiome ', ' gastrointestinal microbiome ', ' gut-associated microbiome ', ' intestinal biome ', ' intestinal microbiome ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' bacteriome ', ' bacterial microbiome ', ' stool sample ', ' stool specimen ', ' contig ', ' enteric virus infection ', ' enteric viral infection ', ' ']",NIDDK,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,RC2,2021,1809005,MO-01
"Dissecting host-pathogen interactions through the lens of genomics Summary: Dissecting host-pathogen interactions through the lens of genomics Current investigation of mechanisms underlying many diseases relies on the acquisition of multi-dimensional genomics data. The utility of these data is, however, offset by the lag in development of tools and models to fully interrogate them. In the context of infectious diseases, such data contains molecular information including gene transcription, regulation, and variations from both the infecting pathogen and the host cell, providing a snapshot of the host and pathogen interactions (HPIs). These HPIs determine infection outcomes. For instance, when a pathogen evades, or evolves resistance to defensive host immunity via a multifaceted HPI, it can result in persisting infection, chronic inflammation, malignant transformation, and/or elevated mortality. Recent successes in overcoming immune-evasion of infected tumor cells with checkpoint inhibitors exemplifies the clinical gains that can be made by identifying and specifically targeting essential mechanisms of HPIs. Hence, precisely identifying new mode(s) of HPIs is critical for development of effective and personalized interventions. The molecular mechanisms of HPIs underpinning disease can be identified from genomics data. For example, information on whether a transcription factor (TF) regulates genes from either host or pathogen, or both, can be captured by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing of infected host cells. This means that integrative analysis of genome-scale data can provide a platform for large-scale and unbiased detection of often multi- dimensional and novel facets of HPIs in host cells. However, there is a lack of data mining tools and models to extract such information. More importantly, the available analysis tools typically focus on data from either the host or the pathogen and not on the interactions occurring between the two, excluding us from investigating the full HPI spectrum. Thus, novel methods to determine HPIs by simultaneously modeling both host and pathogen data are critical for understanding key cellular mechanisms and developing treatment strategies. My lab specializes in developing computational models to construct HPI maps and to experimentally validate them. As proof-of-principle, we produced a comprehensive HPI map from sequencing samples from large numbers of tumors caused by Epstein–Barr virus. This map delivered unprecedented insights, identifying novel viral integrations, mutations linked to viral reactivation and providing molecular classification of tumors expected to yield individualized cancer therapy. Therefore, my lab is uniquely positioned to uncover mechanistic insights from HPIs. Our program seeks to develop new models and machine learning tools to construct HPI maps in several diseases by focusing on the following major questions: 1) how do expression, integration, and mutational landscapes of host and pathogen affect pathogenesis of disease?; 2) what is the nature of physical HPIs and cross-regulation by major host and pathogen factors that modulate gene expression, such as TFs and RNA binding proteins?; 3) how do HPIs define molecular subtypes to guide personalized treatments? We expect to identify novel HPIs and provide systems-level understanding of mechanisms critical to cell biology. Narrative Understanding how host cells and pathogens interact is key to developing new and individualized therapeutics. Here, we will develop novel computational tools and models to analyze existing and newly generated high throughput data and construct multi-dimensional host pathogen interaction maps. These maps will provide detailed mechanisms underpinning multi-faceted interactions occurring between host and pathogen and will delineate molecular subtypes that can be utilized for novel and personalized treatment options.",Dissecting host-pathogen interactions through the lens of genomics,10241946,R35GM138283,"['Affect ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Human Herpesvirus 4 ', ' Burkitt Herpesvirus ', ' Burkitt Lymphoma Virus ', ' E-B Virus ', ' EB virus ', ' EBV ', ' Epstein Barr Virus ', ' HHV-4 ', ' HHV4 ', ' Infectious Mononucleosis Virus ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Immunity ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA-Binding Proteins ', ' Virus Integration ', ' viral integration ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Malignant ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' cell biology ', ' Cellular biology ', ' Investigation ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' Tumor Cell ', ' neoplastic cell ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting Initiative ', ' Molecular Profiling Initiative ', ' Molecular Classification of Tumors ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' Outcome ', ' pathogen ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' tool development ', ' tumor ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' effective intervention ', ' treatment strategy ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' genome analysis ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' personalized cancer therapy ', ' individualized cancer therapy ', ' personalized cancer treatment ', ' molecular subtypes ', ' expression subtypes ', ' molecular sub-types ', ' molecular subsets ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' Immune Evasion ', ' Immune checkpoint inhibitor ', ' Checkpoint inhibitor ', ' immune check point inhibitor ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NIGMS,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,381824,IN-04
"Non-Invasive Single-Cell Morphometry and Tracking in Living Bacterial Biofilms Project Summary/Abstract  Biofilms are cohesive, multicellular microbial communities that are able to adhere to biotic or abiotic surfaces. The human microbiome contains numerous biofilm-forming bacterial species that help maintain normal human physiology. On the other hand, more than half of the 1.7 million hospital-acquired infections in the US are caused by biofilm-forming bacterial pathogens. The biofilm lifestyle is advantageous, because phenotypic diversity and coordination of cellular behaviors within biofilms provide bacterial populations with emergent capabilities beyond those of individual cells. For example, biofilms are orders of magnitude more tolerant towards physical, chemical, and biological stressors, most notably long-term treatments with antibiotic drugs or clearance attempts by the immune system. However, it remains largely unknown how such remarkable capabilities emerge from the behaviors of individual cells and the interactions between them. A critical barrier to rapid progress is the inability of conventional microscopes to resolve micrometer-sized bacterial cells in thick (>10 micrometers) biofilms in a non-invasive manner. The proposed research addresses this challenge by developing integrated experimental and computational technologies that enable non-invasive, 3D fluorescence imaging of pathogenic biofilms by lattice-light sheet microscopy, accurate single-cell segmentation and 3D shape measurements based on the acquired images, and simultaneous 3D tracking of thousands of cells inside biofilms. The ability to make single- cell measurements in dense microbial populations will enable researchers to correlate the spatial trajectory of each cell with that cells’ gene expression and behavioral phenotype. Such information will provide an integrated understanding of how bacteria coordinate gene expression and social behaviors in 3D space and time. A fundamental understanding of biofilm biology will help inform new strategies for harnessing the emergent functional capabilities of microbial populations and for removing pathogenic biofilms from undesired environments. Project Narrative - Public Health Relevance  Bacterial biofilms are responsible for a large number of hospital-acquired infections, and currently used antibiotic and disinfection treatments are unable to cope with this epidemic. An integrated understanding of how individual bacterial cells act and interact with each other inside biofilms is necessary to inform new strategies for controlling biofilm growth. This project enables high-resolution, single-cell measurements inside living biofilms by developing new technologies for non-invasive biofilm imaging and computational tracking of thousands of bacterial cells in crowded environments.",Non-Invasive Single-Cell Morphometry and Tracking in Living Bacterial Biofilms,10247048,R01GM139002,"['Algorithms ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Bacteria ', ' Bacterial Infections ', ' bacteria infection ', ' bacterial disease ', ' Behavior ', ' Biology ', ' Cell Communication ', ' Cell Interaction ', ' Cell-to-Cell Interaction ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Crowding ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disinfection ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Escherichia coli ', ' E coli ', ' E. coli ', ' Eukaryotic Cell ', ' Exhibits ', ' Gene Activation ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Industrialization ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Microscopy ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Linear Programming ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' seal ', ' Shigella flexneri ', ' S flexneri ', ' S. flexneri ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' United States ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Measures ', ' Microbial Biofilms ', ' biofilm ', ' Myxococcus xanthus ', ' M xanthus ', ' M. xanthus ', ' Custom ', ' Cell Shape ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' Microscope ', ' morphometry ', ' Surface ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Nosocomial Infections ', ' Hospital Infections ', ' Hospital acquired infection ', ' institutional infection ', ' Reporter Genes ', ' Chemicals ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Shapes ', ' Reporter ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' environmental stresses ', ' environmental stressor ', ' stressor ', ' cohesion ', ' microbial ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Property ', ' model design ', ' cell dimension ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Resolution ', ' Sum ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cellular imaging ', ' cell imaging ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Human Microbiome ', ' human-associated microbiome ', ' pathogenic bacteria ', ' bacteria pathogen ', ' bacterial pathogen ', ' Population ', ' microbial community ', ' community microbes ', ' cell behavior ', ' cellular behavior ', ' fluorescence imaging ', ' fluorescent imaging ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' public health relevance ', ' Geometry ', ' imaging platform ', ' temporal measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' live cell imaging ', ' live cell image ', ' live cellular image ', ' live cellular imaging ', ' high resolution imaging ', ' antibiotic tolerance ', ' tolerance to antibiotics ', ' tolerate antibiotics ', ' bacterial community ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' human pathogen ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Immersion ', ' behavioral phenotyping ', ' behavior phenotype ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2021,302199,VA-05

"Phospholipid antimetabolite lipid ether amines for topical treatment of chronic wounds and associated biofilms. ABSTRACT Chronic wounds affect over 2.5 million patients in the US alone, lasting on average 12-13 months and recurring in 60-70% of patients. These occur primarily in lower extremities and vascular disease, diabetes, nephropathy, and metabolic dysfunction are prevalent co-morbidities. These wounds frequently harbor bacterial infections as mixed Gram-negative (e.g. P. aeruginosa, PA) and Gram-positive biofilms (e.g. S. aureus, SA), conferring resistance to antibiotic therapy and inhibiting resolution. The heterogenous biofilm barrier, composed of lipids, proteins, and polysaccharides, presents a robust physiochemical barrier and substrate for persistent infection. Transition of planktonic bacteria to the distinct biofilm state requires a suitable substrate for specific adhesin receptors, such as those found in host membranes and extracellular matrix (ECM), or nonspecific physiochemical binding, enabling aggregation and biofilm ECM organization. This includes changes in microbial lipid composition, secretion of lipid quorum signals and lipase virulence factors, and shift to oxidative lipid metabolism to enable persistent colonization and high-density proliferation. Recent advances in ultra-high- performance liquid chromatography, high resolution mass spectrometry, and bioinformatics technologies have enabled detailed and accurate definition of the bacterial lipidome, aiding in identification of lipid pathways and targets for antimicrobial activity using a systems biology approach. Wound healing is further complicated by pro-inflammatory endogenous phospholipase activities. We propose that lipid ether amines (LEA) represent a platform for novel topical wound treatments with phospholipid anti- metabolite activity, counteracting both host and pathogen pathogenic mechanisms. As preliminary data, we demonstrate >3-log (>1000x) colony forming unit reductions in multiple in vitro cultured, antibiotic resistant biofilms and optimization of anti-metabolite activity. Phase I will synthesize additional candidates, screen for biofilm reduction and activity in host cells, selecting a platform lead to determine in vivo wound healing effects using biofilm infected db/db diabetic mouse model. LC-MS/MS analysis will be used to characterize bacterial or host lipidomes and treatment effect in each Aim. In Aim I, LEA candidate compounds will be screened for antimicrobial effect using clinically relevant, drug resistant ESKAPE (E. faecium, S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp.) pathogens in cultured biofilms, including a translatable wounded ex vivo pig skin explant model. In Aim II, LEA effects on migration and proliferation will be assessed using in vitro full thickness skin construct. In Aim III, the lead compound will be applied in a diabetic mouse wound healing model infected with PA or SA biofilms, to assess in vivo microbicidal and wound closure effects. In Phase II, we will escalate in vivo model complexity by inoculating with mixed bacterial biofilms, refine mechanism using in vitro binding and knock-down/out, evaluate potential adaptive resistance mechanisms, conduct comprehensive ADME-T study, and begin in vivo large mammal Proof of Concept for IND submission. NARRATIVE Chronic wounds are a ubiquitous healthcare problem, particularly as diabetic foot ulcers, often resulting in amputation. Treatment-resistant biofilm colonization inhibits resolution, combined approach of eliminating bacterial biofilm pathogens while correcting host wound dysfunction has the potential for enhancing resolution of chronic wounds.

"An expert-guided machine-learning approach to estimate the incidence, risk and harms associated with diagnostic delays for infectious diseases. Project Summary / Abstract Diagnostic errors are increasingly recognized as a cause of pain, suffering and increased healthcare costs. Diagnostic delays are an important class of diagnostic errors. While many diagnostic errors occur in hospital settings, emergency departments visits may be especially important to consider because they treat critically ill patients and because most decisions to admit patients to the hospital are made in emergency departments. Thus, to enable a more complete understanding of diagnostic delays requires consideration of healthcare visits across a range of healthcare settings including clinic visits, emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Delays in diagnosing infectious diseases are important to consider. For contagious infectious diseases, diagnostic delays increase the risk of additional exposures, potentially generating more cases. Second, many infectious diseases can be effectively treated, but even short delays in treatment lead to worse clinical outcomes. However, with the exception of a few infectious diseases (e.g., tuberculosis), diagnostic delays for infectious diseases are understudied. Thus, there is a critical need to investigate the incidence, risk factors and clinical impact for diagnostic delays for infectious diseases. The overarching goal of our research is to investigate diagnostic delays associated with infectious diseases using existing data along with methods from the fields of computer science and statistics. While our research relies upon “big data”, we will also use clinical experts to review and contribute to all of our results. Our subject matter experts incorporate expertise in infectious diseases, emergency medicine, acute care, medical education, diagnostic reasoning, healthcare epidemiology, public health, industry, and professional infectious disease societies. Specifically, we will 1) determine the incidence of diagnostic delays for a wide range of infectious diseases; 2) identify the risk factors associated with diagnostic delays for infectious diseases that are frequently delayed or have serious outcomes; and 3) estimate the impact of diagnostic delays in terms of healthcare costs and mortality. With our data, methods and clinical experts, we will be able to translate our results into future interventions designed to decrease diagnostic delays and improve healthcare outcomes. In addition, while our proposal focuses on infectious diseases, the methods and approaches that we will develop can be adopted to investigate non-infectious diseases and conditions. Project Narrative Diagnostic delays for infectious diseases contribute to worse clinical outcomes, increased healthcare costs and, for some infectious diseases, outbreaks of great public health importance. We will use existing large data sets along with machine-learning techniques and expert clinical guidance to detect patterns of healthcare visits representing diagnostic delays. Our goal is to characterize the incidence, risk factors and clinical impact of diagnostic delays for a wide range of infectious diseases to inform future interventions.","An expert-guided machine-learning approach to estimate the incidence, risk and harms associated with diagnostic delays for infectious diseases.",10251921,R01HS027375,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2021,490881,IA-02
"Preventing antimicrobial resistance and infections in hospitalized neonates in low resource settings Project Summary/Abstract Annually, 2.5 million babies die within the first four weeks of life, nearly a quarter due to infectious causes. Newborns admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) are especially vulnerable, due to such factors as prematurity, an immature immune system, and need for life-sustaining invasive procedures and devices. In low and middle income countries (LMIC), an increasing number of NICUs care for premature and critically ill newborns. Healthcare-associated bloodstream infections (HA-BSI) in LMIC are more common due to inadequate infection prevention and control (IPC) and more difficult to treat due to high rates of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Previous research in this setting focuses primarily on outbreak investigations and does not adequately describe risk factors for HA-BSI. Healthcare facilities lack effective tools to assess maternal and neonatal IPC and create improvement strategies. Preliminary data from the applicant's ongoing prospective cohort study that has enrolled over 6600 neonates in three NICUs in Pune, India, reinforces the high incidence of HA-BSI in this setting with a rate of 7.6 per 1000 patient-days, as well as high rates of AMR. Among Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, the most common BSI pathogen, 96% are resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and 38% to carbapenems. Among neonates with BSI, mortality is 22%. Within the framework of this study, the following are proposed: (1) To identify modifiable risk factors for HA-BSI in the NICU; (2) To develop a model for predicting infection with carbapenem-resistant organisms (CRO); and (3) To develop and pilot a novel tool to assess IPC practices in the NICU and Labor & Delivery. Identifying risk factors for HA-BSI in the NICU will promote development of targeted IPC strategies. Creation of a prediction model using a decision tree algorithm will help identify babies at highest risk of CRO infections. Such a model can support NICU clinicians in selecting the right antibiotics when infection is suspected, reducing time to appropriate therapy and decreasing unnecessary use of last resort antibiotics such as colistin. Development of an IPC assessment tool that incorporates human factors engineering (HFE) principles will enable healthcare facilities to optimize IPC and reduce risk of hospital-acquired infections and associated mortality. This mentored research will train the applicant in advanced epidemiologic methods and application of IPC in LMIC. The applicant is a neonatologist at Johns Hopkins University committed to patient-oriented research in resource-limited settings. Her long-term goals are to become a leader in neonatal IPC in low resource settings and devise interventions to reduce global burden of HA-BSI and associated mortality. This K23 will facilitate skill development in longitudinal data analysis, prediction models, survey development, HFE, and qualitative data analysis. Training will include formal coursework, supervised data analysis, and mentorship by a team with expertise in infectious diseases, IPC, biostatistics, epidemiology, patient safety, and HFE. Collectively, the activities of this K23 will provide a pathway to an independent career as a clinical investigator with expertise in healthcare epidemiology and IPC in low resource settings. Project Narrative Worldwide, more than 600,000 newborns die from infections each year. India has one of the highest burdens of newborn deaths due to bacterial infections, which are commonly resistant to antibiotics. In this study, I will identify risk factors for newborn bloodstream infections, develop a method for predicting antibiotic-resistant infections, and create an infection prevention survey to reduce risk of infections in hospitalized babies in Indian Neonatal Intensive Care Units.",Preventing antimicrobial resistance and infections in hospitalized neonates in low resource settings,10215584,K23HD100594,"['Klebsiella pneumoniae ', ' K pneumoniae ', ' K. pneumoniae ', ' Algorithms ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Bacterial Infections ', ' bacteria infection ', ' bacterial disease ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Carbapenems ', ' Cephalosporins ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Colistin ', ' Colimycin ', ' Colisticin ', ' Polymyxin E ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Decision Making ', ' Decision Trees ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Engineering ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gram-Negative Bacteria ', ' Hand ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' care facilities ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hygiene ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Incidence ', ' India ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Newborns ', ' newborn child ', ' newborn children ', ' Infection ', ' Neonatal Intensive Care Units ', ' Newborn Intensive Care Units ', ' neonatal ICU ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity -

"Mentoring in Immunometabolic Dysregulation in TB and TB/HIV Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death among people living with HIV (PLWH) worldwide. Despite recent scientific advances, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the immune mechanisms responsible for control and eradication of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. PLWH with latent TB infection (LTBI) have a ~10% annual risk of progressing to TB disease, however currently available tests for LTBI diagnosis have reduced sensitivity in this population and are not able to predict which latently infected individuals are at highest risk for developing TB for targeted preventive therapy. Emerging data from clinically relevant animal models suggest that LTBI and active TB represent a spectrum of immune responses and host pathology, with increasing metabolic changes and immune dysregulation during the transition to TB disease. We have identified unique serum metabolite and microRNA (miRNA) profiles that are able to discriminate between patients with TB and those with non-TB lung disease. However, these novel TB signatures have not been assessed prospectively to identify PLWH and HIV-negative persons with LTBI who are at increased risk for TB progression. In order to address this significant knowledge gap, in Aim 1 of the current research program, trainees will leverage the Indian and South African RePORT longitudinal biorepositories of household contacts of TB index cases to test the hypothesis that TB is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with profound changes in immune regulation and metabolism prior to the onset of clinical signs and symptoms. Another major barrier to global TB eradication efforts is the lengthy and complicated current anti-tubercular regimen, which is associated with medical nonadherence and the emergence of drug resistance. Recently, attention has focused on host-directed adjunctive therapies aimed at optimizing immune responses to the pathogen and improving lung damage. Lipid-laden macrophages (foam cells) are central to maintaining chronic TB infection by providing a favorable niche in which antimicrobial functions are down-regulated, and by inducing caseation and tissue damage. Recent work has shown that foam-cell-rich and necrotic areas of TB granulomas are particularly enriched in triglycerides. Mtb infection is associated with dysregulation of two cellular pathways involved in triglyceride homeostasis: a pro-lipogenic pathway involving protein kinase B and mTOR complex 1 (Akt/mTORC1), and an anti- lipogenic pathway involving AMP-activated protein kinase and the sirtuins (AMPK/SIRT). In Aim 2, trainees will use longitudinal clinical samples from RePORT study participants and experimental infections ex vivo to characterize: (i) the relationship between activation of these pathways and control of clinical Mtb infection, and the effect of anti-lipogenic treatments on antimycobacterial functions of human macrophages infected ex vivo. The research aims will be integrated with a mentoring strategy for mentees that fosters development of high impact patient-oriented research with a pathway to independence. Tuberculosis (TB) remains among the most deadly infections worldwide, especially among people living with HIV. Current available tests are not able to accurately detect persons at the highest risk of developing TB, and curing the disease requires at least 6 months of therapy because the TB bacteria can avoid being killed by the immune system and currently available drugs. In the current proposal, physician scientists will receive training in a variety of complementary disciplines, and use several cutting-edge experimental and modeling techniques to analyze samples from patients with TB and TB/HIV, with the ultimate goal of identifying new biomarkers that can predict TB disease and host-directed therapies that can shorten TB treatment.",Mentoring in Immunometabolic
