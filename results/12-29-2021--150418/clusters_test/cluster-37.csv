"Understanding and Predicting High-Need, High-Cost Patients among Older Adults PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This is a K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award submitted to the National Institute on Aging by Yongkang Zhang, a Research Associate in the Department of Healthcare Policy and Research at Weill Cornell Medical College (WCMC). Dr. Zhang’s career goal is to become an independent researcher on improving care for the elderly through developing and applying effective prediction tools to identify older adults with complex conditions and high healthcare needs. This K99/R00 application will provide Dr. Zhang with the necessary training 1) to understand the complexity and characteristics of high-need, high-cost (HNHC) older adults; 2) to develop a prediction model for HNHC adults using machine learning methods; and 3) to test the performance of the machine learning-based model with three commonly used, patient-risk prediction tools.  Dr. Zhang has assembled a mentor team of accomplished researchers across multiple divisions and departments at Weill Cornell Medical College: Dr. Rainu Kaushal (primary mentor) who is the Nanette Laitman Distinguished Professor and an expert on the HNHC patients and health data science; Dr. Lawrence Casalino (co-mentor) who is the Livingston Farrand Professor of Public Health and an expert on characteristics of and healthcare delivery for HNHC patients; Dr. Mark Lachs (co-mentor) who is a Professor of Geriatrics and prac- ticing geriatrician and an expert on the complexity and healthcare needs of older adults; Dr. Yuhua Bao (co- mentor) who is an Associate Professor of Healthcare Policy and Research and expert on behavioral health conditions and prescription data; Dr. Fei Wang (co-mentor) who is an Associate Professor of Health Informat- ics and an expert on machine learning methods; and Dr. James Flory (consultant) who is an Assistant Profes- sor of Healthcare Policy and Research and practicing clinician and an expert on medication use.  HNHC older adults are small group of patients representing a disproportionate share of healthcare utili- zation. These patients are more likely to experience preventable quality and safety problems due to their fre- quent interactions with health systems. Caring for HNHC older adults provides great potential benefits for qual- ity improvement and cost reduction. However, the benefits are unlikely to be realized unless these patients can be correctly identified and targeted. Building on his previous research and training on developing a claims data-based taxonomy for HNHC Medicare patients, Dr. Zhang’s research will understand the characteristics of HNHC older adults and develop predictors for these patients using clinical and prescription data (Aim 1), de- velop a machine learning-based prediction model for HNHC older adults (Aim 2), and compare the perfor- mance of the prediction model with three commonly used, patient risk prediction tools (Aim 3). This research will be the foundation for an R01 grant application that will incorporate this prediction model into healthcare de- livery process and identify the optimal ways to inform opportunities for improvement in healthcare delivery. PROJECT NARRATIVE High-need, high-cost (HNHC) older adults are a small group of individuals representing a disproportionate share of healthcare utilization and experiencing preventable quality and safety problems. Improving care for HNHC older adults is challenging because of their complex medical, behavioral, and social conditions and the instability of their healthcare utilization. Developing a prediction model for HNHC older adults could better inform patient-centered clinical decision-making, help target quality improvement interventions, and prioritize the allocation of scarce healthcare resources.","Understanding and Predicting High-Need, High-Cost Patients among Older Adults",10150732,K99AG064030,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Award ', ' Calibration ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health delivery systems ', ' health services delivery ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Foundations ', ' Geriatrics ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Goals ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Safety ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Social Conditions ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Taxonomy ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' frailty ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' experience ', ' health care organization ', ' healthcare organization ', ' healthcare service organization ', ' health care service organization ', ' Performance ', ' professor ', ' Risk Adjustment ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral health ', ' performance tests ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Health Informatics ', ' consumer informatics ', ' Public Health Informatics ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Policy Research ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Research Training ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' National Institute of Aging ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' post-doctoral training ', ' postdoctoral training ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' effective intervention ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' multimorbidity ', ' clinical risk ', ' Patient risk ', ' health data ', ' mid-career faculty ', ' associate faculty ', ' associate professor ', ' midcareer faculty ', ' distinguished professor ', ' Data Science ', ' care coordination ', ' coordinating care ', ' random forest ', ' multilayer perceptron ', ' social vulnerability ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,K99,2021,125185,NY-12
"Comparative Risks and Benefits of Pharmacological Therapies for Older Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The prevalence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in older adults (≥65y) is rising, and there is limited evidence-based guidance on treating these older adults. In older patients with multi-morbidity, treatment decisions should factor in not only risk of disease complications, but also treatment complications and non-IBD, extra-intestinal complications. Hence, to inform optimal treatment approach, a comprehensive assessment of comparative effects of different therapies on all of these outcomes is warranted. Existing single-center observational studies are limited by small sample size, and missing data due to fragmented health care, whereas administrative claims-based studies are limited by lack of detailed clinical data; these limitations can be overcome by linking the two data sources. In this patient-oriented mentored career development award proposal, Dr. Siddharth Singh proposes to: (Aim #1.1) characterize disease burden and treatment patterns, (Aim #1.2) assess and predict risks of death, disease, treatment and extra-intestinal complications using machine-learning algorithms and (Aim #2.1) compare overall effectiveness and (Aim #2.2) safety of different treatment strategies in older patients with IBD. This will be studied using a highly innovative informatics-based approach in a multi-site, electronic medical record (EMR)-based cohort of older patients with IBD, linked to their corresponding Medicare claims. The EMR-based cohort will facilitate phenotyping and disease severity assessment, and linkage to Medicare claims will augment exposure and outcome ascertainment, overcoming challenges of fragmentation of healthcare and short follow-up. The central hypothesis is that, that older adults have systematically different risk profiles than younger adults, and using biologic monotherapy is a safer and more effective approach to treating IBD, as compared to using long-term corticosteroids alone, non-biologic immunomodulator monotherapy, and combination therapy of biologics and immunomodulators. The access to the advanced infrastructure of pSCANNER (Patient-centered Scalable National Network for Effectiveness Research), one of 13 PCORI-funded Clinical Data Research Networks, and entire Medicare database, in a highly supportive and conducive environment at UCSD, with cross-disciplinary mentorship by a collaborative and experienced team of mentors and advisors from diverse backgrounds (clinical informatics, comparative effectiveness research, IBD therapeutics) is a key strength of this application. Besides directly informing clinical practice on treatment approaches in older patients with IBD, this proposal will enhance the career of the candidate by providing unique skills in applied clinical informatics, privacy-preserving record linkage techniques, predictive analytics, and comparative effectiveness research, and create a multi-institutional, EMR- based cohort of well-characterized IBD patients, linked with Medicare claims. This will ultimately contribute to the candidate's long-term goal of establishing an independent IBD research career focusing on comparative effectiveness research and population health management using novel informatics-based approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE The information on comparative effectiveness and safety of different therapies in the context of patients' risk profile generated using this novel informatics-based approach in a unique linked EMR-Medicare database, will directly inform treatment of older patients with IBD, and enhance comparative effectiveness research methods.",Comparative Risks and Benefits of

"Understanding and Improving Inequities in Palliative Care for Older Adults with Advanced Dementia and Limited-English Proficiency: A Mixed-Methods Evaluation PROJECT SUMMARY Older adults with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias and limited-English proficiency (LEP) are at high risk of receiving suboptimal, goal-discordant care because of language and cultural barriers to effective communication about goals of care. Palliative care provides a way to improve quality of life and facilitate goal- concordant care by supporting effective person-family-clinician communication, but is under-utilized by older adults with Dementia and LEP and their families. No studies have sought to identify targets for intervention to address barriers to palliative care at multiple levels (i.e., patient/family, clinician, system, and community- levels) for this vulnerable population. Addressing this gap will be essential for the development of effective interventions to improve the quality of care for older adults with Dementia and LEP. The long-term goal of this work is to develop, evaluate, and disseminate interventions to facilitate culturally-sensitive palliative care for older adults with Dementia and LEP and their families. The rationale for this study is that before effective culturally- and linguistically-appropriate interventions to improve palliative care for older adults with Dementia and LEP can be developed, quantitative and qualitative data is needed to evaluate the scope of existing inequities and identify modifiable multi-level barriers to the delivery of high-quality palliative care for this population. Aim 1 utilizes quantitative methods to compare the quality of care received by decedents with advanced Dementia and LEP to those with English proficiency in four key palliative care domains (utilization of care, documentation of patient goals and preferences, symptom assessment, and circumstances of death) using EHR-based quality metrics and novel machine learning methods. Aim 2 utilizes qualitative interviews with key stakeholders (older adults with Dementia and LEP and their family members, caseworker-cultural mediators and interpreters, and clinicians and administrators) to identify modifiable targets for intervention across multiple levels. Aim 3 utilizes qualitative interviews with leaders of community-based organizations to assess community-level resources and capacity to support high quality palliative care for older adults with Dementia and LEP. Our interdisciplinary team is experienced in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia research, community engagement with LEP populations, and quantitative and qualitative methods. The proposal is innovative because it evaluates multi-level barriers to palliative care across three diverse LEP populations (Latinx, Chinese, and Vietnamese), and uses machine learning methods to evaluate the quality of care across several palliative care domains in a large health system. The proposed research is significant because these data will enable the identification and prioritization of multi-level targets for the development of culturally and linguistically-appropriate interventions to improve palliative care for older adults with Dementia and LEP. Ultimately, this work will advance a model of care that facilitates goal-concordant, high-quality care for older adults with Dementia and LEP and supports the palliative care needs of their family members. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it represents an innovative multi-level approach to identifying targets for effective interventions to improve the quality of care for older adults with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias and limited-English proficiency through improved palliative care. These results will enable the identification and prioritization of modifiable factors to inform effective and scalable strategies to facilitate goal-concordant care for this vulnerable population. The proposed research addresses the NIA's mission to eliminate disparities and improve the well-being of older adults with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias and their family caregivers.",Understanding and Improving Inequities in Palliative Care for Older Adults with Advanced Dementia and Limited-English Proficiency: A Mixed-Methods Evaluation,10300274,R01AG074253,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Persons ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Palliative Care ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' comfort care ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Administrator ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family member ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' Chinese People ', ' Chinese ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Evaluation ', ' Knowledge ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' end of life care ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' end-of-life ', ' end of life ', ' Symptoms ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' symptom management ', ' manage symptom ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' advanced dementia ', ' therapy development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' Limited English Proficiency ', ' Infrastructure ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' sociodemographic factors ', ' socio-demographic factors ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' Latinx ', ' Prognosis ', ' disparity elimination ', ' eliminate disparities ', ' eliminating disparities ', ' community engagement ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,693147,WA-07
"Perioperative Cognitive Anesthesia Network Extension for Socially Vulnerable Older Adults ABSTRACT The U.S. healthcare system cares for increasing numbers of older adults, including those with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, who require surgery with anesthesia. Regional social inequities, as measured by spatial indices such as area deprivation and social vulnerability indices, independently contribute to differences in perioperative and neurodegenerative outcomes. Data also support a significant association between neighborhood-level area deprivation indices with Alzheimer’s disease neuropathology. Despite emerging evidence linking social determinants of health with disparities in postoperative outcomes in older adults, investigations in these areas increasingly require expertise with disparate subject matters, including clinical perioperative practice, geriatrics, neuropsychology, social determinants of health, geospatial analyses, and even artificial intelligence. The K07 applicant is a National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded independent investigator and fellowship-trained anesthesiologist with expertise in regional anesthesia and orthopedic surgery, as well as research experience in machine learning, geospatial disparities, and perioperative pain and cognition. The purpose of this proposal is to promote institutional and community awareness of how social vulnerabilities impact perioperative outcomes in older adults, including those with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, and particularly those outcomes related to postoperative pain and cognition. The overall strategy of this proposal is to develop interdisciplinary research infrastructure along with transdisciplinary training programs to crosspollinate research teams. This structure will be organized via the Perioperative Cognitive Anesthesia Network-Social Vulnerability (PeCANSV) construct in three aims: Aim 1: Convene a PeCANSV multidisciplinary advisory team to establish three supplemental cores in 1) geospatial infrastructure; 2) social determinants of health; 3) artificial intelligence. Aim 2: Accelerate research discovery through interdisciplinary research pathways by formalizing nascent linkages between supplemental PeCANSV cores and UF resources and extant geospatial, environmental, cognitive, and clinical perioperative databases at UF Health and throughout Florida. Aim 3: Develop a transdisciplinary workforce of clinical and basic science researchers to lead interdisciplinary teams addressing the social vulnerability of older adult surgical patients. Milestones include regular analysis of strengths, opportunities, aspirations, and results, interdisciplinary proposal submissions, and evidence of trainee success in perioperative research in social disparities of older adults, including those with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias.  NARRATIVE The U.S. healthcare system cares for increasing numbers of older adults, including those with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, who require surgery with anesthesia. Regional social inequities, measured by spatial indices such as area deprivation and social vulnerability indices, independently contribute to differences in perioperative and neurodegenerative outcomes. Via the K07 mechanism and associated institutional support, the applicant will develop transdisciplinary research training and infrastructure involving geospatial data, social determinants of health, and artificial intelligence to address these challenges. This proposal will ultimately reduce disparities in postoperative outcomes in older adult surgical patients, including those with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, with a particular emphasis on outcomes pertaining to postoperative pain and cognitive decline.",Perioperative Cognitive Anesthesia Network Extension for Socially Vulnerable Older Adults,10281822,K07AG073468,"['United States

"Individualized Vestibular Rehabilitation for Elderly with Self-Management and Gaming Elements Project Summary/Abstract: Vestibular rehabilitation has been proven to be effective in reducing dizziness and falls in older adults, but patient adherence is a major problem. Recent research shows that less than half of patients complete their rehabilitation. Some of the main reasons for this are the numerous visits that are required and accessibility. In particular for older individuals who experience dizziness and/or falls, it may be difficult to travel to attend rehabilitation sessions. Additionally, rehabilitation programs become expensive in terms of equipment and health professional’s time. Programs may also not be available to all who may benefit because of geographical limitations. Previous research has shown that remote monitoring and gaming elements have great potential to solve these issues, even in an older population. However, current solutions are generic and effectiveness can be inconsistent. The overall goal of this project is to develop a vestibular rehabilitation app to be used by older adults at home. The app will improve adherence through gaming, self-management, and remote monitoring. Patients will use low-cost sensors placed on their bodies (head and waist) to play the games on the app. This allows simultaneous monitoring of patient progress while performing the exercises. This data can be shared with a clinician via email or the cloud, allowing the patient to perform the rehabilitation at their home and the clinician to monitor how well the patients performed their exercises. The vestibular rehabilitation components are packaged in a phone and tablet app that is easy to navigate for older individuals and has a modular design that allows individualized rehabilitation. By improving patient engagement and enjoyment, rehabilitation adherence should be improved as well. Phase I demonstrated feasibility of this approach. In Phase II, games will be added to cover a full at-home rehabilitation session and improve usability of the app. In addition, machine learning algorithms will be developed to provide real-time feedback if exercises are performed incorrectly. This ensures patients will perform their exercises correctly when at home. As in Phase I, clinical collaborators will provide continued guidance and testing throughout development to ensure clinical relevance and promote adoption during commercialization. This project uses a novel approach in that it develops rehabilitation games specifically designed for vestibular rehabilitation through a mobile app tailored for an older population. Current gaming approaches for rehabilitation typically use existing or commercial games. The use of sensors for remote monitoring is also novel in this area and allows patients to perform rehabilitation at their home, while being monitored by a clinician. This project is therefore likely to have a high clinical impact. It will advance clinical practice, make vestibular rehabilitation more accessible to older individuals, and help adherence to programs. Successful implementation of this program will reduce falls and improve quality of life of for patients. Project Narrative: The overall goal of this project is to develop an app for older individuals that will improve accessibility of vestibular rehabilitation and that will improve compliance compared to current rehabilitation programs.

"Uncovering and Surveilling Financial Deception Risk in Aging Project Summary. Among older adults, sudden and unexpected financial losses as a result of fraud can have devastating consequences. A rapidly aging population, combined with age-related changes in decision-making processes, means that fraudulent activities targeting older adults is a growing public health problem that requires surveillance, education, and intervention. Motivated by theories of cognitive, socioemotional, and neurobiological aging, this proposal investigates behavioral and neural decision-making mechanisms associated with fraud risk in older adulthood. In a more globally connected and computerized world, older adults may constitute particular at-risk targets for highly effective forms of online financial fraud, such as through social engineering in the form of emails containing malicious links or attachments (phishing). Susceptibility to financial deception in aging has been investigated primarily in the context of age-related cognitive decline, while socioemotional and neurophysiological parameters have been largely understudied. Further, there are few effective approaches to characterize, monitor and detect, and eventually prevent, financial deception. The objectives of the proposed research are threefold: Aim 1 will determine financial deception risk across the adult life span. This aim will seek to confirm that age is associated with greater susceptibility to financial deception, online and in person. Aim 2 will characterize cognitive, socioemotional, and neurophysiological mechanisms associated with deception risk. Specifically, this aim will uncover the extent to which cognitive and socioemotional dysfunction, age-related dampening in neurophysiological reactivity, and structural and functional brain changes contribute to increased susceptibility in aging. Aim 3 involves the development and psychometric validation of a novel risk assessment interview and the development of an automated deception warning tool to alert older adults about potential online fraud. Our research design will span three data collection phases comprising healthy young, middle-aged, young-old, and old-old individuals. Leveraging infrastructure developed in our lab, a behavioral field experiment will determine real-life susceptibility to financial fraud via simulated phishing email attacks (Phase I). A comprehensive in-lab assessment of cognitive/socioemotional and neurophysiological mechanisms will follow (Phase II and III, respectively). A data-analytic Phase IV will integrate data collected across Phases I-III using statistical and machine-learning methods. This multidisciplinary approach, encompassing psychology, neuroscience, computer science, and engineering will lay the foundation for building an integrated approach to risk detection and the provision of financial decision-making supports in older adulthood. Findings and methodologies developed as part of this project have the potential to inform real-life decision-supportive interventions that adopt an age-targeted approach towards the long-term goal of financial risk reduction in older individuals. Project Narrative A rapidly aging population means that financial deception of the aged is an emerging public health problem that requires surveillance and intervention. An increasingly common form of financial fraud is conducted online as older adults more and more manage their assets online. The project goal is to determine cognitive, socioemotional, and neurobiological risk factors for financial deception in older adults and validate risk assessment and develop detection tools toward a long-term goal of identifying individuals who are particularly susceptible to financial fraud and facilitating prevention and decision-supportive intervention efforts.",Uncovering and Surveilling Financial Deception Risk in Aging,10440656,R01AG057764,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Arousal ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Censuses ', ' Computers ', ' Cues ', ' Data Collection ', ' Decision Making ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' E-Mail ', ' Email ', ' electronic communication ', ' Engineering ', ' Epidemic ', ' Foundations ', ' Fraud ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Interview ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Deception ', ' Methodology ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' Persons ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Psychology ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' Competence ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Anterior ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Link ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Individual ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Age-associated cognitive decline ', ' Age-related cognitive decline ', ' Benign senescent forgetfulness ', ' age associated memory decline ', ' age related cognitive deficit ', ' age related cognitive impairment ', ' age related memory dysfunction ', ' Age-associated memory impairment ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' American ', ' computer science ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Transact ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' cost ', ' financial decision making ', ' digital ', ' computerized ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' phishing ', ' Affective ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' brain behavior ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' aging population ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' cyber security ', ' cybersecurity ', ' internet security ', ' decision-making capacity ', ' Data Analytics ', ' personalized approach ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' precision approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', ' social factors ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2021,78373,FL-03
"BE IMMUNE: Behavioral Economics to Improve and Motivate vaccination Using Nudges through the EHR PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Vaccine-preventable diseases such as influenza, pneumococcal disease, and shingles lead to significant rates of illness, hospitalization, and death among older adults. In the United States, vaccination rates have been mostly unchanged for a decade with lower rates among racial and ethnic minority groups. New and scalable approaches are needed to address this important public health issue. Nudges are changes to the way choices are offered or information is framed that can have outsized effects on behavior. For example, default options are the path of least resistance and the action that takes place if no alternatives are selected. Active choice is a method that prompts a decision-making now, rather than waiting for stakeholders to recognize the need to make the decision on their own. Our groups at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn Medicine) and the University of Washington (UW Medicine) have formed behavioral design teams embedded within the operations of our health systems and have demonstrated how these types of nudges can improve health care value and patient outcomes. Since electronic health records (EHRs) have been adopted by more than 90% of clinicians in the US, this scalable technology platform is an optimal environment to implement and deploy these types of nudges. In this study, we propose to design, test, and implemented personalized nudges to clinicians and patients to target barriers among high-risk subgroups to improve vaccination rates. We will pilot this at two health systems and then implement a pragmatic trial at those health systems and sites in the VA Health System. In the R61 phase, we will focus on the following aims at Penn Medicine and UW Medicine. Aim 1: To use EHR data and analytical methods to identify high-risk groups of older adults with suboptimal vaccination rates for influenza, pneumococcal disease, and herpes zoster. Aim 2: To assess the feasibility of implementing different types of personalized nudges to clinicians and patients to target the identified groups to improve vaccination rates among older adults. Aim 3: To pilot test ways to personalize promising nudges to clinicians and patients for improving vaccination among older adults. In the R33 phase, we will focus on the following aims at Penn Medicine, UW Medicine, and the VA Health System. Aim 1: To conduct a 12-month, multisite, cluster randomized, pragmatic trial to evaluate the effectiveness of personalized nudges to clinicians and patients relative to control to improve vaccination rates among older adults. Aim 2: To evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention on reducing disparities in vaccination rates related to race/ethnicity and socioeconomic factors. Aim 3: To evaluate heterogeneity in treatment effect across clinician, patient, and practice characteristics to further tailor approaches in future intervention design. PROJECT NARRATIVE Many older adults are at risk of illness, hospitalization, and death from vaccine-preventable diseases. Moreover, there are significant racial and ethnic disparities in care with even lower vaccination rates among African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians. In this study, we will use analytical methods to identify high-risk subgroups, test personalized nudges to address barriers among these groups, and then implement a pragmatic, multisite trial to evaluate the effectiveness of personalized nudges to clinicians and patients to improve vaccination rates among older adults and reduce disparities in care.",BE IMMUNE: Behavioral Economics to Improve and Motivate vaccination Using Nudges through the EHR,10238860,R61AG068945,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Behavior ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Herpes zoster disease ', ' Herpes Zoster ', ' Shingles ', ' Zona ', ' Zoster ', ' herpes zona ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Influenza ', ' Grippe ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Minority People ', ' Minority Population ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Pneumococcal Infections ', ' Streptococcus pneumoniae Infections ', ' pneumococcal disease ', ' pneumococcus infection ', ' Preventive Health Services ', ' Preventative health service ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Risk ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' socio-economic factors ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' United States Department of Veterans Affairs ', ' United States Veterans Administration ', ' Veterans Administration ', ' Veterans Affairs ', ' Universities ', ' Vaccination ', ' Influenza vaccination ', ' Flu vaccination ', ' Influenza immunization ', ' Prophylactic vaccination against influenza ', ' flu immunisation ', ' influenza virus vaccination ', ' vaccination against influenza ', ' Vaccines ', ' Vendor ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Asians ', ' Workload ', ' Work Load ', ' African American ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Pattern ', ' Visit ', ' Medical center ', ' peer ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Health Informatics ', ' consumer informatics ', ' Public Health Informatics ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Characteristics ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Behavioral ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' treatment effect ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' multi-site trial ', ' multisite trial ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' pragmatic effectiveness trial ', ' prescription opioid ', ' licit opioid ', ' opiate medication ', ' opioid medication ', ' prescribed opiate ', ' prescribed opioid ', ' prescription opiate ', ' operation ', ' Cluster randomized trial ', ' Cluster randomization trial ', ' behavioral economics ', ' Data Analytics ', ' personalized approach ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' precision approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative care ', ' racial minority ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' disparate health care ', ' disparate healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' health service use ', ' health service utilization ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' Veterans Health Administration ', ' Veterans Health Affairs ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R61,2021,288540,PA-03
"Voice2Connect: Informing the Design of Smart Speakers for Social Connectedness in Low-Income Older Adults Project Summary/Abstract There is a growing public health concern regarding the high risk of social isolation and loneliness among low- income older adults and its resulting impact on their longevity and overall well-being. The issue of social isolation is particularly relevant to low-income senior housing (LISH) residents who often have multiple chronic conditions and disabilities, lack of financial and social resources, and limited social networks. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop innovative approaches to mitigate these issues in older adults living in LISH. Voice- operated smart speakers have the potential to reduce social isolation and loneliness in this population, for example, by connecting with other people, sending a reminder about social activities, or providing a conversational agent. The hands-free voice control provides improved accessibility and usability for people with low literacy, vision impairment, mobility limitation, or poor dexterity issues. We propose to examine how smart speakers can support the needs of social connectedness among older adults living alone in LISH. We will use an iterative user-centered design and employ a mixed-methods approach, incorporating participatory methods, focus group interviews, and functional and psychosocial health questionnaires. The specific aims of this study are: (1) to determine experiences of social isolation, user needs, user context, and preferences related to the use of smart speakers for social connectedness in the LISH setting, (2) to evaluate older adults (smart speaker users and non-users)’ and stakeholders’ attitudes towards the in-home use of smart speakers for promoting social engagement, with a focus on perceived usability and usefulness of the technology, and (3) to identify potential implementation barriers and privacy concerns among older adults and stakeholders. Stakeholders will include housing staff members (N=10) and health care professionals (N=6) providing wellness services to LISH residents. Older adults (N=36) will form six focus groups and take part in a series of three focus group sessions in which they participate in user-centered design activities to identify potential smart speaker features that can support the needs of social connectedness. Their thoughts and ideas will be used to develop low-fidelity prototypes and scenarios of use for each prototype. After prototype and scenario development, we will seek input from the older adults, housing staff, and health care providers through focus groups, which will be used to refine the prototype. The refined prototypes will be validated with the older adult participants. We will use a thematic analysis and inductive coding method to analyze focus group interview transcripts. Descriptive statistics will be used to analyze the questionnaire data collected from older adults and stakeholders. Findings from this study will inform our future research where we build smart speaker algorithms and functionalities that can facilitate the planning of innovative smart speaker-based social connectedness interventions for older adults in LISH. Project Narrative The proposed study aims to examine how smart speaker technologies can support the needs for social connectedness among older adults living alone in low-income senior housing communities. This study is highly relevant to public health as it represents an early exploration of what potential features and functionalities of smart speakers can address the issue of social isolation and loneliness in low-income senior housing residents. Findings from this study will facilitate the planning of low-cost, innovative technology-based interventions for reducing social isolation and improving social connections for our most vulnerable aging U.S. population.",Voice2Connect: Informing the Design of Smart Speakers for Social Connectedness in Low-Income Older Adults,10264140,R03AG069816,"['Adoption ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Attitude ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Group Interviews ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Housing ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Independent Living ', ' Leisure Activities ', ' literacy ', ' Loneliness ', ' lonely ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Names ', ' Perception ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Social isolation ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Staff Attitudes ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Transportation ', ' Universities ', ' Virginia ', ' Visual impairment ', ' Diminished Vision ', ' Low Vision ', ' Partial Sight ', ' Reduced Vision ', ' Subnormal Vision ', ' vision impairment ', ' visually impaired ', ' Voice ', ' Wellness Program ', ' Work ', ' Privacy ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' cognitive function ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' psychosocial ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' innovative technologies ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' social ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' social capital ', ' Data ', ' Transcript ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Health Professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' community living ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' user centered design ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' Systems Development ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' multimorbidity ', ' dexterity ', ' social engagement ', ' social involvement ', ' social participation ', ' intelligent personal assistant ', ' digital assistant ', ' intelligent assistant ', ' personal digital assistant ', ' virtual assistant ', ' implementation barriers ', ' implementation challenges ', ' Home ', ' community engagement ', ' ']",NIA,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R03,2021,77625,VA-04
"PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing ABSTRACT Preoperative cognitive impairment is common among older adults preparing for surgery. Despite growing evidence that preoperative cognitive/neuronal integrity is a risk factor for perioperative insults and post- operative adverse outcomes, health care systems do not systematically pre-operatively screen for cognition. Clinical researchers have yet to identify a pragmatic approach to pre-operative cognitive screening. Our team members have developed the digital Clock Drawing Test (dCDT), a tool that captures subtle behavioral variables during a rapid (5-minute) clock drawing assessment. The data and benefit afforded by this tool have yet to be considered across perioperative contexts. We will apply the dCDT within a large number of pre- surgical patients (n=5,000 per year) coupled with novel machine learning algorithms to address three specific aims. Aim 1: examine range and distribution of preoperative neurocognitive impairment with older adult preoperative patients relative to non-surgical older adult demographically matched peers (available n=2,400 via NIH/Boston University Framingham Heart Study) using novel previously unobserved dCDT graphomotor and decision making variables; Aim 2: examine the predictive validity of presurgical dCDT variables on postoperative, clinician reported/hospital recorded events; Aim 3: examine pre to postoperative 6-week, 3- month, and 1-year change in dCDT and NIH PROMIS metrics for thoracic (n=70), orthopedic (n=70), major abdominal-pelvic patients (n=70), and non-surgery peers (n=70). For the observational studies (Aim 1 and 2), individuals > 65 years presenting to the UFHealth presurgical clinic will complete the dCDT as well as a three- word memory test and frailty assessment as part of the standard clinical evaluation. Surgical and anesthetic details will be acquired via the electronic medical record. Clinically-relevant outcomes will include complications, length of stay, cost of care, functional capacity, and mortality. Outcomes will be supplemented by a separate longitudinally-studied subgroup (Aim 3) completing NIH PROMIS metrics at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 1year after surgery. Analyses will focus on stratifying distributions and clusters of dCDT characteristics across numerous sociodemographic, surgical, and anesthetic factors. The predictive value of the dCDT will be modeled relative to clinical outcomes. Changes in dCDT and baseline NIH PROMIS domains will be compared pre- and post-operatively and examined for interactions with longitudinal perioperative events. Subaims: We will apply `deep learning' approaches to drawings to identify novel features of pre-surgical patients relative to a large sample of demographically equated dCDT data points available through the Framingham Heart Study. Symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX)-based machine learning approaches will characterize interactions between preoperative dCDT features and intraoperative anesthetic sensitivities.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Assessing cognition prior to surgery has relevance for a number of reasons, but has yet to be applied due to pragmatic issues associated with assessment complexities and time. Here, we will leverage a modernized digital version of a well-known cognitive screening tool (the Clock Drawing Test) to examine 1) pre-operative cognitive abilities in adults > 65 years attending a tertiary academic medical hospital pre-operative clinic; 2) how pre-operative cognitive abilities predict post-operative hospital/clinical reported outcomes (i.e., length of stay, hospital cost) and 3) how pre-operative cognitive abilities interact with perioperative events to predict post-operative cognitive change and patient reported outcomes. The study will result in improved ability to appreciate cognition in older adults electing surgery and optimize their perioperative experience.",PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital

"Development and Validation of a Prediction Model for Longitudinal Fall Risk in Older Adults ABSTRACT My goal is to establish myself as an independent biostatistical researcher who develops and validates prediction models that are critical to identifying older adults at high risk of adverse health outcomes using novel machine learning methodology. My passion for developing prediction models for health outcomes in older adults stems from my desire to help people, especially older adults who are vulnerable. I developed a machine learning method called Binary Mixed Model (BiMM) forest, which is particularly suited for developing prediction models for repeated measures of outcomes in older adults because it accommodates dynamic fluctuations over time which are common in aging (e.g., functional status). Environment: Wake Forest School of Medicine is a nationally-recognized leader in geriatric research and provides an outstanding environment for accomplishing my goals. Mentors: I have an excellent interdisciplinary mentoring team consisting of experts in aging, biostatistics and informatics who are dedicated to supporting me in completing the research and training aims proposed in this K25 grant. Training: I will complete activities aimed to address gaps in my training with the guidance of my mentoring team. My Training Objectives are to 1) acquire knowledge about gerontology and geriatrics, 2) deepen my understanding of missing data mechanisms and techniques, 3) learn about the appropriate use of electronic health record (EHR) data for research purposes, and 4) develop leadership, networking, communication and grant writing skills. To accomplish these objectives, I will attend conferences, seminars, journal club, case conferences and writing workshops, observe a geriatric clinician, and complete coursework. The K25 grant will allow me to extend previous training, which will provide me superior knowledge, experience and skills for my future as a biostatistical researcher in aging. Research: Early identification of older adults at-risk of falling is critical so that preventative care plans may be implemented to improve patient outcomes and reduce burden on the health care system. Most current prediction models cannot handle repeated measurements over time and have not been used with EHR data. I propose to use my BiMM forest method to develop a prediction model for fall risk over time. My Research Specific Aims are to 1) impute (fill in) missing predictor data in Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study with a novel machine learning method (BiMM forest); 2) develop a prediction model for identifying older adults at-risk for falls; and 3) assess the feasibility of using EHR data to externally validate the prediction model. The prediction model developed in this proposal will aid in identification of at-risk individuals for falls, allowing providers to intervene early to reduce the burden of falls for patients, caregivers and healthcare systems. Results from this grant will provide a basis for future R01 submissions to further validate the prediction model using EHR data from multiple health care centers and evaluate the clinical utility of the model in practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Identifying older adults at-risk for falls is critical for implementing preventative interventions aimed at reducing adverse outcomes, but developing prediction models for fall-risk remains challenging due to analytic shortcomings, missing data, and limitations of electronic health record (EHR) data.

"Stanford Aging & Ethnogeriatrics Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center (SAGE) ABSTRACT Falls are the leading cause of fatal and non-fatal injuries in older adults (ages 65+). Injuries due to falling result in 2.8 million emergency visits annually, and 25% of falls result in very serious injuries (such as fractures or traumatic brain injury). Through this diversity supplement, Dr. Monroe Kennedy, an engineer interested in aging research, seeks to get training and mentoring in geroscience. As part of this diversity supplement, Dr. Kennedy, proposes to develop a wearable smartbelt device that can alert the wearer to risk of falling and potentially prevent falls. Combined with a robust training plan, the proposed activities will prepare Dr. Kennedy to become a leader in geriatrics research and make impactful contributions to the field of aging research.  Aim 1 will be to conduct focus groups with older adults on the wearable smartbelt device, such as style and comfort. Aim 2 will test the wearable smartbelt device by collecting visual and sensor data from older adults while walking on various surfaces at slow and brisk paces. The data will be used to train the falls prevention model utilizing machine learning methods. The ultimate goal is for the model to be able to calculate fall risk by predicting potential walking trajectories of the wearer and imbalance and alert the wearer via vibrotactile response if the risk of falling is probable. By preventing falls from occurring in the first place, the proposed device has the potential to greatly increase the overall well-being, long-term health, and independence of older adults as well as costs associated with hospital visits and caregiving. PROJECT NARRATIVE Falls are the leading cause of fatal and non-fatal injuries for older adults. The goal of this project is to develop a wearable smartbelt device that can predict whether the wearer is at risk of falling so that the wearer can stop and ensure they are balanced before continuing to walk.

"Innovative technologies for active surveillance of older adults with low-risk skin cancer PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the number one cancer diagnosed in the US each year and accounts for more cases than all other cancers combined.1,2 Most BCCs are not dangerous, as they typically grow slowly and rarely metastasize or affect quality of life. Because cumulative exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun is a major cause of these lesions, BCCs are considered a non-lethal disease of aging, with the vast majority occurring in people 65 years or older. Despite the low risk BCCs present to patients, in the US all lesions are usually treated. Though existing treatments are effective,3,4 post treatment complications are common; in one prospective cohort study 27% of patients reported a problem after a procedure.5 Moreover, over 100,000 BCCs are treated annually in persons who ultimately die within one year of unrelated causes.6 For patients near the end of life, who often manage multiple health issues, treating these lesions may expose them to the associated medical risks with little potential benefit.7  There is a pressing need to reduce over-treatment and instead develop safe and effective active surveillance methods for low risk BCC in older patients. This research aims to fundamentally change the current “one size fits all” standard of care for treatment of BCCs, which is particularly problematic for older adults.6,8,9 The goal of this application is to develop a mobile app for safe, home-based active surveillance of low risk basal cell carcinomas (BCCs). We hypothesize that home-based active surveillance of low risk BCCs would reduce unnecessary procedures, complications and burdensome clinic visits in patients whose BCCs are not changing, while ensuring that patients whose BCCs grow or become symptomatic receive prompt care. For the first step of the proposed research, we will refine an existing artificial intelligence algorithm and mobile app to optimize it for at-home active surveillence use for older adults with low-risk BCC. We will then conduct pre-testing with a small group of patients and caregivers (n=15) to iteratively improve the app and ensure usability. Finally, we will compare the data collected via the app to that collected during routine clinical visits. Over a 9-month period, we will follow participants (n=30) with low-risk BCC who have selected an active surveillance option. We will collect data monthly through the app, and every 3 months through in-person clinic visits. We will evaluate patient satisfaction and clinical course to determine the feasibility of using a mobile app for active surveillance of low-risk BCC.

"Using the Electronic Health Record to Identify and Promote Goals-of-Care Communication for Older Patients with Serious Illness Although discussions that address patients' goals of care are one of the most important aspects of palliative care, this communication is often lacking in our healthcare system. Goals-of-care communication is associated with improved patient and family outcomes and reduced intensity of care at the end of life. Electronic health records (EHR) provide a key opportunity to identify patients who would benefit from these discussions and to promote these discussions, yet prior interventions have not used the EHR for this purpose.  Older adults with chronic illness, and particularly those with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), are especially vulnerable to inappropriately intensive end-of-life care. To address this shortcoming, we build on two of our most successful programs, one using the EHR to identify goals-of-care discussions and the other a novel intervention called Jumpstart that promotes and enhances these discussions. We will examine the effectiveness of the Jumpstart intervention for hospitalized older adults with chronic illness and specifically oversample those with ADRD to understand the effectiveness of the intervention in this key group.  We propose 2 linked, complementary randomized trials. Trial 1, a pragmatic trial, compares usual care with a clinician-facing Jumpstart for hospitalized older adults with serious illness (n=2000). Trial 2, a comparative effectiveness trial, compares this clinician-facing Jumpstart with a bi-directional, patient-specific Jumpstart based on surveys completed by patients or family members (n=400). We hypothesize that the clinician-facing Jumpstart will improve outcomes compared to usual care, and the bi-directional, patient- specific Jumpstart will improve outcomes compared to the clinician-facing Jumpstart. We use an innovative hybrid effectiveness-implementation approach to accomplish 3 aims. Aim 1 evaluates the effectiveness of the clinician-facing Jumpstart, compared with usual care, for improving quality of care; the primary outcome is EHR documentation of a goals-of-care discussion during the hospitalization. Secondary outcomes include intensity of care at the end of life. Aim 2 evaluates the effectiveness of the bi-directional, patient-specific Jumpstart compared to the clinician-facing Jumpstart; the primary outcome is the same as Trial 1. We will examine the same secondary outcomes, but also include patient- and family-reported outcomes assessed by surveys at 1 and 3 months after randomization including occurrence and quality of goals-of-care communication in the hospital, goal-concordant care, psychological symptoms, quality of life, and palliative care needs. We will also examine costs of care after accounting for costs of the interventions. In Aim 3, we conduct a mixed-methods evaluation to explore barriers and facilitators to future implementation and dissemination.  Our team has experience conducting innovative multi-center trials with patient-centered outcomes, economic analyses, and implementation science. This novel hybrid effectiveness-implementation approach addresses key knowledge gaps to improve the quality and value of care for older adults.

"Transformative Solutions for Reducing Frequent 911 Fall Calls in the Homes of Patients with Cognitive Impairments PROJECT SUMMARY There is a global upsurge of falls in older adults that impacts nearly every family across the world. Millions of older adults fall each year in the United States, leading to catastrophic injuries, deaths and soaring healthcare costs. Over the last decade, 911 fall calls have tripled while transport rates to the hospital after a fall have significantly decreased. Instead, 911 is increasingly used for lift assists (falls that do not result in transport). Deployment of emergency medical services for lift assists diverts care from higher acuity emergencies and costs more than 200 million dollars annually in the United States. There is a potentially powerful yet underutilized solution if we leverage the hidden opportunities of fall events, such as lift assists that do not result in catastrophic consequences, to activate prevention strategies. This study aims to develop a scalable strategy for early identification of individuals at high risk of falls and activate prevention solutions. We hypothesize that a systematic 911 fall call intake which has a broader concept of frailty, Frailty And Cognition+Environment (FaCE), will better account for the compounding and cascading nature of fall risks in older adults. At the completion of this project a scalable machine learning model which incorporates FaCE factors to predict high utilization of 911 for falls will be developed. In addition, we will characterize barriers and facilitators for adoption, implementation, and maintenance of fall prevention strategies in the home for patients with FaCE risk factors. This project will utilize a blend of systems science and community-based participatory research approaches and state of the art predictive analytics to elucidate the FaCE of falls, develop a scalable fall prevention solution that can be implemented nationwide and inform a larger-scale implementation trial for using 911 fall calls to activate effective fall prevention strategies in homes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Healthcare costs for falls have reached 55 billion dollars annually in the US with falls in older adults impacting nearly every family, in every sector, of every community. Leveraging 911 fall calls as activation events could transform our ability to identify high risk individuals and significantly impact fall prevention strategies. At the completion of this study, a scalable EMS fall prediction tool will be developed to elucidate the impact that frailty, cognitive impairment and the home environment have on emergency fall events in order to activate and transform effective fall prevention solutions in the homes of vulnerable older patients.",Transformative Solutions for Reducing Frequent 911 Fall Calls in the Homes of Patients with Cognitive Impairments,10339728,K76AG068435,"['Adoption ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency medical service ', ' emergency service ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Hospitals ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methods ', ' Paramedical Personnel ', ' Paramedic ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' falls ', ' Fall prevention ', ' preventing falls ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Lifting ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' frailty ', ' Event ', ' Home environment ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' Clinics or Hospitals ', ' Clinics and Hospitals ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Prevention ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' Provider ', ' fall risk ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' Cognitive ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Home visitation ', ' House Call ', ' home visit ', ' implementation trial ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' community based participatory research ', ' community led research ', ' community participatory research ', ' community research ', ' participatory action research ', ' high risk ', ' 911 call ', ' prognostic value ', ' prognostic ability ', ' prognostic power ', ' prognostic utility ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' patient stratification ', ' stratified patient ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' implementation strategy ', ' strategies for implementation ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIA,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,K76,2021,242041,OH-03
"Advanced Development and Utilization of Assembled Aging Trajectory Files from Multiple Datasets PROJECT SUMMARY This goal of this project is to create a unique and comprehensive research repository of aging trajectory da- tasets, related resources, and analytic methods that can be used to answer new and important questions in aging and related sciences. Specifically, by harmonizing and merging multiple data sets this project will gener- ate the data infrastructure needed to understand change over time in care settings, geriatric syndromes, physi- cal functioning, and shared risk factors at multiple levels (patient, provider, community, healthcare system, and society) and across multiple domains (biological, behavioral, sociocultural, and physical/built environments) including chronic conditions and history of acute illness such as COVID-19, exposure to air pollution, neighbor- hood socioeconomic, and health care system factors (Aim 1). Analytic strategies will be developed for user- defined cohorts and their propensity score-matched controls, e.g., older adults who were living with chronic conditions including Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), diabetes, heart failure, end-stage re- nal disease, metastatic cancer, and HIV. State-of-the-art analytic methods are used to identify patterns of ag- ing trajectories (care setting, geriatric syndromes, physical functioning) experienced by older adults during the final years of life and their association with shared risk factors and distal outcomes (Aim 2). From the assem- bled trajectory file in Aim 1, cohorts are derived by aligning an originating index time such as age cutoff point and time at diagnosis (e.g., ADRD, stroke, chronic kidney disease). Both a model-based approach and ma- chine learning algorithms are then used to discover multilevel and potentially interactive predictors of trajecto- ries (e.g., rapid functional decline in independent living beneficiaries) and specific outcomes (e.g., respiratory ventilator usage among Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with COVID-19) (Aim 3). The unique resources are then shared to disseminate resources including datasets, documentation, source code, and methodology (Aim 4). At the end of this project, the research infrastructure to investigate the relationship between shared risk factors and aging trajectories will be ready to use and replicate, giving investigators unprecedented ability to solve new challenges in aging science. This will allow researchers to understand the underlying processes and systems associated with reversible periods of disability across care settings, and interventions that may be used to support recovery of function and reduction of geriatric syndromes including cognitive decline, for the purpose of reducing burdensome care transitions, and maintenance of functional independence. This project will also create the resources and methods needed to evaluate the impact of innovations and interventions im- plemented at the patient, provider, community, healthcare system, and society/policy levels to improve care quality and outcomes for older adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research infrastructure project will harmonize and merge multiple data sets needed to answer new and complex questions about the aging trajectories and health of diverse populations during the universal process of aging.

"Utilizing Technology and AI Approaches to Facilitate Independence and Resilience in Older Adults The overarching goal of this application is to build an Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Technology Collaboratory (AITC) ecosystem that will serve as a national resource to promote the development and implementation of novel AI and technology approaches to improve care and health outcomes for older Americans. The specific aims are: 1) To engage AI and geriatric/gerontology investigators from across the country and to identify, validate, test, and develop new AI and technologies relevant to improving the health and wellbeing of older adults through crucial pilot study mechanisms; 2) To serve as a national resource center that stimulates and leads the development and implementation of effective novel AI and technology approaches and products that will promote the health, wellbeing and independence of all older Americans; 3) To support the engagement of stakeholders in AI research; 4) To build an ecosystem of overlapping innovation and business, academic, and communities- of-practice networks ; and 5) To provide highest quality expertise, support, and infrastructure needed to disseminate technical and policy guidelines and best practices for effectively incorporating AI approaches and technology for older Americans, in partnership with private industry, angel investors, venture capital firms, and healthcare systems. This AITC is directed by a multi-PI interdisciplinary team led by two world-class experienced investigators who have long worked successfully in the fields of AI and technology development areas partnered with investigators who have long and successfully worked at the translational interface that connects real-world medical, cognitive, and functional declines that impact older adults with medical and technological solutions. Each of these investigators has a complementary skill set and a long track records of organizing transdisciplinary teams and consortiums of investigators around core themes. This interdisciplinary, accomplished, and highly visible leadership team will work together to develop vision for the next generation of AI in aging science and to build a scientifically and culturally diverse community of AI scholars and trainees around Aging. To achieve our goals, we designed the JHU AITC to have robust scientific and technological expertise that are described in eight core components. This infrastructure will support the implementation of stakeholder input and the identification of relevant technologies and investigators locally and nationally through a vetting and feasibility testing process of both technology and data processes. It will include a pilot testing phase and related oversight process. We have also established a key partnership with the Iowa office of Rural Health and Veterans Rural Health Resource Centers Leadership and with organizations within Johns Hopkins University that focus on improvements in the health and well-being of older adults in underserved urban communities. Connections with key academic, industry partners have also been established to accelerate the development of relevant technologies into products. This team is dedicated to developing the next AI scientific advances and disseminating resulting strategies into practice and policy that will maximize health, well-being, and independence for older adults. As the number of older adults increases, many older adults live with conditions that profoundly impact their health, well-being, and ability to maintain independence. Artificial Intelligence offers an unprecedented opportunity to mitigate the impact of aging, to arm health care providers with new tools and to empower older adults including those with Alzheimer’s Dementia and their caregivers. The Johns Hopkins AI and Technology Collaboratory ecosystem will serve as a national resource to promote and guide the development and implementation of novel AI and technology approaches to improve care and health outcomes for older Americans.",Utilizing Technology and AI Approaches to Facilitate Independence and Resilience in Older Adults,10274370,P30AG073104,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', '

"Prognostic Implications of Home-Based Blood Pressure Monitoring in Older Adults Hypertension affects over 85% of adults over 75 years of age and represents one of the few modifiable risk factors to prevent dementia and cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in older adults. However, current practice guidelines for hypertension screening and treatment focus heavily on blood pressure (BP) measurements obtained in clinic settings. This reliance on brick-and-mortar offices for BP measurement represents a significant barrier for older adults, who often depend on others for transportation and who are at increased risk of severe morbidity from the current COVID-19 pandemic. Home BP monitoring (HBPM) has shown incredible promise for more effective and timely BP treatment and control. Furthermore, the current pandemic has catalyzed widespread adoption of HBPM for hypertension screening and management. However, evidence for this practice is severely lacking in older adults. In fact, there are virtually no HBPM cohort studies in elderly populations in the United States. This is particularly concerning as the discordance between clinic and home BP increases with age, making older adults especially susceptible to harms from either overly aggressive or delayed BP treatment. In this proposed study, we apply our unique expertise with HBPM and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring to one of the most long-standing and well-respected American cohorts of community-dwelling adults, the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC). While ARIC already rigorously measures BP in the clinic setting via automated devices, our proposal will additionally assess 8 days of HBPM and 24 hours of ambulatory BP (once every 20 minutes) in 2,142 racially diverse adults over age 80 years, establishing possibly the largest prospective study of home, ambulatory, and clinic-based BP measurement among older adults in the world. This proposal is designed to directly inform clinical practice with HBPM by characterizing its measurement performance (bias and variance), predictiveness with respect to key long-term events (dementia and CVD), and interpretation (i.e. what a home BP measure equals in terms of BP measured by ABPM or in clinic). The accomplishment of this proposal will address critical gaps in knowledge related to an increasingly utilized form of BP measurement, improving access to timely hypertension care by establishing an efficient protocol for precise BP measurement at home. Moreover, by investing in the digital monitoring platform of the ARIC study, this proposal will lay the foundation for remote collection of a wide range of detailed, longitudinal, biosensor data that can be leveraged by many investigators through subsequent ARIC proposals in years to come. With current trends in BP control worsening among older adults in the United States, there has never been a greater need for research on innovative technologies to improve access to high quality BP measurement. Ultimately, our proposal directly answers the call by NHLBI's 2017 expert panel on BP measurement for high impact research that determines “the role of ABPM and HBPM in the diagnosis…of hypertension” and “the optimal protocol for using HBPM…to diagnose and assess…hypertension.” High blood pressure is the most prevalent modifiable risk factor for dementia and cardiovascular disease among older adults in the United States; however, clinic-based blood pressure measurement is inaccessible to many older adults, especially in the COVID-19 era, often delaying hypertension diagnosis and treatment. While home- based blood pressure measures show promise for overcoming access barriers and promoting more timely treatment, there is a dearth of evidence informing the clinical interpretation of these measurements inolder adults in the United States, a population characterized by high blood pressure variability and discordance from clinic- based blood pressure. Our proposal will perform home blood pressure monitoring and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring assessments in over 2,100 community-dwelling adults, aged 80-100 years, establishing the measurement performance, prognostic utility (for dementia and cardiovascular disease), and clinical interpretation of home-based blood pressure measurements in this vulnerable population in the United States.",Prognostic Implications of Home-Based Blood Pressure Monitoring in Older Adults,10273144,R01HL158622,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aged, 80 and over ', ' Oldest Old ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Blood Pressure Monitors ', ' Continuous Sphygmomanometers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Joints ', ' Morbidity -

"Multi-omics approach to frailty resilience Frailty is a complex clinical condition that is characterized by increased vulnerability to disability and high risk for mortality in older adults. Identifying biological mechanisms that protect from frailty is an important step in the development of effective therapies that protect from and delay frailty. Aging is a major risk factor for frailty; thus, studying biological mechanisms and populations that delay aging may lead to the identification of molecular factors that can protect from frailty. The biological approaches thus far have mainly focused on descriptive phenotypes, such as inflammatory plasma profile and candidate gene approaches, looking for risk factors for frailty. It is apparent, however, that frailty is a complex syndrome, akin to other complex disorders; thus, simplistic approaches that focus on one genetic variant or inflammatory biomarker at a time are unlikely to yield satisfactory progress. Moreover, to date, few attempts have been made to identify protective biological components of resilience to frailty. This proposal brings together a multidisciplinary team of experts who will tackle these barriers by applying state-of-the-art multi-omics approach to test the hypothesis that unique genomic, epigenomic and proteomic profiles, which are enriched among families with exceptional longevity, are associated with resilience to frailty. Frailty resilience will be quantified using a newly devised and validated measure, the Frailty Resilience Score (FRS), that incorporates the complex biology of frailty by integrating genetic risk in the form of frailty- specific polygenic risk score (PRS), age, and sex. The FRS will be studied in the context of a multi-omics approach to identify the genomic (Aim 1), epigenomic (Aim 2), and proteomic (Aim 3) components that protect from frailty. Whole exome sequencing and SNP arrays will be used to identify gene variants and gene sets associated with frailty resilience (Aim 1). DNA methylation across 850,000 CpG sites will be used for epigenomic discovery (Aim 2) and approximately 5,000 plasma proteins for the proteomic discovery (Aim 3) of resilience markers and pathways. Additionally, integration of proteomics with genomics and epigenomics will be performed to identify common mechanisms and pathways of frailty resilience. These approaches will be applied to a longitudinal cohort of older adults (n=1,400; mean age 76, median follow-up 8 years) from the ongoing LonGenity study, who are annually evaluated with frailty measures, have banked DNA, and whose samples have already been subjected to WES and proteomic analysis. This unique cohort is (1) enriched with protective genes, as half of them are offspring of centenarians and is (2) relatively homogeneous genetically, as all subjects are from an Ashkenazi Jewish founder population, a feature that increases the power for genetic and biological discovery. This multi-omics approach has the potential to both expand our understanding of biology and result in discovery of biomarkers for frailty resilience. Understanding the biologic mechanisms that protect from multi-system failure in older adults is a first step in generating interventions against frailty; while identification of biomarkers will inform us, in the short-term, of the effectiveness of interventions that aim to delay aging and frailty. Project Narrative Frailty is a common clinical condition in older adults that is characterized by increased vulnerability to disability and mortality, and is a major burden for the healthcare system in the United States. Aging is the main risk factor for frailty; however, families of centenarians delay aging and are protected from frailty.

"SCH: INT: Inferring at home gait parameters of older adults using floor vibrations   The United States population is growing older. There is an urgent need for tools to better connect health professionals with their patients and perform at-home assessments in an automated fashion. The long-term goal of this proposal is to discover the knowledge necessary to enable an always-on, non-intrusive, non-wearable smart system for automated at-home gait parameter estimation using floor vibrations. To achieve this vision, the proposal has the objective of connecting health professionals with older adults living independently through a smart system that estimates gait parameters using floor vibration. The aims to achieve this goal are to 1) determine at-home gait parameters as a function of time and space; 2) establish a digital identifier of the older adult based on gait parameters; and 3) correlate changes in at-home gait parameters, after considering spatial-temporal correlations, with changes in the well-being of the resident. The proposed research will advance the state-of-the-art in engineering, physical therapy and public health by testing the following hypotheses: 1) Floor vibration is a viable means to automatically and continuously determine gait parameters; 2) For healthy individuals living in an independent at-home setting, gait parameters will be consistent based on location in the home, time of the day and day of the week; and 3) For patients recently discharged from the hospital, recovery will correlate with improvements in their gait parameters. The testing of the hypotheses will be performed through five tasks: 1) Develop an automated system to capture floor vibration and extract gait parameters; 2) Validate the system in laboratory setting; 3) Collect data at participant’s homes; 4) Test the hypothesis that at-home gait parameters are consistent with time and space; 5) Test the hypothesis that improvement in gait parameters correlates improvement in health status of recently discharged patients. This research will be pursued by a group of interdisciplinary researchers in engineering and physical therapy with the support of an experienced geriatric physician and will advance the knowledge in signal processing techniques, estimation and validation of at-home gait parameters and their uncertainty, and relationship between changes at-home gait parameters and changes in health status. The proposed activities will have a significant impact on older adult care, the research community and the next generation of researchers and engineers stemming from: 1) improved health of older adults and reduced health care cost by early intervening and thus decreasing the readmission rate; 2) increased scientific literacy and public engagement through benchmark problems, interdisciplinary seminars, new courses and outreach activities; 3) the training of diverse convergence researchers competent in solving interdisciplinary problems, including underrepresented groups in STEM fields. The proposed research aligns with the mission of National Institute of Aging by developing automated, non-intrusive, privacy-preserving at-home gait assessment tools based on floor vibrations to correlate changes of gait parameters with the health status of older adults. The outcomes of this project will enable health professionals to monitor the well-being of the older population and manage recovery paradigms thereby improving the health and well-being of older Americans.",SCH: INT: Inferring at home gait parameters of older adults using floor vibrations  ,10188392,R01AG067395,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', ' Communities ', ' Engineering ', ' Controlled Environment ', ' artificial environment ', ' Floor ', ' Gait ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Independent Living ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Physicians ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' vibration ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' outreach ', ' Physiatric Procedure ', ' Physical Medicine Procedure ', ' Physical Therapeutics ', ' Physiotherapy ', ' Physical therapy ', ' Data ', ' Older Population ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Health Professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' National Institute of Aging ', ' digital ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' stem ', ' spatial relationship ', ' STEM field ', ' STEM class ', ' STEM course ', ' STEM discipline ', ' STEM major ', ' science, technology, engineering and math class ', ' science, technology, engineering and math course ', ' science, technology, engineering and math discipline ', ' science, technology, engineering and math field ', ' science, technology, engineering and math major ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics class ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics course ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics discipline ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics field ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics major ', ' signal processing ', ' scientific literacy ', ' scientifically literate ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' under representation of groups ', ' under represented groups ', ' under represented populations ', ' underrepresentation of groups ', ' readmission rates ', ' hospital re-admission rates ', ' hospital readmission rate ', ' re-admission rates ', ' re-hospitalization rate ', ' rehospitalization rate ', ' artificial neural network ', ' artificial neural net ', ' computational neural network ', ' synthetic neural network ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' privacy preservation ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R01,2021,294904,SC-06
"Mechanisms, response heterogeneity and dosing from MRI-derived electric field models in tDCS augmented cognitive training: a secondary data analysis of the ACT study ABSTRACT There is a pressing need for effective interventions to remediate age-related cognitive decline and alter the trajectory toward Alzheimer’s disease. The NIA Alzheimer’s Disease Initiative funded Phase III Augmenting Cognitive Training in Older Adults (ACT) trial aimed to demonstrate that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) paired with cognitive training could achieve this goal. The present study proposes a state of the art secondary data analysis of ACT trial data that will further this aim by 1) elucidate mechanism of action underlying response to tDCS treatment with CT, 2) address heterogeneity of response in tDCS augmented CT by determining how individual variation in the dose of electrical current delivered to the brain interacts with individual brain anatomical characteristics; and 3) refine the intervention strategy of tDCS paired with CT by evaluating methods for precision delivery targeted dosing characteristics to facilitate tDCS augmented outcomes. tDCS intervention to date, including ACT, apply a fixed dosing approach whereby a single stimulation intensity (e.g., 2mA) and set of electrode positions on the scalp (e.g., F3/F4) is applied to all participants/patients. However, our recent work has demonstrated that age-related changes in neuroanatomy as well as individual variability in head/brain structures (e.g., skull thickness) significantly impacts the distribution and intensity of electrical current induced in the brain from tDCS. This project will use person-specific MRI-derived finite element computational models of electric current characteristics (current intensity and direction of current flow) and new methods for enhancing the precision and accuracy of derived models to precisely quantify the heterogeneity of current delivery in older adults. We will leverage these individualized precision models with state-of-the-art support vector machine learning methods to determine the relationship between current characteristics and treatment response to tDCS and CT. We will leverage the inherent heterogeneity of neuroanatomy and fixed current delivery to provide insight in the not only which dosing parameters were associated with treatment response, but also brain region specific information to facilitate targeted delivery of stimulation in future trials. Further still, the current study will also pioneer new methods for calculation of precision dosing parameters for tDCS delivery to potentially optimize treatment response, as well as identify clinical and demographic characteristics that are associated with response to tDCS and CT in older adults. Leveraging a robust and comprehensive behavioral and multimodal neuroimaging data set for ACT with advanced computational methods, the proposed study will provide critical information for mechanism, heterogeneity of treatment response and a pathway to refined precision dosing approaches for remediating age- related cognitive decline and altering the trajectory of older adults toward Alzheimer’s disease. NARRATIVE This secondary data analysis leverages data from an Alzheimer’s Disease Initiative funded Phase III randomized clinical trial examining benefits of transcranial direct current stimulation paired with cognitive training to remediate age-related cognitive decline and alter trajectories toward Alzheimer’s disease. Using advanced neuroimaging-derived computational modeling and artificial intelligence-based machine learning methods, the study will determine the mechanisms underlying response vs. non-response to treatment in older adults and precision dosing parameters for optimizing treatment outcomes.","Mechanisms, response heterogeneity and dosing from MRI-derived electric field models in tDCS augmented

"Individualizing Anticoagulant use in Older Adults with Atrial Fibrillation Project Summary/Abstract  This is a Beeson (K76) career development award for Sachin J Shah, MD, MPH, a physician-investigator trained in internal medicine, clinical epidemiology, and aging research. Dr. Shah is an Assistant Professor in the Division of Hospital Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Shah's long-term goal is to build evidence to individualize treatment recommendations for older adults facing high-risk, high-benefit therapeutic decisions using new epidemiologic methods and geriatric research principles. The decision to use anticoagulants in older adults with atrial fibrillation (AF) is the paradigm of a high-stakes therapeutic decision because while anticoagulants prevent stroke, they increase the risk of bleeding complications. Guidelines use a one-size-fits-all approach; for older adults, they recommend near-universal anticoagulant use. In numerous studies of clinical practice, physicians report concern with the current approach voicing the need to individualize treatment recommendations for older adults. This proposal addresses the pressing need to individualize anticoagulant treatment decisions in older adults with AF through two aims. Aim 1: Develop and validate individualized estimates of the treatment effect of anticoagulants for ischemic stroke prevention in older adults with AF. This aim will use clinical trial and observational data to develop and validate a treatment effect model that will estimate individual-level treatment benefit. Aim 2: Ascertain functional outcomes after major extracranial hemorrhage, both short-term and longer-term. The functional outcomes following major hemorrhage, a key adverse event of anticoagulant therapy, are unclear, especially in older adults. Through two studies, this proposal will determine the short- and long-term functional outcomes following major hemorrhage.  Dr. Shah's exceptional, multidisciplinary mentoring team is led by Dr. Margaret Fang, nationally recognized for her work studying the clinical outcomes of anticoagulants in older adults and co-mentored by Dr. Kenneth Covinsky, whose nationally recognized research program has advanced our understanding of the predictors and outcomes of disability in older adults. This career development award will support Dr. Shah's transition to research independence through mentorship and focused training in (1) measuring heterogeneous treatment effects using novel epidemiologic tools, (2) primary data collection to build prospective cohorts of older adults, (3) designing decision aids and (4) leadership development to lead cross-disciplinary, multi-institutional research teams. This proposal will support a development grant to design and pilot a clinical decision tool for older adults considering anticoagulant and a project grant to measure heterogeneous treatment effects of procedural interventions in older adults with AF. The proposed research and training aims will provide Dr. Shah with the data, training, and experience to support competitive R-series applications. Project Narrative Atrial fibrillation is the most common heart rhythm disorder in older adults, and it substantially increases the risk of disabling strokes. Anticoagulant treatment reduces the risk of stroke but increases the likelihood of disabling bleeding events. We lack a way to individualize treatment decisions for older adults—this proposal will use multiple studies to better define the individual risk and benefits of anticoagulants in older adults with atrial fibrillation.",Individualizing Anticoagulant use in Older Adults with Atrial Fibrillation,10339189,K76AG074919,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Anticoagulants ', ' Anticoagulant Agents ', ' Anticoagulant Drugs ', ' blood thinner ', ' thrombopoiesis inhibitor ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Award ', ' California ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Cryosurgery ', ' Cryoablation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Heart Atrium ', ' Atrial ', ' Cardiac Atrium ', ' atrium ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Internal Medicine ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Placebos ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' sham therapy ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' San Francisco ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' Decision Aid ', ' Decision Modeling ', ' forest ', ' Anticoagulant therapy ', ' Anticoagulant Chemotherapy ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' heart rhythm ', ' cardiac rhythm ', ' Individual ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' frailty ', ' Dependence ', ' Event ', ' Stream ', ' experience ', ' functional status ', ' professor ', ' cohort ', ' functional recovery ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' novel ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' prevent stroke ', ' Stroke prevention ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' Research Training ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' investigator training ', ' Validation ', ' trend ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' treatment effect ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' clinical epidemiology ', ' high risk ', ' clinical practice ', ' individualized medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapeutic strategy ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' leadership development ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' data resource ', ' barrier to care ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' stroke risk ', ' risk for stroke ', ' risk of stroke ', ' side effect ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K76,2021,243000,CA-12
"A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of older adults with chronic health conditions is a challenge our society must address. While the idea of smart environments is now a reality, there remain gaps in our knowledge about how to scale smart homes technologies for use in complex settings and to use machine learning and activity learning technologies to design automated health assessment and intervention strategies. The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The primary objective of this application is to design a “clinician in the loop” smart home to empower individuals in managing their chronic health conditions by automating health monitoring, assessment, and evaluation of intervention impact. Building on our prior work, the approach will be to generate analytics describing an individual's behavior routine using smart homes, smart phones, and activity learning (Aim 1). Our trained clinicians will use the analytics to perform health assessment and detection of health events (Aim 2). In addition, we will introduce brain health interventions to support sustainable improvement of brain health (Aim 3). Finally, we train machine learning algorithms from the clinical observations to automate assessment of health and intervention impact (Aim 4). The use of these technologies is expected to improve and extend the functional health and wellbeing of older adults, lead to more proactive and preventative health care, and reduce the caregiver burden of health monitoring and assistance. By understanding situational factors that impact prompt adherence, adherence situations can be increased. The approach is innovative because it will explore and validate new machine learning techniques for activity learning and health assessment based on clinical ground truth. These contributions are significant because they can extend the health self-management of our aging society through proactive health care and real-time intervention, and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Given nursing home care costs, the impact of family-based care, and the importance that people place on staying at home, technologies that increase functional independence and thus support aging in place while improving quality of life for both individuals and their caregivers are of significant value to both individuals and society. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to design and pilot test a “clinician-in-the-loop” smart home technology to automatically identify health events for adults with chronic conditions in their own homes. The potential health care and social benefits of the proposed work are dramatic as this work will improve the clinical utility, usability and translation of smart home technologies for health assessment and intervention. This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings to generate analytics which reflect behavior routines and can be used for automated health assessment. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through technology-assisted health self-management, reduce caregiver burden and improve quality of life.",A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions,10166954,R01NR016732,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health delivery systems ', ' health services delivery ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Home Nursing Care ', ' Non-Professional Home Care ', ' Non-Professional Homecare ', ' Nonprofessional Home Care ', ' Nonprofessional Homecare ', ' Nursing Homecare ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Intelligence ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Persons ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Societies ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Triage ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Self Management ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Early Intervention ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Restorative Nursing ', ' Rehabilitation Nursing ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' behavior change ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' Emotional ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' care giver stress ', ' caregiver stress ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' cognitive rehab ', ' cognitive rehabilitation ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' telehealth ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Cognitive ', ' technology validation ', ' technology implementation ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Behavior monitoring ', ' behavioral monitoring ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' usability ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention effect ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' Data Analytics ', ' brain health ', ' Preventive healthcare ', ' Preventative health care ', ' Preventative healthcare ', ' Preventive health care ', ' care costs ', ' health management ', ' health care management ', ' healthcare management ', ' health assessment ', ' aging in place ', ' age in place ', ' smart home ', ' functional independence ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' learning algorithm ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' financial burden ', ' financial distress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial stress ', ' Home ', ' ']",NINR,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,352640,WA-05
"Massachusetts AI and Technology Center for Connected Care in Aging and Alzheimer's Disease (MAITC) PROJECT SUMMARY: Overall More than 90% of older Americans would prefer to stay in their homes as long as possible as they age. However, the prevalence of chronic illness including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's disease related dementias (ADRD) can make the goal of successful aging at home out of reach without substantial support. At- home health care technologies hold significant promise to provide many needed forms of support, but have not been specifically developed for older adults, AD/ADRD patients, caregivers, and their clinicians. Many existing health monitoring technologies are burdensome to use for older adults, are not sufficiently accurate, have specific algorithmic biases, and lack adequate usability, and the resulting deluge of data often fails to provide information that can usefully inform caregivers and support clinical decisions. Further, many current treatment and intervention regimes are limited in terms of their ability to be remotely delivered, managed and adapted to patient needs and caregiver abilities over time. The Massachusetts AI and Technology Center for Connected Care in Aging and Alzheimer's Disease (MAITC) is a multidisciplinary Center spanning five sites – the University of Massachusetts Amherst, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital, Brandeis University and Northeastern University – that aims to foster interdisciplinary research on the development, validation and translation of emerging AI- enhanced technologies to enhance connections between older adults, caregivers, and clinicians in order to more effectively support healthy aging as well as the care of patients with AD/ADRD at home. To achieve this objective, MAITC will pursue the five aims. The first is to apply a rigorous process which involves eliciting stakeholder needs to drive the foci of pilot studies and identifying promising technologies suitable for incorporation into pilot research projects. The second is to form and support a multidisciplinary community of engineers, computer scientists, behavioral scientists, medical researchers, nurses and clinicians working to advance the goals of the MAITC. The third is to provide access to state-of-art validation facilities, diverse cohorts across rural and urban areas, and translation and commercialization services to enable rapid, robust and multi-faceted validation and translation of AI-enhanced technologies. The fourth is to administer a pilot project granting process and ensure that the pilot projects are responsive to stakeholder needs, use emerging AI and related technologies that have significant potential to improve interactions between older adults, lay caregivers, and clinicians. The fifth is to provide training to developers, clinicians, and other stakeholders and to disseminate findings to diverse research, development and practice communities to accelerate further development of promising technologies and promote the adoption of validated technologies beyond the MAITC. Through these coordinated efforts, we hope to improve the lives of older adults and their caregivers. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Massachusetts AI and Technology Center for Connected Care in Aging and Alzheimer's Disease (MAITC) seeks to develop and validate health monitoring devices and artificial intelligence technologies to support healthy aging and Alzheimer's Disease care.

"Sense4Safety: Supporting socially vulnerable older adults Abstract Falls and fall-related injuries are significant public health issues for adults 65 years of age and older. Over a third of older adults (OA) fall each year and 10-20% of falls result in serious injuries such as fractures and head trauma. The annual direct medical costs in the US as a result of falls are estimated to exceed $50 billion, and this estimate does not include the indirect costs of disability, dependence, and decreased quality of life. This project targets community dwelling OA with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who are socially vulnerable. MCI is a leading risk factor for falls in OA. Approximately 15%-20% of OA have MCI, and over 60% of OA with MCI fall annually – two to three times the rate of those without cognitive impairment. Socially vulnerable OA living in low-resource neighborhoods with poor housing conditions have twice the risk of falling. We have developed an innovative technology-supported nursing-driven intervention called Sense4Safety to 1) identify escalating risk for falls real-time through in-home passive sensor monitoring (including depth and motion sensors); 2) employ machine learning to inform individualized alerts for fall risk; and 3) link `at risk' socially vulnerable older adults with a nurse tele-coach who will guide them in implementing evidence-based individualized plans to reduce fall-risk. The purpose of this study is to refine the Sense4Safety intervention based on extensive feedback by low income OA with MCI, their family members or trusted others and clinicians in order to ensure that the passive monitoring system to predict fall risk for OA with MCI can generate actionable and tailored information that can be used effectively by these stakeholder groups. Project Narrative The proposed research study aims to refine an innovative technology-supported nursing-driven intervention called Sense4Safety to 1) identify escalating risk for falls real-time through in-home passive sensor monitoring (including depth and motion sensors); 2) employ machine learning to inform individualized alerts for fall risk; and 3) link `at risk' socially vulnerable older adults with a nurse tele-coach who will guide them in implementing evidence-based individualized plans to reduce fall-risk.

"Development of a Digital Cognitive Screening Test to detect Mild Cognitive Impairment and Dementia in Clinical Settings. Project Summary Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias are a growing health problem in our aging population. Assessment of cognitive functioning for early detection is critical to identify individuals who might benefit from treatment with the available symptomatic medications for mild dementia as well as future disease-modifying therapies that are actively under development and being tested in clinical research trials. Current cognitive screening tools are time-consuming and not routinely used or documented in busy primary care settings. As a result, we need easily accessible tools, such as patient self-administered measures, to screen individuals in primary care settings to guide counseling, referrals, and interventions. The proposed STTR Phase I project aims to develop and test an innovative digital cognitive screening instrument, RIMCAT (Rhode Island Mobile Cognitive Assessment Tool) to identify mild cognitive impairment and dementia in older adults. RIMCAT consists of 10 components and was designed for self-administration in supervised settings such as primary care practices and provides a cognitive-friendly interface allowing voice inputs, keyboard typing, and easy-to-understand instructions. The goal of this STTR project is to examine the initial reliability and validity of RIMCAT through a psychometric study. The project also includes the development of a digital health framework to support the workflow of MCI/dementia screening. This work will establish the usability of RIMCAT among older adults who could undergo the screening assessment on a digital platform, regardless of their ability to use modern mobile technologies. Project Narrative This STTR Phase I proposal aims to develop and test an innovative digital cognitive screening instrument, to identify mild cognitive impairment and dementia in older adults. We will conduct a feasibility study to measure the initial reliability and validity of the instrument on 30 cognitively healthy older adults and 30 with cognitive impairment. We will develop a digital health framework to support the administration and scoring of RIMCAT in the current workflow.

"Detecting Medical Emergencies in Isolated Older Adults Living Alone in Rural Areas Abstract Isolated older persons living alone in a rural house are at risk of being in medical distress without help. A rural house can be isolated from neighbors who can easily check on their well-being. As these people become elderly, they can have a high preference to stay in their home as long they believe they can care for themselves. An elderly person alone and in distress can be in a life and death situation in an isolated rural home. In an isolated rural house, many days can pass before someone decides to drive to their location to check on the elderly person. This project develops a low-cost monitoring solution for isolated rural elderly to safely lead independent lives. The phase I SBIR project will develop a wireless indoor tracking system to detect a person's location through several walls of a typical rural house. There will be no cables to run or need to install a complex array of sensors through the house. The cost of installation inexpensive. The system will have battery backup and protocols to operate over long power outages. It will also have a cell phone backup communication option should phone lines be down. The system will identify motions of the elderly person 24 hours a day in the house. Machine Learning (ML) Algorithms can detect abnormalities from their daily routine. The product is intended to be an optional accessory to in-home alert systems in use today and work with multiple vendors of in-home alert systems. It will operate in parallel with wearable buttons to signal an alert. Once the system identifies a distress event has occurred it will activate the alert system the same way as a wearable button press. The same alert protocol would be followed. In these systems an operator would first try to talk to the person with a speaker phone of the vendors' in-home alert system. If they cannot communicate with the person, they start working through a call list of local people to check on the home. The phase I will develop and test the wireless indoor tracking system and the Machine Learning (ML) Algorithms. Project Narrative Of the 60 million people living in rural United States, 15% are aged 65 years or older. People aged 70 and older constitute 13% of the population, but account for 20% of hospital treated falls and 70% of deaths. Falls lead the cause-of-injury deaths and nonfatal injury in people 65 and older, and over 30% of these require medical treatment and are sufficiently severe to make independent living difficult.",Detecting Medical Emergencies in Isolated Older Adults Living Alone in Rural Areas,10400417,R43MD017157,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', ' Beds ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Engineering ', ' Grant ', ' Hospitals ', ' Independent Living ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Persons ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Vendor ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Friends ', ' falls ', ' Family member ', ' Caring ', ' Spouses ', ' Married Persons ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' rural area ', ' rural location ', ' rural region ', ' sensor ', ' Left ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Distress ', ' Rural ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' Devices ', ' Napping ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Data ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Validation ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' wireless ', ' Monitor ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' prototype ', ' Medical emergency ', ' Cloud Service ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' feasibility testing ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIMHD,APPLIED UNIVERSAL DYNAMICS CORPORATION,R43,2021,260303,MN-03
"Investigation of brain mechanisms involved in the Urinary Continence mechanism associated with aging PROJECT SUMMARY Prevalent, morbid, and costly ($66 billion/year in 2007), incontinence is a major problem, especially for older adults, in whom the most common type is urgency incontinence (UUI). Generally ascribed to bladder spasms, UUI's actual causes are unknown, and therapy remains inadequate. Recent data suggest that one cause is poor bladder control by the brain. In our recent R01 we used biofeedback (BFB) as a probe to explore this. The exciting findings suggest that one `phenotype' of UUI in older adults seems to be caused by a breakdown in brain control, which can be restored by successful behavioral therapy, while another is refractory. Our proposed new study will explore this further by attempting to differentiate the mechanisms associated with disease and aging. The goal is to identify which brain mechanisms should be suppressed because they are contributing to or causing UUI, which should be enhanced because they are helping to compensate for UUI, and which should be ignored because they are incidental to aging and not related to UUI. Current data suggest that bladder control comprises 3 cerebral circuits that maintain continence by suppressing the voiding reflex in the midbrain. In our UUI phenotype that responded to BFB, the mechanism involved enhancing deactivation of the first brain circuit (medial prefrontal cortex, mPFC) which resulted in less activation of the second circuit (which includes the midcingulate cortex). In the phenotype that was resistant to BFB, no brain changes were seen. Yet, although we have an emerging picture of the brain's role in UUI, we have only rudimentary understanding of what is `normal', i.e. how the brain normally controls the bladder. More relevant, we do not know whether this control mechanism is the same across the lifespan, or if it changes owing to the impact of aging. Thus, our overall aim is to characterize continence control in both young and old people, and examine how changes due to bladder control failure differ in each age group. Our specific aims are to characterize normal voiding in the continent old and young in order to better understand and verify the working model and to use the comparison to older adults with UUI to understand the mechanism of brain failure in these individuals. To address these aims, we will conduct a detailed clinical and neuroimaging study to study 80 asymptomatic women and 80 UUI women, each group divided equally into young (18-45) and old (65+ years). The study will enable us to evaluate the changes in brain structure and function and to identify brain mechanisms involved in continence control, changes due to aging (both benign and contributory to UUI), and changes due to disease. The study will provide the comprehensive data on brain mechanisms involved in the normal continence mechanism in order to better corroborate our working model, understand the aging process, and assess targets for therapy. It will thereby enable scientists to develop novel and more effective new therapies based on the revolution in neuroscience—and more hope for UUI sufferers. PROJECT NARRATIVE Urge urinary incontinence is a common problem in older people which vastly reduces quality of life, yet the cause and mechanism of disease are not well understood. This study will characterize brain control of the bladder in young and old continent individuals and age-matched wet counterparts. This will expand our current knowledge of how the brain controls the bladder, better characterize the `ideal' mechanism and suggest ways in which we can better target treatment.",Investigation of brain mechanisms involved in the Urinary Continence mechanism associated with aging,10263175,R01AG065288,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Biofeedback ', ' Bladder ', ' Bladder Urinary System ', ' urinary bladder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' Incontinence ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Midbrain structure ', ' Mesencephalon ', ' Mid-brain ', ' Midbrain ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Phenotype ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Spasm ', ' Hyperkinesia ', ' Hyperkinesis ', ' Hyperkinetic Movements ', ' Muscle Spasm ', ' Muscular Spasm ', ' Urinary Incontinence ', ' Woman ', ' micturition urgency ', ' Urgency to pass urine ', ' Urgent desire to urinate ', ' urinary urgency ', ' urination urgency ', ' Mediating ', ' Urge Incontinence ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Medial ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Refractory ', ' Premenopause ', ' Pre-Menopause ', ' Pre-menopausal Period ', ' Premenopausal ', ' Premenopausal Period ', ' pre-menopausal ', ' Failure ', ' Bladder Dysfunction ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Cerebrum ', ' cerebral ', ' Therapeutic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Reaction ', ' bladder continence ', ' micturition control ', ' urinary continence ', ' urinary control ', ' urination control ', ' Bladder Control ', ' age group ', ' brain control ', ' mind control ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' cost ', ' Micturition Reflex ', ' voiding reflex ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' predicting response ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' brain dysfunction ', ' dysfunctional brain ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' recruit ', ' side effect ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,612748,PA-18
"electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to Prevent FallS (eSTEPS). ABSTRACT Recent meta-analyses have found that participation in the appropriate fall-prevention exercise program for an older adult reduces the risk of falls by 23% in relative terms, for an absolute reduction of 0.20 falls per person per year. Many guidelines, including the US Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF), recommend that older adults at risk of falls are referred to appropriate fall-prevention exercise programs (USPSTF Level B). Despite this evidence, many older adults do not receive appropriate referrals and support for fall-prevention exercises, with one study finding that less than half of older persons report discussing their falls with their primary care providers (PCPs). Older people living in rural areas are more likely to fall but are less likely to participate in fall prevention programs. Advances in computing technology can help to identify older people at risk of falls and disseminate guidance about the most effective interventions using clinical decision support (CDS) systems. Patients can be supported in their exercise programs through a patient-focused App distributed through the PCP or through content on their patient portal. Well-implemented CDS that is integrated into the electronic health record (EHR) can support prescribing or recommending effective strategies and engaging patients in fall prevention decision-making thus integrating evidence-based guidelines into clinical practice. The long-term goal of our research program is to enhance the safety of community-based older adults by reducing falls through an effective patient-centered learning health system called eSTEPS (electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to Prevent FallS). With eSTEPS, an exercise algorithm will be integrated into the EHR which will trigger a Best Practice Alert (BPA) and Smart Set to provide actionable CDS within primary care clinic workflows and facilitate the use of CDS with patients to ensure evidence-based recommendations are tailored to patient preferences. The resulting fall prevention exercise care plan will be sent to the EHR as a note and to a patient-facing App for the patient to view after their visit. In this proposal we will use traditional fall risk screening and machine learning approaches to accurately identify older adults at risk for falls. We will then develop, CDS implemented into the electronic health record that helps primary care providers and older patients develop a tailored fall prevention exercise plan. We will conduct a cluster randomized control trial in urban and rural primary care clinics to test the efficacy of the eSTEPS CDS intervention. Development of the eSTEPS CDS within the widely adopted Epic EHR will support dissemination of evidence for older adults, with a focus on rural elders. NARRATIVE There is substantial evidence that conducting multifactorial fall risk assessments and developing personalized prevention plans in primary care settings can reduce falls, but many barriers exist to integrating this evidence into practice. The US Preventive Service Task Force recommends fall prevention exercises for community- dwelling adults who are at increased risk for falls, however less than half of older persons report discussing their falls with their primary care providers (PCPs). The goal of this project is to develop, test, and evaluate shareable, standards-based fall prevention clinical decision support, eSTEPS (electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to Prevent FallS) that can used by primary care providers to facilitate personalized activity and exercise prescriptions and reduce falls in at risk older adults.",electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to Prevent FallS (eSTEPS).,10238835,R61AG068926,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Exercise ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Learning ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' falls ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Fall prevention ', ' preventing falls ', ' Caring ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' rural location ', ' rural region ', ' improved ', ' Ensure ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Rural ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Clinic ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' behavior change ', ' Visit ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Prevention program ', ' Reporting ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' fall risk ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Prevention Guidelines ', ' neighborhood safety ', ' community safety ', ' evidence based guidelines ', ' Evidence based practice guidelines ', ' evidence based recommendations ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' usability ', ' high risk ', ' control trial ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' primary care setting ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' clinical practice ', ' efficacy testing ', ' screening ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' individualized prevention ', ' personalized prevention ', ' precision prevention ', ' clinically actionable ', ' exercise prescription ', ' exercise program ', ' fitness program ', ' fall injury ', ' fall related injury ', ' injurious falls ', ' Preventive service ', ' Preventative service ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' smartphone Application ', ' Android App ', ' Android Application ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smartphone App ', ' iOS app ', ' iOS application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iPhone Application ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' patient portal ', ' clinical decision support ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' implementation protocol ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R61,2021,243761,MA-07
