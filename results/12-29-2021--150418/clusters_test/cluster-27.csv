"MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER Project Summary Head and neck cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the United States, with an overall survival rate of around 50%. Compared to other subsites of head and neck cancer, the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer is increasing and has been intimately linked to human papillomavirus (HPV). Most oropharyngeal cancer patients receive standard therapy. However, clinical outcomes vary significantly and are difficult to predict. Thus, more robust prognostic biomarkers are needed to accurately stratify patients for the risk of treatment failures.  The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays and therapeutic agents for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNA molecules that collectively control the expression of thousands of protein-coding genes. miRNAs are extensively involved in tumorigenesis and they have deregulated expression in human cancers. Recent studies indicate that miRNAs are promising biomarkers and play critical regulatory roles in many types of cancer. However, the prognostic and therapeutic values of miRNAs in oropharyngeal cancer are poorly characterized to date. Our preliminary analysis has identified six miRNAs that are predictive of oropharyngeal cancer outcome. Here, we propose to significantly expand our preliminary study to identify new miRNA biomarkers by analyzing all oropharynx-related miRNAs in a large number of oropharyngeal tumors. These miRNA biomarkers will then be combined to build a robust model for significantly improved prognosis of oropharyngeal cancer. Further, the therapeutic potential of selected prognostic miRNAs will be evaluated by characterizing the roles of these miRNAs in cancer progression and treatment response. RELEVANCE Although the overall incidence of head and neck cancer has decreased steadily in the past decades, the number of reported oropharyngeal cancer cases has increased significantly. The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs, which are a class of small non-coding RNAs that play important regulatory roles in tumorigenesis.",MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER,10238766,R01DE026471,"['Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Family ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' wart virus ', ' Methods ', ' Oropharyngeal Neoplasms ', ' Oropharyngeal Tumor ', ' Oropharynx Neoplasms ', ' Oropharynx Tumor ', ' oral pharyngeal neoplasm ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' malignant oropharynx neoplasm ', ' Malignant Oropharyngeal Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Oropharyngeal Tumor ', ' Oropharnyx Cancers ', ' Oropharyngeal Cancer ', ' Oropharyngeal Carcinoma ', ' Oropharynx Cancer ', ' Oropharynx Carcinoma ', ' malignant oropharynx tumor ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' therapy failure ', ' base ', ' tumor progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' prognostic ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Head and Neck Cancer ', ' Malignant Head and Neck Neoplasm ', ' head/neck cancer ', ' malignant head and neck tumor ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Therapeutic Agents ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Oropharynx ', ' Oropharynxs ', ' oral pharyngeal ', ' Oropharyngeal ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer-directed therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' Micro RNA ', ' miRNA ', ' miRNAs ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' Institution ', ' Oncogenesis ', ' tumorigenesis ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cancer Prognosis ', ' Validation ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer type ', ' prospective ', ' Oncogenic ', ' tumor ', ' high risk ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' screening ', ' miRNA expression profiling ', ' MicroRNA Expression Profiling ', ' global miRNA profiling ', ' miRNA sequencing ', ' miRNA-seq ', ' micro RNA expression profiling ', ' microRNA profiling ', ' microRNA sequencing ', ' patient stratification ', ' stratified patient ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' patient biomarkers ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' microRNA biomarkers ', ' miRNA biomarkers ', ' miRNA markers ', ' microRNA markers ', ' prognostic assays ', ' prognostic test ', ' treatment risk ', ' prognostic model ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,378722,IL-07
"High-throughput detection of transcriptomic and epitranscriptomic variation and kinetics using MarathonRT Project Summary The discovery and characterization of an efficient, ultraprocessive reverse transcriptase (MarathonRT) now makes it possible to develop high-throughput methods for accurate end-to- end sequencing of long RNA transcripts, thereby preserving information content on alternative splicing, editing and modification isoforms while conserving positional linkage information, thereby enabling one to distinguish RNA isoforms in complex mixtures without mapping to a reference genome. This type of technology is essential for deciphering the role of post- transcriptional RNA processing events during control of developmental stage, cell and tissue specificity and regulation of gene expression in higher organisms. It must be sufficiently efficient and accurate to power the long-read sequencing approaches that are used in single- cell RNAseq, particularly when transcript diversification is monitored as a function of time. The first two aims of the proposal are focused on high-throughput detection of RNA modifications (such as 2-O-methyl groups and N7-methyl guanosines). In the first aim, a unique MarathonRT primer extension protocol will be combined with a trained mutational profiling algorithm to recognize the positions and chemical identities of specific RNA modifications, reporting a modification signature that can be recognized at high throughput during long-read sequencing (MRT-ModSeq). In the second aim, MRT-ModSeq will be tested on unknown RNAs, where it will be used to predict sites of modifications on challenging long transcripts and robustness of the predictions will be directly evaluated using mass spectrometry. The second half of the proposal is focused on identification of linked alternative splicing and editing sites on long transcripts within complex cellular mixtures. In aim 3, MarathonRT will be incorporated into a workflow for accurately profiling the relative abundance and processing diversity of the highly complex paralytic (para) gene, which encodes more than 1 million possible processing variants, a subset of which are essential for the voltage-gating of a sodium channel. This sets the stage for Aim 4, in which sensitivity of the workflow must be further optimized and merged with data analysis strategies suitable for time-resolved single cell applications. The resulting method will be tested by monitoring full-length transcriptomic signatures induced by cell stress. Project Narrative Relevance: A single DNA gene produces many different RNA molecules that differ in size and composition, and each of them plays a distinct role in cellular function and the life of an organism. We are creating new RNA sequencing methods that will enable us to monitor all of these isoforms individually, making it possible to determine their specific roles in human health and disease",High-throughput detection of transcriptomic and epitranscriptomic variation and kinetics using MarathonRT,10276105,R01HG011868,"['Algorithms ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Complementary DNA ', ' cDNA ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Digestion ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA Damage ', ' DNA Injury ', ' Doxorubicin ', ' 14-Hydroxydaunomycin ', ' Adriamycine ', ' Doxorubicina ', ' Hydroxyl Daunorubicin ', ' Hydroxyldaunorubicin ', ' Drosophila genus ', ' Drosophila ', ' fruit fly ', ' Evolution ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Guanosine ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Ions ', ' Kinetics ', ' Medicine ', ' Metals ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Play ', ' Pseudouridine ', ' RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase ', ' EC 2.7.7.49 ', ' RNA Transcriptase ', ' RNA-Dependent DNA Polymerase ', ' Reverse Transcriptase ', ' Revertase ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Post-Transcriptional RNA Processing ', ' Post-Transcriptional RNA Modification ', ' Posttranscriptional RNA Processing ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Transfer RNA ', ' Triplet Codon-Amino Acid Adaptor ', ' tRNA ', ' transfer Ribonucleic acids ', ' viral RNA ', ' virus RNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sodium Channel ', ' Sodium Ion Channels ', ' Specificity ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thiouridine ', ' 4-Thiouridine ', ' 4-thio-uridine ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translations ', ' RNase P ', ' Ribonuclease P ', ' Catalytic RNA ', ' Ribozymes ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Repetitive Sequence ', ' Repetitive Element ', ' Repetitive Regions ', ' cofactor ', ' Label ', ' Site ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Heat-Shock Response ', ' Heat Shock ', ' Heat-Shock Reaction ', ' Metabolic ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Event ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' Palsy ', ' Plegia ', ' paralysis ', ' paralytic ', ' Paralysed ', ' interest ', ' methyl group ', ' nuclease ', ' Isoforms ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' voltage ', ' Structure ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' cDNA Library ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' performance tests ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' RNA synthesis ', ' RNA chemical synthesis ', ' Length ', ' Detection ', ' Primer Extension ', ' Cell Cycle Kinetics ', ' Cell Kinetics ', ' Cellular Stress ', ' cell stress ', ' Transcript ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Population ', ' transcriptomics ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' sequencing platform ', ' reference genome ', ' reference assembly ', ' preservation ', ' epitranscriptomics ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' computational suite ', ' implementation facilitation ', ' ']",NHGRI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,1005089,CT-03
"Cell free RNA liquid biopsies ABSTRACT The ultimate goal of this proposal is to verify an RNA liquid biopsy platform and transition it to have specific utility for the study, and non-invasive assessment, of the hematopoietic bone marrow (BM) niche. In addition to their reliance of material excreted from dying, diseased cells, cell-free DNA (cfDNA) platforms are limited to primarily detecting changes in somatic genomic sequence, copy number, or methylation status. Many biological and clinical events, such as hematopoiesis, fibrosis, and tumorigenesis, are executed via global changes in transcriptional regulation. My PhD advisor Dr. Daniel Kim and I have established a platform for exRNA liquid biopsy in human blood-plasma that has demonstrated significant diagnostic and monitoring potential in both Pancreatic cancer and COVID-19 patients. I propose to continue this research to complete my PhD by assessing diagnostic performance of the exRNA platform in a new cohort of 60 lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients with matched controls. Furthermore, I will apply my expertise in exRNA liquid biopsies to assay the transcriptional dynamics of hematopoiesis and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow (BM) niche. Currently, bone marrow biopsies or aspirations are used to determine bone marrow health and production. These techniques are costly and require sedation and/or pain relief for the subject and have the potential to lead to long term discomfort, infection, excessive bleeding, and other side-effects. BM aspirations remain a critical diagnostic and monitoring tool for HSC transplant recovery, leukemias and lymphomas, blood cell pathologies, and infections of unknown origin but the primary readout remains identification and counting of cell types. I hypothesize that hematopoietic lineages within the BM secrete exRNA that reflect cell state and identity that can be used in a non-invasive RNA liquid biopsy for detailed study of transcription and populations within the BM. I propose to identify exRNA expressed and secreted by HSCs and the remaining hematopoietic lineage in order to develop a platform to deconvolute peripheral blood into constituent hematopoietic cell types without the need for HSC mobilization. NARRATIVE Liquid biopsies are poised to revolutionize diagnostic procedures by making them more accessible and less invasive due to the use of biofluids like blood rather than tissue samples. During my PhD I have helped develop an RNA liquid biopsy platform that the F99 will enable me to lead a validation for in patients diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma. As an NIDDK K00 fellow, I will expand the RNA liquid biopsy platform into a hematological context that will identify extracellular RNA markers of the hematopoietic lineage in- and ex-vivo.",Cell free

"Revealing Principles of Subcellular RNA Localization by Proximity Labeling PROJECT SUMMARY The human body comprises of trillion of cells, which are the building blocks of life. Each cell is highly organized, with various constituents within localizing to specific regions. Location within a cell is a cardinal organizing principle of gene control and function, especially for RNAs that code for proteins or serve regulatory roles as non-coding RNAs. Each cell type has its distinct RNA-species profile, and where these RNAs are located within the cell can dictate their folding, editing, splicing, translation, degradation, binding partners, catalytic activity, and even the fate of the proteins that they encode. Unsurprisingly, perturbations in RNA localization result in disease conditions including cancers and neuropathologies. In spite of the vital importance of subcellular RNA localization in gene expression, investigating such phenomena simultaneously for many RNA species has been challenging. To address these long-standing issues, Dr. Furqan Fazal and others have recently developed a technique called APEX-seq that can track the location of thousands of RNAs in living human cells with high-temporal and nanometer-spatial resolution. APEX-seq has the transformative potential to provide high-resolution snapshots of tens of thousands of endogenous cellular RNA species, free from artifacts of overexpression, cell fixation or recombinant tagging. This proposal outlines a five-year career program for Dr. Fazal as he investigates principles of RNA subcellular localization, and reaches milestone goals that will transition him into an independent investigator. By improving the APEX-seq technique and amalgamating it with a number of cutting-edge tools including massively-parallel reporter assays and deep-learning-based approaches, Dr. Fazal will dissect how sequences within RNAs direct them to different locations, and how cells actively control RNA subcellular localization to regulate gene function. This work will be carried out at Stanford University, where Dr. Fazal will be mentored by Dr. Howard Chang, a pioneer in developing new genomics tools, and Dr. Joanna Wysocka, a leading authority in vertebrate development and non-coding genomic regulatory elements. Both mentors have highly-successful track records of placing postdoctoral fellows into independent academic positions at leading institutions around the nation and world. Additional support will be available through collaboration with Drs. Shen, Boettiger and Kundaje who will provide training and expertise in genetics, imaging, statistics and computation. An advisory committee comprising of world-leading investigators Drs. Ting, Kool, Li, Bryant and Bassik will also monitor progress and provide expertise. Further acquisition of scientific and professional skills will be achieved by utilizing the educational resources available through the Stanford University School of Medicine and Office of Postdoctoral Affairs. Stanford provides an outstanding intellectually-stimulating environment with all facilities and resources necessary for success, and all proposed training will complement Dr. Fazal’s previous knowledge in genomics and biophysics and facilitate his transition into a multidisciplinary RNA biologist in the field of spatial transcriptomics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Many RNA species within a cell are spatially localized and locally translated into proteins, and previous studies in embryos, neurons and highly-dynamic tissues have demonstrated the vital importance of RNA subcellular location in development and cellular function. However, it has been challenging to study localization transcriptome-wide, which has hampered understanding of the extent and role of such processes in normal and diseased tissues. The proposed work will improve a newly-developed tool for the RNA community to investigate spatial transcriptomics, and use it to provide new insights into RNA biology by determining the regulatory sequences (i.e. the grammar) controlling localization, as well as identifying the associated cellular mechanisms.",Revealing Principles of Subcellular RNA Localization by Proximity

"Robust identification and accurate quantification of RNA transcripts on a system wide scale Contact PD/PI: Li, Jingyi Project Summary Next-generation, Illumina RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is by far the most widely used assay for investigating animal transcriptomes, and numerous public RNA-seq data sets have been generated for various biological conditions in multiple species. However, there remain several barriers in using short RNA-seq reads to accurately identify the splicing structures and quantify the abundances of full-length RNA transcripts. In this proposal, we will develop a series of novel statistical and computational methods to improve the robustness of transcript identification and the accuracy of transcript quantification from Illumina RNA-seq data. (Aim 1) We will develop a novel screening method to construct transcript candidates by first detecting sparse splicing structures from multiple RNA-seq data sets for a given biological condition. These transcript candidates will significantly reduce the search space of downstream transcript identification methods and hence improve their precision. (Aim 2) We will develop a robust transcript identification method to identify novel transcripts in a conservative manner from RNA-seq data given existing annotations. Our method will be based on statistical model selection under the Neyman-Pearson paradigm, which will allow users to control the false positive rate of our identified novel transcripts under any given threshold with high probability. (Aim 3) We will develop an accurate transcript quantification method to effectively leverage multiple RNA-seq data sets and to simultaneously assess the data quality based on low-throughput gold standards and cross-data similarities. All of these methods will be first used to study transcripts in mouse macrophage, for which gold standard qPCR and full length cDNA sequences will be generated for training and method validation. The methods will then be more broadly tested in other biological systems where suitable gold standard data is available. Our methods and software will significantly facilitate the use of Illumina RNA-seq data for gene expression studies at the transcript level, increase reproducibility of scientific discoveries from transcriptomic studies, and improve our understanding of gene expression mechanisms in various biological conditions. Project Summary/Abstract Page 6 Contact PD/PI: Li, Jingyi Project Narrative This project will create a set of computational methods to improve the robustness and accuracy of detecting and quantifying RNA molecules from next-generation RNA sequencing data. Those methods will serve as useful tools for investigating gene expression changes in different biological conditions on a finer scale at the transcript level. We will distribute the methods in open-source software packages to benefit the scientific and biomedical communities.

"Mechanism-based Targeting of the RNA Processing Machinery of SARS-CoV-2 ABSTRACT The massive global pandemic with high morbidity and mortality makes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) one of the deadliest viruses in recent history. It is especially noteworthy for hijacking the normal operations of human cells. To develop effective therapies, we need a better understanding of the mechanisms that permit the virus to invade cells and evade host immune restriction. SARS-CoV-2 encodes the non-structural protein (nsp)16/nsp10 protein complex that transfers a methyl group from S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) to 2’-OH of the first transcribing nucleotide of the viral mRNA and thus converts the Cap-0 (m7GpppA) to Cap-1 (m7GpppAm). The resulting viral mRNA mimics host cell’s mRNA. In this way, a cell cannot distinguish between its own RNA and that of the virus. This modification of the virally encoded mRNA not only tricks the immune system and helps the virus to take over the host translation machinery for synthesis of its own proteins for survival and propagation. Ablation of nsp16 activity should trigger an immune response to viral infection and limit pathogenesis. Our recent paper in Nature Communications described atomic level details of the nsp16/nsp10 complex and how the enzyme is well adapted to bind the RNA cap and exert the 2’-OH methylation. We also discovered a distant pocket (located 25Å away from the catalytic center) in nsp16 that is unique to SARS-CoV-2. We also found that this pocket in nsp16 is partially composed of amino acids that are unique to SARS-CoV-2. It can bind small molecules outside of the catalytic center. We propose to build a long- term research program aimed at deciphering the factors crucial to the maintenance of RNA genome and evasion from the host’s immune response. Our studies will reveal basic principles underlying SARS-CoV-2 RNA cap modification, the mode of nucleoprotein (NP) assembly, interplay with mRNA, and new approaches for therapeutic targeting. In Aim 1, we will resolve a series of new structures of nsp16/nsp10 proteins captured in every step of the methyl transfer by X-ray crystallography. The structural data will be validated by detailed biochemical and biophysical studies. We will resolve the biochemical and structural determinants of the assembly of viral RNA capping machinery, and identify factors underlying integrity of RNA genome. In Aim 2, we will develop a novel molecular tool to study temporal distribution of the RNA methylation during viral infection. We will examine new models for combinatorial inhibition of viral proteins by drug repurposing or novel small molecules. Finally, we will use our recently established reverse genetics approaches based on the use of a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) to generate recombinant (r)SARS-CoV2 containing mutations in nsp16 to determine their contribution in viral replication in cultured cells and pathogenesis in vivo using our recently described K18 human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). NARRATIVE The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) can hijack the normal operations of human cells, which makes it especially dangerous. It encodes a set of nonstructural proteins (nsp) to protect its RNA genome from host degradation and immune restriction. Our studies will combine biochemical, structural, cellular, and genomic approaches to address fundamental questions related to RNA modification, host immune restriction, viral growth and pathogenesis, and develop new molecular tools to collectively inform new COVID- 19 treatments and protect ourselves against future coronaviral infections.",Mechanism-based Targeting of the RNA Processing Machinery

"Analysis of the Molecular Machinery Regulating Gene Expression during Vertebrate Development The maternal to zygotic transition is a fundamental transfer of information conserved among all animals and characterized by a profound change of the transcriptional landscape. Post-transcriptional regulation mediates this drastic change in gene expression through regulatory elements embedded in maternal mRNAs. RNA structure is detrimental to RNA function and regulatory element activity. Coordination of essential biological processes relies on specific RNA structures such as RNA G-quadruplexes-mediated translation in cancer. Therefore, this proposal will address two central questions in biology: what are the components of the code regulating early embryogenesis and what is the role and molecular function of individual components in vertebrate development. New approaches will be used to understand this vital transition. First, high throughput experiments will be performed to identify mRNA elements that regulate mRNA abundance and translation (Aim 1), and to solve their RNA structure (Aim 2). Then, a combination of biochemical and functional approaches will be used to discover the readers of those regulatory elements (Aim 3). Finally, mutants of those readers will be generated and their molecular mechanism and role studied during vertebrate development (Aim 3). Since the interaction between RNA structures and readers are master regulators of key biological phenomenon (e.g. GAIT system in inflammation and roquin in autoimmunity), the novel gene expression regulatory networks uncover in this proposal will likely be conserved in human and impact human development and health. To accomplish this proposal, Dr. Beaudoin will continue his training as Postdoctoral fellow in the Genetics Department at Yale University, where he will enjoy both state-of-the-art facilities and the interaction with his mentors and other scientific leaders in the field. With this K99 Award, Dr. Beaudoin's goals are to get close mentoring from several scientific experts (mentors and collaborators) in mRNA regulation, developmental biology, machine learning and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated functional screens. Furthermore, Dr. Beaudoin plans to expand his previous teaching and mentoring experience by participating in structured courses and workshops. This will allow him to learn innovative and effective ways to teach biology and progress to become a well- rounded scientist and mentor. Dr. Beaudoin existing expertise and the scientific and training plans of this proposal will allow him to reaching his long-term career goal: to establish a research program to understand the role of RNA structures and RNA helicases in vertebrate development. Defective RNA helicases have been associated to dozens of human diseases (e.g. infertility, neurological disorders, cancers and aging). Therefore, their molecular characterization in a relevant vertebrate model will provide invaluable insights to develop new human therapeutic approaches. Dr. Beaudoin is fully committed to obtain an appointment as a tenure track junior faculty in academia. It is fully expected that Dr. Beaudoin will be competitive for such group leader appointments at the completion of his K99/R00 Award tailored to enhance his scientific and mentoring skills. NARRATIVE  Every animal's life starts by a drastic and controlled remodeling of gene expression following the fertilization of the egg by the sperm. Interestingly, I have developed new tools to study the controllers mediating this essential transfer of information. The objective of this work is to discover all the regulators and the ways they interact one with each other to generate a fully-grown organism because it will ultimately help to understand human

"Specialized RNA analysis center for integrative genomic analyses ABSTRACT Projects like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) have generated a tremendous amount of data characterizing the genomic events in cancer and highlighting the deep complexity and significant heterogeneity that can make precision medicine challenging. Molecular subtyping has helped to identify groups of samples with shared genomic characteristics that can be used for clinical decisions. RNA expression has played a strong role in molecular subtyping over the last twenty years. Integration of RNA expression data with other data types that are being generated as part of the Genome Data Analysis Network have improved our knowledge of tumorigenesis and separating driving events from passenger events. Our team has over a 20 year history of innovation in expression technologies, innovating across generations of assays and projects. We propose to apply our knowledge, experience, and methods to address the projects that will be addressed in this cooperative agreement including clinical trial samples from ALCHEMIST or the Clinical Trials Sequencing Program. We propose to address four specific areas of research including `expression/mRNA analysis', `Spatial genomics data analysis', `data integration', and “clinical outcomes.” We will provide 1) analysis of RNA sequencing and expression data, 2) normalization and analysis methods of spatial transcriptomics data, 3) integrative genomic approaches for cancer classification and characterization, and 4) analysis of biomarkers for association with clinical and other molecular features. We will provide our data to other GDACs and work collaboratively with them to integrate our analyses and generate data for sharing with the larger scientific community through the Genome Data Commons. Project Narrative Large scale, multi-platform genomic projects in translational studies are often difficult to accomplish by individual laboratories. Collaborate team science networks, like The Cancer Genome Atlas and the Genome Data Analysis Network, bring together researchers with varied expertise to generate, analyze, and provide the data back to the research community for larger use and impact.

"miR-92a as a biomarker of diabetic retinopathy Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a global problem due to an alarming increase in the number of individuals with diabetes. The lack of an early diagnostic tool predicting retinal vascular health is a critical barrier to progress. To this end, we have identified circulating angiogenic cells (CACs) as ideal reporter cells, which are most receptive to changes of diabetic milieu and retinopathy. Our preliminary studies suggest that CACs map a distinct RNA signature. We also found that a miRNA, miR-92a, is downregulated explicitly in CACs with DR, and its overexpression in CACs of people with diabetes decreased pro-inflammatory markers, such as IL-1β and CD14, emphasizing the importance of CACs for biomarker discovery of retinal vascular health. Our preliminary studies using machine learning models could accurately predict DR providing us a stronger rationale for developing this paradigm for our robust study design. Furthermore, using rodent models, we found a decrease in miR-92a in lineage-Sca1+c-kit+ (LSK; mouse equivalent of CACs) parallels with an increase in acellular capillaries, and miR- 92a inhibition in LSKs triggered a stronger inflammatory response. Therefore, this proposal's overarching goal is to study RNA (miRNA and mRNA) and inflammatory signature using a robust sequencing paradigm and differential modeling in individuals with different severities of DR and animal models to gain insights into retinal vascular health. Our central hypothesis is that RNA signature in CACs mirror DR severity, and miR-92a decrease within CACs serves as a candidate biomarker. We propose the following specific aims to test our hypothesis: Aim 1: To assess changes in RNA levels in CACs of patients with different severity of DR and validate miR-92a as a candidate biomarker. Aim 2: Determine whether the miR-92a loss in bone marrow cells is associated with the development of DR in rodents. We anticipate that our proposed studies will identify specific mRNA and miRNA changes of DR severity and validate miR-92a as a novel biomarker for retinal vascular health. Overall, our studies will help improve the standard of care of DR individuals by aiding in diagnosis, prognosis and providing mechanistic insights for future therapies. While diabetic retinopathy (DR) cases are rising globally, and newer treatments are emerging, there is a lack of biomarkers reflecting retinal vascular health. We propose that the RNA levels (mRNA and miRNA) and inflammation in circulating angiogenic cells (CACs) will serve as a biomarker of DR. We will perform RNA sequencing of CACs in DR patients and study how a change in miRNA levels leads to retinopathy using rodent models.",miR-92a as a biomarker of diabetic

"AlgenML: Drug target discovery platform for transcriptional reprogramming of MYCN-driven neuroblastoma AlgenML: Drug target discovery platform for transcriptional reprogramming of MYCN-driven neuroblastoma PROJECT SUMMARY Drug discovery is a laborious, time-consuming, and expensive undertaking for biopharma. Oncology is especially difficult with new drugs in clinical trials having just 3.4% probability of success. This application addresses significant challenges of traditional drug target discovery in oncology that relies on cell viability or reporter assays which oversimplifies cell state. New advancements in single-cell RNA expression profiling allows us to overcome these challenges by quantitatively mapping transcriptional dependencies in cancer cells and rapidly probing vulnerabilities to reprogram the oncogenic signaling networks. Transcription factors MYCN and MYC are to date non-druggable by small molecules despite being high value cancer drug targets as they are frequently amplified genes and drive poor outcome across the cancer spectrum. Agents that block MYCN indirectly identified from synthetic lethal viability screens have resulted in only modest or short-lived responses in ongoing clinical trials. Algen’s proprietary machine learning platform (AlgenML) identifies targets that block oncogenic transcription addiction on MYCN using single-cell RNA expression of CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) gene knockdown. Genome-wide single-cell RNA expression profiling measures 10,000 genes per cell and each high- throughput assay routinely captures 160,000 cells at once. Using CRISPRi gene knockdown libraries and multiplexing the assays, hundreds of genes can be knocked down simultaneously and we single-cell RNA sequence 200 cells per CRISPRi gene knockdown. This makes for an extremely rich data set with over 400 million data points of RNA expression data which AlgenML analyzes. Our drug discovery approach is innovative because, unlike traditional approaches, the AlgenML platform does not identify essential genes that cause cell death, but rather selects drug targets in an unbiased manner whose suppression can reprogram the disease- related transcriptional dependencies. Resulting drugs should be safer and better tolerated. Here, our approach is to optimize AlgenML to monitor and reprogram MYCN transcriptional activity in new genetically defined models of MYCN-driven neuroblastoma. We focus on neuroblastoma because MYCN amplifications are common in the disease, and the genetically defined models allow detection of the precise contribution of MYCN oncogene compared to isogenic controls. In Aim 1, we define MYCN transcriptional signature, nominate target genes, and test target genes in vitro based on their ability to reprogram the MYCN transcriptional dependency. Aim 2 evaluates in vivo efficacy of target inhibition to shrink tumors and extend lifespan in new human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) and rodent models of neuroblastoma from UCSF. Our team of investigators at Algen and UCSF has decades of experience in developing RNA signatures to indirectly targeting MYC and MYCN via synthetic lethality. Mature startup Algen Biotechnologies has a vibrant ecosystem of investors, innovators, and grew out of Nobel Laureate Dr. Jennifer Doudna’s lab at UC Berkeley, who has been a scientific advisor since its founding. With Dr. William Weiss at UCSF, we have assembled a powerhouse environment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Algen is developing a drug discovery platform to select and test drug targets that block the oncogenic transcriptional effects of non-druggable drivers such as MYCN. MYC and MYCN transcription factors are directly non-druggable by small molecules, despite being high value targets for drug discovery because their amplifications correlate with extremely poor prognosis across the cancer spectrum. MYCN is amplified in 25% of all neuroblastoma, the most common extracranial solid tumor of childhood, and marks high-risk disease with an aggressive phenotype that is resistant to chemotherapy and only a 40-50% 5-year survival rate.",AlgenML: Drug target discovery platform for transcriptional reprogramming of MYCN-driven neuroblastoma,10326006,R41GM146327,"['Antineoplastic Agents ', ' Anti-Cancer Agents ', ' Antineoplastic Drugs ', ' Antineoplastics ', ' Cancer Drug ', ' Neoplastic Disease Chemotherapeutic Agents ', ' Tumor-Specific Treatment Agents ', ' anti-cancer drug ', ' anticancer agent ', ' anticancer drug ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cell Death ', ' necrocytosis ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environment ', ' Gene Amplification ', ' natural gene amplification ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Industrialization ', ' Libraries ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Methods ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neural Crest ', ' Neuroblastoma ', ' Oncogenes ', ' Cancer Genes ', ' Cancer-Promoting Gene ', ' Transforming Genes ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patents ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Probability ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Genetic Suppression ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' RNA Sequences ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Malignant -

"Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis ABSTRACT  Early detection of multiple sclerosis is key to limiting neurological damage but monitoring patient progression and response to therapy is of arguably similar if not greater importance due to the chronic nature of disease. Moreover, rates of non-adherence to therapy has been reported to be as high as 25% to 40% in the patient population suggesting the need to provide continuous monitoring and selection of optimal therapy. Identification of novel actionable biomarkers would provide clinicians with additional information for the purposes of diagnosis, prognosis, clinical subtyping as well as for the selection and monitoring of therapy. Initiation of sub-optimal therapy can be both detrimental to the patient’s health and financial well-being.  To date, the general approach to selecting a disease modifying treatment (DMT) is to weigh the risks and benefits while considering the aggressiveness of disease, efficacy of the drug and the potential side effects of treatment in a “trial and error” fashion. This approach is quite unsettling when understanding that treatment failure or inadequacy can cause irreversible neurological damage. Furthermore, many of these drugs are associated with serious adverse drug reactions such as cardiac events, opportunistic infections and secondary autoimmunity. Selection of the best therapy for a particular patient as well as the ability to identify if/when efficacy of a particular DMT dwindles is highly desirable and would be of great benefit throughout the healthcare spectrum. The course of MS disease does not manifest identically in all patients nor do all patients respond to treatment the same way. Identification of actionable biomarkers to serve as a surrogate for the efficacy of a particular therapy would allow clinicians to identify nonresponsive patients as early as possible and potentially evaluate dosing or administration to optimize patient outcomes.  Our previous work has explored lncRNAs as candidate biomarkers that can be measured in peripheral whole blood to accurately classify MS. The preliminary data provided in support of our fast track application highlights the potential for lncRNA expression levels analyzed with machine learning to not only classify MS but also indicate treatment responses. The emerging view by specialists that take care of patients with autoimmune diseases is that early diagnosis and early, aggressive and effective therapy is critical to produce the best long-term outcomes. This is very evident for multiple sclerosis with the goal of reducing damage to the central nervous system, producing longer and better disease remission, and mitigating long-term disability. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly discovered classes of RNAs with an array of regulatory functions. Our hypothesis to test is that classifiers can be built based upon differential expression of novel lncRNAs in blood. These classifiers will possess high levels of accuracy to monitor treatment responses in multiple sclerosis.",Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis,10124273,R44AI145505,"['Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune condition ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Autoimmunity ', ' Autoimmune Status ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cerebrospinal Fluid ', ' cerebral spinal fluid ', ' spinal fluid ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Europe ', ' Evoked Potentials ', ' Exhibits ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Invertebrates ', ' Invertebrata ', ' Laboratories ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Multiple Sclerosis ', ' Disseminated Sclerosis ', ' insular sclerosis ', ' Persons ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Opportunistic Infections ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Paper ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Probability ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Spinal Cord ', ' Medulla Spinalis ', ' Suggestion ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' United States ', ' Vertebrates ', ' Vertebrate Animals ', ' vertebrata ', ' Work ', ' Oligoclonal Bands ', ' Oligoclonal Immunoglobulins ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Specialist ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' therapy failure ', ' base ', ' Peripheral ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' disability ', ' Neurologist ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Nature ', ' Whole Blood ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Remission ', ' Disease remission ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' drug efficacy ', ' cohort ', ' ESTs ', ' Expressed Sequence Tags ', ' novel ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Nervous System Injuries ', ' Nervous System damage ', ' Neurological Damage ', ' Neurological Injury ', ' Neurological trauma ', ' neurotrauma ', ' Nervous System Trauma ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' response ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' disease control ', ' disorder control ', ' health organization ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Monitor ', ' Cardiac ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' human disease ', ' aggressive therapy ', ' aggressive treatment ', ' patient population ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' candidate marker ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' phase 2 study ', ' phase II study ', ' differential expression ', ' differentially expressed ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' multiple sclerosis patient ', ' MS patient ', ' patients with MS ', ' patients with multiple sclerosis ', ' brain health ', ' preservation ', ' optimal treatments ', ' optimal therapies ', ' experimental group ', ' clinical subtypes ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Treatment-related side effects ', ' adverse drug reaction ', ' learning classifier ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NIAID,"IQUITY LABS, INC",R44,2021,499995,TN-05
"Learning the Regulatory Code of Alzheimer's Disease Genomes Project Summary Alternative splicing is a key cellular process whose dysregulation has been implicated broadly across human genetic disease. Dr. Knowles previously developed LeafCutter, a flexible, scalable, annotation-free tool to quantify local patterns of RNA splicing from short-read RNA-seq data. While LeafCutter has been quite widely adopted and we have actively maintained it and addressed issues on github, it remains “early stage” software. We propose software engineering improvements: 1) appropriate packaging using conda with standard build, installation, testing and logging processes, 2) containerization using Docker, 3) standardization of input/output data formats/interfaces, and 4) refactoring to use a standard workflow language. These improvements will allow us to distribute LeafCutter through repositories including PyPI, BioConda, DockStore, and Galaxy. Finally improvements to documentation, testing and version management will make contributions to LeafCutter from the open source community more feasible and easier to integrate. The parent award for the proposed work is U01 AG068880-01 “Learning the Regulatory Code of Alzheimer's Disease Genomes”, where we are developing state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) models to better understand the genetic basis of AD. This award makes extensive use of LeafCutter. In Aim 1 we are building DL models of pre- and post- transcriptional regulation: for the latter LeafCutter provides training data for our neural network model of the sequence determinants of RNA splicing in AD-relevant cell types and states. In Aim 2 we connect AD-associated structural variation to functional variation, including RNA splicing variation. In Aim 3, we will build trans-expression QTL networks across thousands of post-mortem brain samples: with the improvements to the LeafCutter ecosystem proposed here we will be able to straightforwardly extend to trans splicing QTL networks. While we and our collaborators are ourselves heavy users of LeafCutter, we will continue to ensure we provide for the needs and use-cases of the broader genomics community. Alternative splicing is an important cellular process where “junk” DNA is removed from the gene before it is translated into protein. When this process is disrupted in some way it can cause disease. Here we propose software engineering improvements to software, LeafCutter, we previously developed to better understand splicing patterns from RNA-seq data.",Learning the Regulatory Code of

"Genomics-based approaches to understanding mechanistic alterations of spliceosome function in disease states Splicing factors are frequently altered by mutations and copy-number changes both in cancer and in germline genetic diseases resulting in multi-system developmental syndromes. Despite the fact that virtually all genes in humans undergo splicing, spliceosomal genetic alterations tend to exhibit surprisingly specific effects on subsets of splicing events, leaving most insignificantly changed. These effects can be allele-specific, cell-type specific, and dependent on the genetic background of the afflicted cell. This makes it especially challenging to determine which affected splicing events contribute to disease etiology. The fact that a limited set of introns is responsive to any specific splicing factor alteration indicates that introns and their flanking exons have evolved in structure and sequence to confer differential sensitivity to the action of different spliceosome components. This raises a fundamental question: what are the features common to sets of introns that confer this specificity? Using naturally occurring splicing gene mutations, amplifications, and deletions, these perturbations will be modelled in a genetically stable, untransformed, isogenic cell system where it is possible to isolate the effect of a single alteration on the transcriptome and on the binding patterns of the altered protein. These studies will shed light on the mechanisms of normal spliceosome function, and provide insight into which genes and biological pathways affected by splicing dysfunction likely contribute to disease states.  The proposed experiments will employ three distinct methods to model spliceosome perturbations associated with human disease, with a focus on factors that physically or functionally interact with the essential spliceosome protein SF3B1. (Specific Aim 1) Introduction of an allelic series of cancer-associated SF3B1 missense-mutations into isogenic cell lines using recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE); (Specific Aim 2) CRISPRa/i-mediated activation or inhibition of transcription to up- or down- regulate splicing factors that are amplified in cancers (PUF60, SF3B4, and U2AF2) and lost in developmental syndromes (PUF60, SF3B4); and (Specific Aim 3) rapid depletion of spliceosomal RNA helicases (DDX39B, DDX46, and DHX16) and their putative co-factors (SUGP1, RBM17, and GPKOW) at the protein level using auxin-inducible degrons. Three distinct methods of RNA sequencing will be used to quantify the changes resulting from these perturbations: poly(A)-selected RNAseq, allele-specific eCLIP, and a novel intron lariat capture sequencing approach. Lastly, we will integrate these genomic data sets into models using deep learning neural networks to interrogate our central hypothesis: the sequence and structure of individual mammalian introns have evolved to confer differential dependence on specific ‘core’ components of the spliceosome, and that mutations, amplifications, and deletions in these core components causal for human disease will uncover intron-centric gene expression regulatory circuits that are controlled though modulation of the abundance or activity of the associated splicing factors in normal cells. PROJECT NARRATIVE The essential spliceosome protein SF3B1 functions as a hub to coordinate the positioning and dynamic rearrangements of numerous RNA and protein splicing factors. SF3B1, as well as many of its interacting cofactors, are frequently mutated, amplified, or deleted in cancers and in developmental syndromes, yet rather than affecting all introns equally, these disease-associated alterations in the core of the spliceosome have different and specific effects on subsets of introns. Understanding the intronic codes that confer sensitivity to these naturally occurring genetic changes will provide insight into the mechanisms of spliceosome function as well as the biological pathways distorted by spliceosome dysfunction that may present new therapeutic vulnerabilities.",Genomics-based approaches to understanding mechanistic alterations of spliceosome function in disease states,10183903,R01GM141544,"['recombinase ', ' RNA Helicase ', ' Mediating ', ' Spliceosomes ', ' base ', ' cofactor ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Protein Splicing ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Dependence ', ' Event ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Gene Alteration ', ' Gene Mutation ', ' mutant ', ' Missense Mutation ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Splice Acceptor Sites ', "" 3' Splice Site "", ' Genomics ', ' DNA Helicases ', ' DNA Unwinding Proteins ', ' DNA unwinding enzyme ', ' helicase ', ' RNA bound ', ' RNA Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Normal Cell ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' patched protein ', ' copy number variant ', ' copy number variation ', ' Copy Number Polymorphism ', ' Data ', ' Deletion Mutation ', ' Motor ', ' Mutate ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' virtual ', ' Outcome ', ' human disease ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' tumor ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' recombinase-mediated cassette exchange ', ' Cre Lox technology ', ' Cre LoxP system ', ' Cre lox recombination system ', ' Cre lox system ', ' Cre recombinase/LoxP technology ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' recruit ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' genetic condition ', ' genetic disorder ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' causal variant ', ' causal allele ', ' causal gene ', ' causal mutation ', ' causative mutation ', ' causative variant ', ' gene expression variation ', ' Affect ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Epitopes ', ' Antigenic Determinants ', ' Binding Determinants ', ' Auxins ', ' Biology ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Catalysis ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Exhibits ', ' Exons ', ' Gene Amplification ', ' natural gene amplification ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Spliced Genes ', ' Gene Splicing ', ' Genetic Screening ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Introns ', ' Intervening Sequences ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Poly A ', ' Poly(rA) ', ' polyadenylate ', ' Proteins ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Splicing ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Specificity ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2021,323400,NY-25
"Developing Machine Learning Models for the Analysis of Splicing Data in Large Heterogeneous Cohorts Abstract Analysis of RNA sequencing (RNASeq) data obtained from large patient cohorts can reveal transcriptomic perturbations that are associated with complex disease and facilitate the identification of disease subtypes. This is typically framed as an unsupervised learning task to discover latent structure in a matrix of RNASeq based quantification of gene expression or local splicing variations (LSVs). However, several factors make analysis of such heterogeneous data challenging. First, such datasets are comprised of samples processed at multiple institutions which might employ different sequencing protocols and quality control steps. This introduces confounding factors into the data like inconsistent sample quality or variable cell type proportions which can hinder detection of true biological signal. Second, in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), mutations in splice factor genes occurring in a subset of the patients may only result in alteration of a subset of coregulated splicing events. Thus, instead of measuring global similarity between samples based on all transcriptomic features, there is a need to efficiently identify “tiles”, defined by a subset of samples and splicing events with abnormal signals. Although several algorithms have been proposed for this task, they fail to overcome many of the computational challenges associated with modeling splicing data and are not well suited to handle missing values. To facilitate analysis of heterogeneous splicing datasets by reducing false positive discoveries and boosting true biological signal, we will first develop a model to correct for the effects of RNA degradation and cell type mixtures. Then in order to efficiently identify AML subtypes characterized by splicing events and account for splicing specific modeling challenges, we propose CHESSBOARD (Characterizing Heterogeneity of Expression and Splicing by Search for Blocks of Abnormalities and Outliers in RNA Datasets), a non- parametric Bayesian model for unsupervised discovery of tiles. We will apply our models to synthetic datasets and show it outperforms several baseline approaches. Next, we will show that it recovers tiles characterized by known and novel splicing aberrations which are reproducible in multiple AML patient cohorts. Finally, we will show that tiles discovered are correlated with drug response to therapeutics, pointing to the translational impact of our findings. Project Narrative: Analysis of RNA-Seq data from large patient cohorts can reveal novel biological signatures that are pivotal to advancing precision medicine, especially for the treatment of heterogeneous hematologic malignancies.

"Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome Detecting protein-RNA interactions is challenging–both experimentally and computationally– because RNA transcripts are large in number, diverse in cellular location and function. As a result, many RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and their cognate motifs are likely unknown or uncharacterized in humans as well as other model organisms. With increasing number of RBPs implicated in human diseases, there is an urgent need for identifying and mapping functional and phenotypic information for RBPs as well as to complete a map of the protein-RNA interaction network. The objective here is to establish a robust computational technique that integrates expression associations with sequence as well as several RBP centric features for genome-scale prediction of binding motifs for hundreds of human RBPs to facilitate the elucidation of their tissue-specific post-transcriptional networks. At the completion of this project, we expect to have developed the most advanced tool for predicting human RBP motifs and methods as well as resources which can facilitate the construction of tissue-specific RBP-RNA networks. Our central hypothesis, supported by our initial genome-scale computational study and assessment by comparative analysis of known RBP binding motifs is that, since many RBPs are involved in different stages of RNA metabolism, exon expression level associations with an RBP and other exon related features can be very powerful in identifying the binding motifs of an RBP in a tissue-specific manner. The proposed integrated approach to experimentally validate several binding motifs using CLIP-seq and to deconvolute global posttranscriptional networks in specific cell/tissue types, using genome-wide data from protein protection assays (POP-seq) will significantly enhance our capability of uncovering network dynamics of RBPs in cell types and tissues. Such high-quality predictions based on experimental validations, resulting from all the Aims which will be made public, can become a venue for future experimental follow up to dissect the role of these important regulatory molecules in different tissues and disease states. The proposed studies will make an impact in the field as the first large-scale computational mapping of protein-RNA interaction networks in the human tissues by taking our ability to predict RBP targets to the next level. The complementary experience and expertise of investigators will make this project successful. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play important roles in every biological pathway and cellular process. Elucidation of the RNA recognition motifs of hundreds of RNA-binding proteins discovered in recent years and analysis of dynamic post-transcriptional networks of RBPs across various tissues and disease states will increase our fundamental knowledge about how gene expression is modulated by these important regulatory molecules in living organisms. This knowledge is a critical step towards understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of several human diseases caused by mutation or mis-expression of these proteins.",Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome,10249195,R01GM123314,"['Algorithms ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Exons ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mining ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Ribonucleoproteins ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA-Binding Proteins ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' insight ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' human tissue ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' K562 Cells ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' RNA bound ', ' RNA Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' protein expression ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Protein Binding Motif ', ' Protein-Protein Interaction Domain ', ' Protein Binding Domain ', ' RNA-Protein Interaction ', ' Computational Technique ', ' K-562 ', ' K562 ', ' K562 blasts ', ' Transcript ', ' Validation ', ' RNA Recognition Motif ', ' Putative RNA-Binding Region ', ' RNA Binding Domain ', ' RNP Domain ', ' RNP Motif ', ' RNP-1 Signature ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' deep sequencing ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' computer studies ', ' computational studies ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' user-friendly ', ' human disease ', ' comparative ', ' disease-causing mutation ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' MALAT1 gene ', ' MALAT1 ', ' metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 ', ' differential expression ', ' differentially expressed ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' HepG2 ', ' Hep G2 ', ' HepG2 cell line ', ' crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing ', ' CLIP-Seq ', ' HITS-CLIP ', ' High-throughput sequencing of CLIP cDNA library ', ' predictive tools ', ' online resource ', ' internet resource ', ' on-line compendium ', ' on-line resource ', ' online compendium ', ' web resource ', ' web-based resource ', ' bioinformatics tool ', ' bio-informatics tool ', ' RNA metabolism ', ' ']",NIGMS,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2021,302431,IN-07
"Platform for transcriptome-wide RNA modification identification in long reads Project Summary RNA modifications are pervasive throughout the human transcriptome and affect transcript stability, localization, and function. In particular, ADAR-mediated adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) edits in RNA have been shown to affect pre-mRNA splicing and alter codon sequence. Amino acid changes caused by inosines have been implicated in various deleterious conditions, which include cancer and diseases of the brain. However, previous literature mapping inosine positions in high-throughput were only able to do so inside the limited context provided by short RNA-Seq reads. As modifications can be transcript-specific, elucidating the association of inosines with full mRNA isoforms is crucial for a more rigorous understanding of the role of inosine modifications in the tissues of our body and, more broadly, disease. Therefore, I propose to investiate A-to-I editing in the context of diseased and non-diseased systems using full-length mRNA nanopore sequencing. The nanopore is able to sequence whole RNA strands by converting changes in electrical current caused by RNA translocating through the pore into nucleotide sequence. ​Aim 1 leverages high-accuracy nanopore cDNA sequencing of cellular systems with and without ADAR knockdown to interrogate ADAR function and A-to-I-induced changes to transcript expression changes. To accomplish the latter, I will develop workflows to determine isoform structure from noisy, long reads. In addition to sequencing full-length transcripts, nanopore native RNA (nvRNA) sequencing informs on RNA modifications, as modified nucleotides appear as subtle alteration in current signal with respect to canonical nucleotides. As such, ​Aim 2 ​employs a generalizable approach to producing cost-effective training data for systematically understanding how inosines alter current signals in nanopores. I will use a Cas13b-ADAR fusion protein (REPAIRv2) to create site-specific edits and then perform nvRNA sequencing on the edited transcriptome. Site-specific A-to-I editing allows this approach to create a labelled inosine dataset in nvRNA signal from which I can develop computational algorithms to reliably identify inosines in nvRNA data. The REPAIRv2 approach to can be generalized to eventually identify any RNA modification with nanopores. ​Aim 3 will elucidate how A-to-I editing differs between tissues. I will sequence 4 normal tissue types with nvRNA sequencing, generating a map of A-to-I edits in conjunction with isoform usage using the software I am developing. Taken together, the fulfillment of these aims will not only provide further insights on elusive ADAR mechanism, but also create workflows for nanopore data analysis and a platform for the study of any modification. As I work toward my Ph.D. with this interdisciplinary project, I will gain invaluable skills in experimental and computational biology that will prepare me for a career in science. Project Narrative Understanding the functional outcomes of adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing in greater depth is crucial to understanding cancer, diseases of the brain, and other deleterious effects that arise from modification misregulation. To study inosines in full-length mRNA contexts, we will use nanopore sequencing to generate a map of A-to-I editing in diseased and non-diseased transcriptomes. The objective of this proposal is to develop the experimental and computational requisites for identifying inosine modifications in nanopore native RNA sequencing data, particularly for illuminating the interplay between A-to-I editing, alternative splicing, and mRNA regulation.",Platform for transcriptome-wide RNA modification identification in long reads,10168450,F31HG010999,"['Adenosine ', ' adenosine deaminase ', ' Adenosine Aminohydrolase ', ' Affect ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Atlases ', ' Base Sequence ', ' Nucleotide Sequence ', ' nucleic acid sequence ', ' Biology ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Breast ', ' Complementary DNA ', ' cDNA ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Codon Nucleotides ', ' Codon ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Exons ', ' Guanosine ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Inosine ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Motor Neurons ', ' Motor Cell ', ' motoneuron ', ' mRNA Precursor ', ' Pre-mRNA ', ' RNA, Messenger, Precursors ', ' premRNA ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Permeability ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Splicing ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Lung Adenocarcinoma ', ' Chimeric Proteins ', ' Chimera Protein ', ' Fusion Protein ', ' RNA Editing ', ' RNA, Messenger, Editing ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Label ', ' Site ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Poly(A) Tail ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Normal Tissue ', ' Normal tissue morphology ', ' tool ', ' computer biology ', ' Computational Biology ', ' human tissue ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Isoforms ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' success ', ' nerve cell death ', ' nerve cell loss ', ' neuron cell death ', ' neuron cell loss ', ' neuron death ', ' neuronal cell death ', ' neuronal cell loss ', ' neuronal death ', ' neuronal loss ', ' neuron loss ', ' RT-PCR ', ' RTPCR ', ' reverse transcriptase PCR ', ' Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' RNA Polyadenylation ', ' Polyadenylation ', ' RNA Processing ', ' Polymerase ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Transcript ', ' Characteristics ', ' Modification ', ' cost ', ' knock-down ', ' knockdown ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' functional outcomes ', ' nanopore ', ' nano pore ', ' cost effective ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,F31,2021,38613,CA-20
"Pre-mRNA intronic structures in trans factor binding and alternative splicing Project Summary Splicing is the process of removing intronic regions from a precursor messenger RNA (mRNA) and combining exons into a mature transcript. Alternative splicing results in differential intron removal, producing multiple alternatively spliced isoforms arising from a common precursor mRNA. The dysregulation of splicing is estimated to underlie at least 15% of human diseases, and is likely to contribute to many more. Splice reactions are performed by the spliceosome, an RNA protein complex that is assembled onto precursor mRNA in stages. The final activity of the spliceosome is influenced by a combination of trans-acting spliceosome factors and cis elements within the precursor mRNA. However, factors involved in cis element function, like sequence motifs and RNA structure folds, are not fully understood, and a majority of such elements remain unidentified. This is particularly true for branchpoint selection, an essential early stage of spliceosome assembly within the intron around the catalytic adenosine. Although the branchpoint is loosely recognized as a highly degenerate sequence motif, it influences downstream splice site selection. My first goal is to elucidate the impact of RNA structure on branchpoint selection by focusing on RNA structure-mediated binding by the spliceosome associated SF3B complex. To do so, I will develop RNA secondary structure models for SF3B-dependent precursor RNAs to identify enriched structural motifs. My work will entail the first large-scale derivation of intronic secondary structures, including branchpoint regions, which will aid in better understanding of how RNA structures around cis regulatory elements influence splicing. My second goal is to develop a system to identify cis splicing regulatory elements and rapidly test their functional significance. To identify regulatory elements, I will identify cis features on mRNAs, including protein binding sites, conservation and RNA secondary structure, and use machine learning to discover novel signatures of functionally relevant cis regulatory regions. The functional impact of such sites on alternative splicing will be experimentally tested through use of antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) that can block or inhibit the regulatory region. I will set up a positive feedback loop where I can predict cis splice regulatory elements and immediately test their impact on splicing with ASOs, incorporating the test results back into the model to improve predictions. This system will lead to accurate prediction of cis regulatory splicing elements within any gene of interest. Accurate identification of cis elements will improve our ability to understand co-regulation of alternative splicing. The long-term vision of my research is to demystify the splicing code by clarifying the role of RNA structure in splicing and developing a powerful system to identify functional cis regulatory splicing elements and test their activity. Project Narrative Splicing is the process by which introns are removed from precursor mRNA to generate productive transcripts but, if performed incorrectly, can lead to aberrant transcripts and many human diseases. The goal of this project is to understand how RNA structure influences recognition of regulatory elements. Ultimately this research strives to identify elements within precursor mRNAs that regulate splicing and develop tools that can modulate splicing in a predictable manner, revealing more about the role of RNA splicing in disease and leading to therapeutics for splicing-related disorders.",Pre-mRNA intronic structures in trans factor binding and alternative splicing,10275711,R35GM142851,"['Adenosine ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Exons ', ' Feedback ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Introns ', ' Intervening Sequences ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Structural Models ', ' mRNA Precursor ', ' Pre-mRNA ', ' RNA, Messenger, Precursors ', ' premRNA ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Research ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Precursors ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Splicing ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' Antisense Oligonucleotides ', ' Anti-Sense Oligonucleotides ', ' Antisense Agent ', ' anti-sense agent ', ' anti-sense oligo ', ' antisense oligo ', ' Mediating ', ' Spliceosomes ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Protein Binding ', ' bound protein ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Reaction ', ' System ', ' Test Result ', ' interest ', ' Isoforms ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Spliceosome Assembly ', ' Spliceosome Assembly Pathway ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' protein complex ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Transcript ', ' Process ', ' Derivation procedure ', ' Derivation ', ' human disease ', ' ']",NIGMS,CLEMSON UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,366211,SC-03
