"Uncovering the Human Secretome PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Peptide hormones regulate embryonic development and most physiological processes by acting as endocrine or paracrine signals. They are also a rich source of relatively safe medicines to treat both common and rare diseases. Yet finding peptide-coding genes below ~300 base pairs is inherently difficult because they lie within the noise of the genome. Recent multidisciplinary, proteophylogenomic studies in lower species, such as yeast and flies, have uncovered hundreds of new small protein-coding genes called “smORFs”. In humans, recent work on the mitochondrial genome has also uncovered dozens of small peptide hormone genes called MDPs. Based on these and other studies, it is estimated that about 5% of proteins in the human nuclear genome have not yet been discovered, particularly those that encode small peptides below 100 amino acids. It is a well documented but rarely challenged practice to discard large quantities of sequencing and proteomic data because they do not match the annotated human genome. My overarching goal is to discover the human “secretome” and make practical use of it to improve the human condition. Over the past few years, we have developed a unique pipeline of technologies that combines breakthroughs in math, computer hardware and software, proteomics, mass spectrometry, and HTS screening, each of which has been optimized and integrated. Our GeneFinder software modules, based on machine-learning, can process data 100 times faster than traditional methods and rapidly validate small human genes using public and in-house generated databases of genetic and proteomic data. Using the prototype version of the platform that finds conservation between humans, chimp, and macaque, we have discovered thousands of putative peptide-coding genes and validated hundreds of them. We aim to (1) further improve the algorithm to increase its speed and accuracy, (2) improve the genome annotation for thousands of small novel genes, (3) determine their expression profiles in normal and diseased tissues, (4) explore their genetic association with disease loci, and (5) screen the first secretomic library to find hormones with novel biological and therapeutically relevant activities. The data, the software package, and libraries will be made available to the research community. In doing so, we will shed light on the dark matter of the human genome, the parts with the greatest therapeutic potential, thereby helping to steer and accelerate the pace of research and drug development for generations to come. PROJECT NARRATIVE There has been a rapid expansion in the use of peptide hormones as drugs over the last decade, yet new research indicates that more than 90% of all hormones in the body (encoded by an additional 5% of the human genome) remain to be discovered. As a result, terabytes of data are discarded each week and innumerable opportunities for biological discovery are missed because, according to our findings, the majority of genes below ~300 base pairs are missing from the annotated human genome. We propose an integrated, multi- disciplinary approach to find, validate and characterize an estimated 4000-5000 new peptide-coding genes using a pioneering technology platform that combines breakthroughs in math, custom-built computer hardware and software, and wet-lab approaches, providing a far more complete roadmap for biology and medicine in the 21st century.",Uncovering the Human Secretome,10223179,DP1AG058605,"['Algorithms ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Biological Response Modifier Therapy ', ' Biologic Therapy ', ' Biological Therapy ', ' biological therapeutic ', ' biological treatment ', ' biotherapeutics ', ' biotherapy ', ' Biology ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Hardware ', ' computer system hardware ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Goals ', ' Hormones ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Libraries ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Macaca ', ' Macaque ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Noise ', ' Peptides ', ' Physiological Processes ', ' Organism-Level Process ', ' Organismal Process ', ' Physiologic Processes ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Yeasts ', ' Generations ', ' Pan Genus ', ' Chimp ', ' Chimpanzee ', ' Pan Species ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Therapeutic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Source ', ' Endocrine ', ' Nuclear ', ' Paracrine Signaling ', ' Paracrine Communication ', ' Peptide Hormone Gene ', ' peptide hormone ', ' Base Pairing ', ' Orphan Disease ', ' Rare Disorder ', ' orphan disorder ', ' Rare Diseases ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' drug development ', ' Genetic Data Banks ', ' Genetic Data Bases ', ' Genetic Databanks ', ' Genetic Information Databases ', ' Genetic Databases ', ' Proteomics ', ' genetic association ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' fly ', ' Flies ', ' mitochondrial genome ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' prototype ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' genome annotation ', ' screening ', ' dark matter ', ' terabyte ', ' ']",NIA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,DP1,2021,1186500,MA-07
"Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful technique that enables label-free spatial mapping of different classes of biomolecules in biological systems. Because it does not require any special sample pretreatment, ambient MSI is particularly attractive for high throughput automated imaging applications. The throughput of ambient MSI experiments is typically limited by the inherently slow microprobe-type sampling from surfaces, which is a characteristic shortcoming of many chemical imaging modalities. This project will combine several highly innovative approaches to address challenges associated with the high-throughput high- resolution ambient MSI of lipids and metabolites using nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano-DESI). Nano-DESI is an ambient ionization technique, which relies on gentle localized liquid extraction of molecules from tissue sections into a flowing solvent confined between two glass capillaries. The extracted molecules are efficiently delivered to a mass spectrometer inlet and ionized by soft electrospray ionization. Nano-DESI MSI enables detection of hundreds of metabolites, lipids, and peptides in tissue sections with high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, and without special sample pretreatment. Furthermore, on-the-fly quantification of lipids and metabolites in tissue sections during nano-DESI imaging experiments is achieved by doping the working solvent with appropriate standards of known concentration. This project will extend these powerful capabilities of nano-DESI MSI to enable high-throughput imaging of large tissue sections of interest to the HubMAP Consortium. This will be achieved using a combination of a conceptually different nano-DESI probe design optimized for robustness, ease of fabrication, and spatial resolution and a suite of advanced machine learning and compressed sensing computational approaches. These developments will be applicable to different types of human tissues and will transform quantitative molecular imaging of multiple classes of biomolecules in tissue sections. Although the capabilities of the new imaging platform will be demonstrated using non-diseased tissue, these developments will be broadly applicable to scientific problems associated with understanding health and disease Project Narrative This research is focused on the development of a transformative technology for rapid, quantitative, and robust imaging of different classes of biomolecules in human tissues using mass spectrometry.

"Compute-Cluster for Deep-Learning Models for Mass Spectrometry based Proteomics data Project Abstract/Summary Mass spectrometry (MS) data is high-dimensional data that is used for large-scale system biology proteomics. The current state of the art mass spectrometers can generate thousands of spectra from a single organism and experiment. This high-dimensional data is processed using database searches and denovo algorithms with varying degrees of success. The overarching objective of this study is to develop, test, integrate and evaluate novel image-processing and deep-learning algorithms that will allow us to deduce and identify reliable peptide sequences in a definitive and quantitative fashion. Our long-term goal is to improve on identification of MS based proteomics data using novel and scalable algorithms. The objective of this proposal is to investigate, design and implement machine-learning deep-learning algorithms for identification of peptides from MS data. Since deep-learning is very good at discovering intricate structures in high-dimensional data it will be ideal solution for discovering dark proteomics data and more accurate deduction of peptides. We predict that the integration of these methods, along with traditional numerical algorithms, will lead to a multimodal fusion-based approach for an optimized and accurate peptide deduction system for large-scale MS data. Further, we will design and implement data augmentation, memory-efficient indexing, and high-performance computing (HPC) to achieve these outcomes more efficiently with a shorter computational time. Therefore, this new line of investigation is significant since it has the potential to improve on long-stalled effort to increase accuracy, reliability and reproducibility of MS data analysis and search tools. The proximate expected outcome of this work is a novel set of deep-learning and image-processing tools which will allow much better insight in MS based proteomics data. The results will have an important positive impact immediately because these proposed research tasks will lay the groundwork to develop a new class of algorithms and will provide rapid, high-throughput, sensitive, and reproducible and reliable tools for MS based proteomics. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding Mass Spectrometry (MS) based proteomics can allow systematic analysis of thousands of proteins with the promise of discovering new protein biomarkers for different disease conditions and better understanding of human systems biology. Because of high-dimensionality of the big data generated from MS machines efficient, accurate and reproducible tools are required to mine and analyze the data and is the subject of this proposal. Such high-performance tools will be instrumental in elucidating the microbiome which affects virtually all aspects of human health.

"Molecular Imaging and Diagnosis of Endometriosis using Mass Spectrometry Technologies ABSTRACT: Endometriosis is a chronic pathologic condition that affects approximately 176 million worldwide, and can cause severe abdominal pain and subfertility. Despite its prevalence, there is currently no widely accepted theory of pathogenesis for endometriosis. Further, there are currently no clinical biomarkers for non- invasive diagnosis as most patients are only diagnosed at the time of exploratory laparoscopy. Thus, application of new molecular technologies to advance the understanding, diagnosis, and intraoperative detection of endometriosis is critically needed to improve patient care and management. Ambient mass spectrometry (MS) techniques offer the chemical specificity and sensitivity to perform rapid and in-depth molecular analysis of unprocessed tissue samples. We propose to conduct a rigorous study applying MS techniques in conjunction with statistical methods to identify, characterize, and validate metabolic and protein markers of endometrial and endometriosis tissues correlated to patient symptoms and disease presentation. Further, we propose to evaluate the performance of ambient MS techniques as tools for rapid diagnosis of endometrial tissues, and in vivo intraoperative disease detection. Combining our team’s expertise in MS, statistics, gynecological surgery, pathology and endometriosis, we are unique poised to successfully carry out the following proposed aims: Aim 1. Characterize metabolic and proteomic markers of endometriosis tissues from endometriosis patients using MS imaging. Characterization of molecular markers that are specific to endometriosis lesions within tissue microenvironment can lead to new understanding of the biological mechanisms governing endometriosis development and pinpoint potential targets for treatment. Using a large cohort of tissues prospectively collected from surgeries, we will use MS imaging and statistical analysis to identify molecular signatures of endometriosis tissues and uncover significant molecular alterations correlated to patient phenotypes and disease presentation within controlled patient subgroups. Aim 2. Define diagnostic markers of endometriosis using endometrial tissues from endometriosis and unaffected patients. New methods for accurate and rapid diagnosis endometriosis are critically needed to advance patient care. We propose to use MS imaging and statistical analyses to identify diagnostic markers of endometriosis using endometrial tissue samples obtained from eutopic endometrium of endometriosis patients, and endometrium tissues from unaffected patients undergoing other benign gynecological procedures, with the goal of identifying molecular markers that could use for diagnosis of endometriosis from tissue biopsies. Aim 3. Test the MasSpec Pen as an intraoperative tool for in vivo endometriosis detection. Complete excision of endometriosis lesions and preservation of healthy adjacent tissues is of utmost importance in the surgical treatment of patients. We propose to conduct a clinical study to evaluate the performance of MasSpec Pen technology for in vivo detection of endometriosis lesions and surgical guidance in laparoscopic procedures. Narrative  We propose to develop and use mass spectrometry technologies in conjunction with statistical methods to better understand, detect, and diagnose endometriosis. By leveraging the advantages of the chemical sensitivity and specificity of mass spectrometry with the simplicity, speed, and spatial correlation offered by ambient mass spectrometry techniques, we aim to develop new methods that can improve the diagnosis and management of endometriosis at multiple stages of patient treatment using a large cohort of patient samples. The experiments proposed will explore the molecular differences between eutopic and ectopic endometrium tissues, correlate molecular data with patient phenotypes and disease presentation, advance development of a diagnostic method for endometriosis, and improve the surgical resection of endometriosis lesions in vivo during surgical procedures, leading to new understanding of this disease and offering improved treatment options for patients.",Molecular Imaging and Diagnosis of Endometriosis using Mass Spectrometry Technologies,10219741,R01HD101560,"['Abdominal Pain ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Biopsy ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' endometriosis ', ' Endometrium ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Pathology ', ' Patient Care Management ', ' Patients ', ' Laparoscopy ', ' Celioscopy ', ' Diagnostic Laparoscopy ', ' Peritoneoscopy ', ' Phenotype ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Robotics ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Specificity ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' statistics ', ' Gynecologic Surgical Procedures ', ' Gynecologic Surgery ', ' Gynecological Surgery ', ' Gynecological Surgical Procedure ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Benign ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Endometrial ', ' insight ', ' noninvasive diagnosis ', ' non-invasive diagnosis ', ' non-invasive diagnostic ', ' noninvasive diagnostic ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Metabolic ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' In Situ ', ' Techniques ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' ESI Mass Spectrometry ', ' Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization ', ' ionization ', ' Performance ', ' rapid diagnosis ', ' cohort ', ' Speed ', ' expectation ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Devices ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Reporting ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' reproductive ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Proteomics ', ' rapid method ', ' rapid technique ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Metabolic Marker ', ' Molecular Analysis ', ' Molecular Diagnosis ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' molecular profile ', ' molecular signature ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' in vivo ', ' Electrospray Ionization ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' molecular imaging ', ' molecule imaging ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' Advanced Development ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' minimally invasive ', ' treatment strategy ', ' molecular marker ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' eutopic endometrium ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' diagnostic biomarker ', ' diagnostic marker ', ' clinical biomarkers ', ' clinically useful biomarkers ', ' specific biomarkers ', ' protein biomarkers ', ' protein markers ', ' Tissue imaging ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' predictive signature ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' in situ imaging ', ' preservation ', ' subfertility ', ' primary infertility ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' ']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2021,1,TX-10

"A peptide-based point-of-care vertical flow assay for the rapid diagnosis of Lyme disease Abstract Project Summary There is an obvious need for new approaches and better assays for the laboratory diagnosis of Lyme disease. All attempts to develop a practical assay for the direct detection of Borrelia burgdorferi in infected patients have failed. Thus far, all proposed alternatives to serology have been unsuccessful, not cost-effective, or are still in early development. Improving serological detection in early disease is the fastest and most effective way to improve patient outcomes in Lyme disease. The antigen targets utilized in current serodiagnostic assays have considerable defects. They often contain conserved epitopes that cross-react with antibodies raised to other antigens, reducing specificity and requiring the use of a two-tier seroassay paradigm that preserves specificity at the cost of poor sensitivity in the detection of early disease. The use of peptides as serodiagnostic targets demonstrate improved efficacy, but the use of one or two peptides containing single epitopes still provides re- duced sensitivity in early disease. Putting the same old antigen targets into new platforms, no matter how in- novative the platform, will not succeed in improving serodiagnostics for Lyme disease. Both the target anti- gens and assays need an innovative approach. By incorporating unique peptides containing linear epitopes highly specific to B. burgdorferi, into a cutting-edge, multiplex, portable paper-based point-of-care diagnostic assay that uses a cost-effective smartphone-based reader, we aim to transform the diagnosis of Lyme disease. An ideal test for Lyme disease could be performed in a single step and yield an answer on the spot to support diagnosis and direct the course of clinical treatment. We have developed an innovative vertical-flow assay which allows for the multiplexed detection of IgM and IgG binding of up to 25 independent antigen targets in a point-of-care setting. The VFA design allows for uniform flow of sample across the target membrane, creating uniform binding conditions and maximizing developed signal. We coupled this design with a cost-effective portable smart-phone based reader allowing for quantitative measure of antibody binding, eliminating subjectiv- ity. By multiplexing peptide antigens each containing 1-2 epitopes unique to B. burgdorferi from multiple differ- ent antigens expressed at different stages during mammalian infection we can generate a single tier, POC as- say that can specifically and sensitively detect patient antibody at all stages of the disease. The assay can be completed in less than 25 min allowing for rapid in office results to support clinical diagnosis, thereby improving patient outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Early diagnosis of Lyme disease is critical to prevent disease progression and sequelae; however current laboratory diagnostics that are used to support clinical diagnosis are insensitive during early infection, failing ~50% of the time. We propose the development of a sensitive and specific multi-antigen point-of-care assay that will provide immediate serological detection of antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, to aid in physician diagnosis. Accurate, rapid diagnosis will improve patient outcomes by reducing the likelihood of developing potentially debilitating late stage disease through early antibiotic intervention.",A peptide-based point-of-care vertical flow assay for the rapid diagnosis of Lyme disease,10404209,R44AI150060,"['Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antibodies ', ' Epitopes ', ' Antigenic Determinants ', ' Binding Determinants ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' Bacterial Proteins ', ' Bacterial Gene Products ', ' Bacterial Gene Proteins ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Borrelia burgdorferi ', ' B burgdorferi ', ' B. burgdorferi ', ' Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto ', ' Lyme Disease Spirochete ', ' lyme spirochete ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Laboratory Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Immunoglobulin G ', ' 7S Gamma Globulin ', ' IgG ', ' Immunoglobulin M ', ' 19S Gamma Globulin ', ' IgM ', ' Infection ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lyme Disease ', ' Lyme Borreliosis ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Musculoskeletal System ', ' locomotor system ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Paper ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patents ', ' Patients ', ' Peptides ', ' Physicians ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' DBL Oncoprotein ', ' oncogene protein DBL ', ' p66 ', ' protein DBL ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Serology ', ' OspC protein ', ' Outer surface protein C ', ' ospC ', ' Individual ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Protein Binding ', ' bound protein ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Spottings ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' System ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' rapid diagnosis ', ' Speed ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' cross reactivity ', ' portability ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' ImProv ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' CD61 ', ' CD61 Antigens ', ' GP IIIa ', ' GP3A ', ' GPIIIa ', ' ITGB3 ', ' Integrin Beta 3 ', ' Integrin beta3 ', ' Integrin β3 ', ' NAIT ', ' PTP gene ', ' Platelet Fibrinogen Receptor, Beta Subunit ', ' Platelet GPIIIa ', ' Platelet Glycoprotein IIIa ', ' Platelet Membrane Glycoprotein IIIa ', ' ITGB3 gene ', ' Address ', ' Defect ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reader ', ' Antigen Targeting ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' point of care ', ' cost ', ' multiplex detection ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' cost effective ', ' blind ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Microbe ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' relapsing fever borrelia ', ' decorin binding protein B ', ' DbpB ', ' prototype ', ' public health relevance ', ' efficacy testing ', ' point-of-care diagnostics ', ' biological systems ', ' screening ', ' Borrelia miyamotoi ', ' B miyamotoi ', ' B. miyamotoi ', ' diagnostic assay ', ' preservation ', ' antibody detection ', ' antibody based detection ', ' detect antibodies ', ' rapid test ', ' rapid assay ', ' rapid tests ', ' point-of-care detection ', ' detection assay ', ' detection platform ', ' detection system ', ' point of care testing ', ' ']",NIAID,"BIOPEPTIDES, INC.",R44,2021,1000000,NY-01

"Accelerating Site-specific Characterization of Protein Therapeutics with Novel Machine Learning Methods PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Title: Accelerating Site-specific Characterization of Protein Therapeutics with Novel Machine Learning Methods The project seeks to improve reliability and speed up the development of life-saving and life-enhancing, precision, protein therapeutics and magnify the positive impact of biomedical research and education worldwide, leading to a quantum leap in our understanding of the molecular and cellular pathways and mechanisms involved in healthy and diseased biological systems. The development of biologics is bottlenecked across the entire drug development process, from discovery to early stage candidate selection, process development and manufacturing, due to manual intervention in the mass spectrometry data analysis pipeline. Similarly, the proteomics research community is hindered as it moves from analysis of complex mixtures to more in-depth characterization of proteins and their modifications. Novel machine learning methods will be added to MassMatrix’s (LC-MS/MS software) proven analytical engine and visualization platform to minimize the loss of true positive peptide spectral matches. An innovative approach for efficient accountability of experimental data at the chromatogram level will also be researched, developed and added. The latter providing for easy traceability of each peak’s status in the chromatogram as soon as possible, thus providing convenient high-level assessment. Together, these aims are expected to improve the reliability and accuracy of results as well as to significantly reduce the mass spec bottleneck for the pharmaceutical industry and the research community. Deeper understanding and better decision making will follow, both having a potentially dramatic positive impact on downstream processes and resource deployment, including improved drug safety and efficacy.

"Screening of Glycan Markers in Serum for Early Detection of HCC in Different Etiologies of Disease Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is rising in incidence in the US. 90% of patients in the US with liver cancer have underlying cirrhosis, thus guideline recommendations recommend surveillance in all patients with cirrhosis to facilitate early detection. Unfortunately, only 20-30% of patients are detected with early detection and are thus eligible for potentially curative treatments. There is an unmet need for reliable biomarkers for HCC to facilitate adherence to screening and for early detection. In the proposed work we will develop early detection strategies for HCC based on glycoproteomic profiles. Unique changes in glycosylation in proteins, which involve structural changes in glycan groups, have been shown to be important serum biomarkers for early cancer detection. Importantly, the subtle changes may only involve minor structures but they can be very specific in differentiating cirrhosis versus early versus late stage HCC. In addition, these changes may be specific to the etiology of liver disease. These glycan structural changes will be detected and monitored quantitatively using a mass spectrometry approach which has proven to be an accurate way to characterize even minor changes in structure which may be significant as biomarkers based on our previous mass analysis, tandem mass spectrometry measurements and databases which have been developed for glycan and glycopeptide analysis. This will be demonstrated for both glycan and glycopeptide screening from serum using novel extraction and separation methods coupled to mass spectrometry which can ultimately be used to distinguish early stage HCC from cirrhosis. The proposed work will deliver separations and mass spec methods enabling isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, permitting unequivocal assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We will be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers. Novel software will be developed and used to assign these glycan structures. The markers will be discovered for specific etiologies of HCV-related, alcohol-related and NAFLD-related etiologies of HCC. This will be a multisite study to include all components required for a tumor biomarker lab including samples and sample preparation, separations and mass spec analysis, bioinformatics evaluation and statistical analysis. Ultimately, we will develop methods for discovery of glycan/glycopeptide markers from patient serum, the identification of potential markers and the development of new assays to provide a limited confirmation of these markers. Project Narrative: The proposed work will use new separations and mass spec methods to provide isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, resulting in detailed assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We expect to be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers.

"A knowledge graph framework for automated gating analysis of cytometry data Project Summary / Abstract Flow and mass cytometry provide multiparametric single-cell data critical for understanding the cellular heterogeneity in various biological systems. Modern polychromatic flow cytometers simultaneously measure about 16 parameters routinely. The next-generation mass cytometry (CyTOF) technology allows for the simultaneous measurement of 50 or more parameters. Even as the cytometry technology is rapidly advancing, approaches for analyzing such complex data remain inadequate. The widely-used manual gating analysis is knowledge-driven and easy-to- interpret, but it is subjective, labor-intensive, and not scalable to handle the increasing complexity of the data. Recent developments of automated data-driven algorithms are able to address the issues of manual gating, but the results from data-driven algorithms are often not intuitive for biology experts to interpret. These limitations create a critical bottleneck for flow and mass cytometry analysis. The overall objective of this application is to develop a novel framework that combines both knowledge-driven and data-driven approaches to achieve automated gating analysis of flow cytometry and CyTOF data. The specific aims are: (1) build knowledge graphs to capture existing knowledge of manual gating analysis, (2) develop algorithms for automated gating analysis, and (3) validate the knowledge graph framework using large-scale studies in ImmPort. The proposed research is significant because it will enable efficient and reproducible gating analysis and provide visualizations that are easy-to-interpret, both of which are critically important to the research community. Such contributions will fundamentally impact single-cell analysis of cellular heterogeneity in diverse fields including immunology, infectious diseases, cancer, AIDS, among others. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it is expected to develop novel computational methods for automated analysis and interpretation of single-cell analysis by flow and mass cytometry.

"Bruker RapifleX MALDI TOF/TOF Mass Spectrometer Project Summary/Abstract This proposal requests funding for a Bruker rapifleX matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) time-of- flight/time-of-flight (TOF/TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) instrument to be placed in the MS Facility in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn). The rapifleX will replace a 2008 Bruker Ultraflex III MALDI TOF/TOF for high resolution and MS/MS analysis of biomacromolecules. This is an essential capability for the user community of NIH-funded chemical biology researchers at UPenn synthesizing modified peptides, proteins, and oligonucleotides. The rapifleX is not merely a replacement for the UltrafleX III, its improved resolution and MS/MS capabilities will permit analysis of complex PTMs or cross-links that are challenging on current MALDI and electrospray ionization systems at UPenn. Furthermore, the rapifleX provides new capabilities not currently found in any MS system at UPenn, allowing users to conceive of new areas of research. Ultra-high throughput screening (uHTS) analysis and MALDI MS imaging (MSI) will take biomedical research at UPenn in new directions. The uHTS capabilities will enable experiments to characterize enzyme and small molecule reactions, including monitoring the kinetics of post-translational modifications on authentic peptide and protein substrates and machine-learning enhanced experiments exploring combinatorial effects of reagents and additives in reactions (in collaboration with the High Throughput Experimentation Center and Merck developers of uHTS experiments). Most significantly, the rapifleX will bring the exciting capability of MSI to UPenn. Among the projects included in this application are those that use state-of-the-art imaging methods with the rapifleX to address important research questions in areas such as cancer, viral and bacterial infections, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Disease, or diabetes and obesity. Also included is a project that pushes beyond the state-of-the-art to develop new MSI technologies using the rapifleX that will vastly increase the information content from targeted imaging. The addition of the rapifleX will have an immediate and lasting impact on more than 20 highly active investigators and more than 200 trainees carrying out research that spans nine institutes of the NIH. This includes chemical biology, biophysics, organic chemistry, neuroscience, and translational research programs, as well as NIH T32-funded trainees. The rapifleX will also significantly benefit NIH-funded research programs in schools across UPenn, including the Perelman School of Medicine, School of Engineering and Applied Science, and School of Veterinary Medicine, as well as at neighboring institutions such as the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, Drexel University, and Thomas Jefferson University. The rapifleX will be a key instrument in a broad overhaul of the UPenn Chemistry MS Facility, making it a center of excellence for the region.

More than 20 faculty research groups (encompassing more than 200 researchers) in the Chemistry Department, in other UPenn departments, and at neighboring institutions, will benefit from access to this instrument, leading to MS-enabled breakthroughs in NIH-funded projects of relevance to cancer, viral and bacterial infections, neurodegenerative disease, diabetes, and obesity, among other disorders.",Bruker RapifleX MALDI TOF/TOF Mass Spectrometer,10177330,S10OD030460,"[""Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Bacterial Infections ', ' bacteria infection ', ' bacterial disease ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Chemistry ', ' Organic Chemistry ', ' Communities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Engineering ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Pediatric Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Institutes ', ' Kinetics ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Oligonucleotides ', ' Oligo ', ' oligos ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Peptides ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Post-Translational Protein Processing ', ' Post-Translational Modification Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Post-Translational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Protein Modification ', ' Posttranslational Modifications ', ' Posttranslational Protein Processing ', ' Protein Modification ', ' Proteins ', ' Reagent ', ' Request for Proposals ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Schools ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Veterinary Schools ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Veterinary Medicine ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' viral infection ', ' virus infection ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' crosslink ', ' cross-link ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chemicals ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization ', ' MALD-MS ', ' MALDI ', ' MALDI-MS ', ' Spectroscopy, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization ', ' matrix assisted laser desorption ionization ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Reaction ', ' System ', ' Applied Science ', ' Applied Research ', ' High Throughput Assay ', ' high throughput screening ', ' Institution ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' small molecule ', ' Address ', ' Resolution ', ' Electrospray Ionization ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Monitor ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' mass spectrometer ', ' Imaging technology ', ' combinatorial ', ' targeted imaging ', ' biomacromolecule ', ' biomacromolecular ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' translational research program ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' ']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,S10,2021,881298,PA-03
"Methods for determination of glycoprotein glycosylation similarities among disease states Abstract This application addresses NIGMS PAR-17-045 “Focused Technology Research and Development (R01)”. This initiative supports projects that focus solely on development of technologies with the potential to enable biomedical research. Dysregulation of the cellular microenvironment occurs in cancers, neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric diseases. Known as the matrisome, the set of extracellular matrix and cell surface molecules control the availability of growth factors to cellular receptors and the mechanical-physical properties of the cell microenvironment. Currently, the limited understanding of regulation of matrisome glycosylation hinders understanding of the roles of glycosylation-dependent matrisome networks in the basic mechanisms necessary for targeted intervention of many diseases. Matrisome function depends on networks of interaction among glycosylated proteins and glycan-binding lectins. It is not possible using present proteomics and glycoproteomics methods to compare using rigorous statistics similarities of glycoproteins that differ by disease-related changes in site-specific glycosylation. We propose to develop technologies to meet this need. Present proteomics methods quantify proteins using a few representative peptides per gene product; sequence coverage for most proteins is low. Such low sequence coverage does not suffice to reconstruct the predominant glycosylated proteoforms active in a biological context. We propose to develop technologies to compare glycoprotein similarities among biological sample sets. To do this, we will develop MS acquisition and bioinformatics methods for rapid, sensitive and reproducible mapping of glycoprotein glycosylation to enable statistically rigorous comparison of glycoprotein similarities. By making these technologies available, we will enable a new level of understanding of the roles of matrisome networks in human diseases. Project narrative The matrisome consists of glycosylated extracellular matrix and cell surface proteins that surround cells and support normal physiological activity. While it is known that glycosylation changes during disease processes, it has not been possible to quantitatively compare glycoprotein structure among biological samples.

"Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful technique that enables label-free spatial mapping of different classes of biomolecules in biological systems. Because it does not require any special sample pretreatment, ambient MSI is particularly attractive for high throughput automated imaging applications. The throughput of ambient MSI experiments is typically limited by the inherently slow microprobe-type sampling from surfaces, which is a characteristic shortcoming of many chemical imaging modalities. This project will combine several highly innovative approaches to address challenges associated with the high-throughput high- resolution ambient MSI of lipids and metabolites using nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano-DESI). Nano-DESI is an ambient ionization technique, which relies on gentle localized liquid extraction of molecules from tissue sections into a flowing solvent confined between two glass capillaries. The extracted molecules are efficiently delivered to a mass spectrometer inlet and ionized by soft electrospray ionization. Nano-DESI MSI enables detection of hundreds of metabolites, lipids, and peptides in tissue sections with high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, and without special sample pretreatment. Furthermore, on-the-fly quantification of lipids and metabolites in tissue sections during nano-DESI imaging experiments is achieved by doping the working solvent with appropriate standards of known concentration. This project will extend these powerful capabilities of nano-DESI MSI to enable high-throughput imaging of large tissue sections of interest to the HubMAP Consortium. This will be achieved using a combination of a conceptually different nano-DESI probe design optimized for robustness, ease of fabrication, and spatial resolution and a suite of advanced machine learning and compressed sensing computational approaches.

"Platelet mass microarchitecture as a regulator of thrombin production Project summary Thrombin is a critical element of the hemostatic/thrombotic response, as evidenced by the large number of clinically relevant pro- and anti-coagulant therapies designed to regulate its generation or activity. Thrombin regulation is not a purely biochemical matter, but rather it emerges from the interaction of the biochemical cascade with the evolving physical microenvironment (i.e., platelet deposition). As such, in order to determine how reaction rates of the coagulation cascade may be impacted inside of a hemostatic (or thrombotic) mass we need to study the tightly-woven interaction between the biochemical reactions responsible for thrombin generation and the physical environment in which they occur. Our primary objective is to answer a fundamental question: can the narrow pores of a hemostatic mass operate as a ‘molecular barrier’ and terminate thrombin generation? If so, this would represent an understudied mechanism mediated by platelets and/or fibrin, and the structure they form following accumulation, at a site of injury. The hypothesized molecular barrier results from the hindered movement of soluble species through the evolving hemostatic mass microenvironment. Hemostatic masses are defined by a complex network of mesoscopic scale pores with dimensions of a few to tens of nanometers, and as a result, biochemical reactions relevant to clotting occur in extremely confined spaces. Previous studies explored the idea that the physical environment of a hemostatic plug may contribute to regulating the hemostatic response, but an accurate knowledge of the microstructure of a hemostatic mass remains elusive. Our proposed studies will address this bottleneck by combining novel volume imaging electron microscopy methods of hemostatic masses with artificial intelligence methods to create anatomically realistic domains for simulations of coagulation biochemistry. In Aim #1, in collaboration with Dr. Weisel (letter attached), we will acquire sequential image stacks of hemostatic masses formed in vivo using correlative multi-photon fluorescence and Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron microscopy. In Aim #2, we employ artificial intelligence methods to perform accurate image-driven 3D reconstruction of hemostatic mass microarchitectures, using the image stacks generated in Aim #1. As part of a related research project, we have already acquired an initial set of transmission electron microscopy images of hemostatic thrombi at single-platelet resolution to guide our initial computational efforts. In Aim #3, we will use the reconstructions obtained to examine how the hemostatic mass microarchitecture impedes molecular transport. We will evolve simulations to systematically evaluate how pore size and molecule size interact to regulate molecular diffusion. Finally, we will ask whether limitations in molecular transport through the hemostatic mass are responsible for the termination of thrombin production at a local level. If confirmed, this mechanism will represent a fundamental shift in the way we understand the role of platelet activation and accumulation, the hallmarks of hemostasis and thrombosis. Project Narrative The coagulation biochemical cascade and platelets work together as part of the normal response to vascular injury, called hemostasis, producing a plug that limits blood loss. By contrast, an improper hemostatic response results in numerous clinical problems, including excessive bleeding (e.g., hemophilia), or vascular occlusion that damages tissues such as the heart and brain (i.e., heart attacks and strokes). The goal of this project is to understand if the biochemical reactions of the coagulation cascade are regulated by the architecture of the hemostatic plug, and then translate that understanding into improved methods to treat disorders of the hemostatic system.",Platelet mass microarchitecture as a regulator of thrombin production,10218337,R21HL153946,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anticoagulants ', ' Anticoagulant Agents ', ' Anticoagulant Drugs ', ' blood thinner ', ' thrombopoiesis inhibitor ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor ', ' Coagulation Factors ', ' clotting factor ', ' Blood Platelets ', ' Marrow platelet ', ' Platelets ', ' Thrombocytes ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Coagulants ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diffusion ', ' Drug Design ', ' Elements ', ' Feedback ', ' Fibrin ', ' Fluorescence ', ' Goals ', ' Heart ', ' Hemophilia A ', ' Factor VIII Deficiency ', ' Hemophilia ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Hemostatic function ', ' Hemostasis ', ' Hemostatic Agents ', ' Hemostatics ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Ions ', ' Structure of jugular vein ', ' Jugular Veins ', ' Kinetics ', ' Methods ', ' Microscopy ', ' Electron Microscopy ', ' Scanning Electron Microscopy ', ' Monte Carlo Method ', ' Monte Carlo algorithm ', ' Monte Carlo calculation ', ' Monte Carlo procedure ', ' Monte Carlo simulation ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary infarction ', ' heart attack ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart infarction ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Platelet Activation ', ' pressure ', ' Production ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Testing ', ' Thrombin ', ' Thrombase ', ' fibrinogenase ', ' Thrombosis ', ' thrombotic disease ', ' thrombotic disorder ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Mediating ', ' Thrombus ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Biochemical ', ' Training ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Therapeutic Agents ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' instrument ', ' Knowledge ', ' nano meter ', ' nanometer ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Physical environment ', ' particle ', ' success ', ' Hemostatic Disorders ', ' Confined Spaces ', ' Transmission Electron Microscopy ', ' Structure ', ' chemical reaction rate ', ' reaction rate ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Clotting ', ' Coagulation ', ' Coagulation Process ', ' Address ', ' Enzymatic Reaction ', ' Biochemical Reaction ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Collection ', ' Transport Process ', ' Molecular Transport ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' multi-photon ', ' reconstruction ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' Geometry ', ' microscopic imaging ', ' microscope imaging ', ' microscopy imaging ', ' high resolution imaging ', ' nanometer resolution ', ' vascular injury ', ' injury to the vasculature ', ' thrombotic ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2021,236604,PA-03
"Biomarking IBD patient-specific disease features using the epithelial antigenic peptidome Project Summary/Abstract  In immune-mediated diseases such as type1 diabetes, target-cell autoantibodies have emerged as important clinical biomarkers of pre-clinical disease progression and mechanistic disease subsets. However, with the focus on genetics, inflammatory effectors, and microbiome, there has not been a modern search for such antibody biomarkers and the potential contribution of anti-epithelial autoimmunity in IBD. This project tests the hypothesis that ulcerative colitis phenotypes are distinguished by autoantibodies to mucosal epithelial proteins, addressed in two aims.  In the first aim, we apply the innovative peptide expression display (PED) technology to display and analyze the antigenic epithelial peptidome. This includes bioinformatically determining a comprehensive tabulation of human proteins with high likelihood for antigenicity and ileal-colonic epithelial expression; and, representing these proteins as tiled peptide epitopes with linked cognate oligonucleotides suitable for NGS-based identification and quantitation.  In the second aim, we will assess archival sera of 654 well-characterized colonic IBD patients and non-IBD controls to quantitate individual profiles of epithelial protein binding in relation to two outcomes of ulcerative colitis (UC). The significance of the project has been endorsed by the IBD Genetics Consortium (IBDGC), which made the UC colectomy cohort a research priority, and will collaborate with this R21 via archival serum samples and associated genetics and clinical metadata from the consortium UC patients and controls. Our primary study will compare 300 UC subjects, equally divided into severe and mild phenotypes of outcome based on time to colectomy. Our secondary study will compare 154 UC post-colectomy pouch patients, divided into severe and absent pouchitis phenotypes. We will also study two age-matched reference populations. Bioinformatic analyses will test for shared peptide specificities associated with disease state (UC vs. non-IBD controls) and each of the two extreme phenotypes (severe vs. mild UC; chronic pouchitis vs. late non-pouchitis). We also will perform exploratory tests for the role of IBD predictive risk scores and select genetic loci on autoantibody specificities.  If successful, this project will establish feasibility for the hypothesis, and foundational targets to pursue mechanistic and clinical biomarker studies that may validate and refine its implications for IBD pathogenesis and clinical applications. Project narrative In immune-mediated diseases such as type-1 diabetes, target-cell autoantibodies have emerged as important clinical biomarkers of pre-clinical disease progression and mechanistic disease subsets.

"A data-driven approach towards generation of permeable peptide therapeutics Project Summary  A staggering number of potential targets for combating diseases fall into a category called undruggable, targets that are not accessible to two commonly used drug modalites: antibodies and small molecules. These undruggable targets often reside inside the cells and cannot be accessed by antibodies, which are too large to cross the cell membrane. Their flat surfaces deviate from the common deep pockets that are often hit by small molecules. To untap the potential of these targets, we need a therapeutic modality that can target shallow pockets and cross the cell membrane. Peptides are at the size range and composition that can be an ideal choice as this alternative modality.  Despite efforts in developing high affinity peptide binders, generating permeable binders has been a long-standing challenge. The few examples of cell permeable functional peptides are often developed through error and trial or via many rounds of modification and testing. The challenge in obtaining permeable binders is mainly due to lack of high throughput methods to screen for permeability, which has not only limited the power of library-based screening for obtaining permeable binders, but has also resulted in a limited amount of experimental data from which one can deduce rules that govern a peptide permeable. Thus, the use of peptides as therapeutics to drug the undruggable has remained largely underdeveloped.  This proposal uses an interdisciplinary approach to address this challenge. We generate a network to represent the peptide space in a meaningful manner. We then cluster this network and select for experimental testing a set that is truly representative of the peptide space. The results of our tests, which include both artificial membrane analysis and cellular uptake in bacterial and mammalian cells, can thus be generalized to the entire space. This unprecedented dataset will then be used as a starting point to gain better understanding of peptide permeability and to develop experimental and computational methods for rapid identification of permeable peptide binders that can be used as leads for therapeutic development. We will use this dataset to develop an automated generative algorithm that computationally designs permeable peptides that can target a target interface of interest.  This proposal is a leap in the field of peptide therapeutic development. The dataset generated during this work and methods we develop will be the stepping stone for many researchers interested in drug discovery, physics-based models of permeability, and peptide therapeutics. Project Narrative  A large portion of potential drug targets are inaccessible to the most widely used therapeutic modalities: small molecules and antibodies. Peptides are powerful alternatives for drugging these targets; however, their use has been hugely underexplored due to challenges in the way of obtaining cell-permeable peptides that can access intracellular targets. In this proposal, we use a novel data-driven approach that combines state-of-the-art computational techniques, such as peptide design and machine learning, with experimental data generation to develop methods and datasets that will pave the way for the development of next generation cell-permeable peptide therapeutics.",A data-driven approach towards generation of permeable peptide therapeutics,10241206,DP2GM146249,"['Antibodies ', ' Cell membrane ', ' Cytoplasmic Membrane ', ' Plasma Membrane ', ' plasmalemma ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Libraries ', ' Artificial Membranes ', ' Methods ', ' Peptides ', ' Permeability ', ' Physics ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' falls ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Surface ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' uptake ', ' Therapeutic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' interest ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Modality ', ' Modeling ', ' rapid method ', ' rapid technique ', ' drug discovery ', ' Therapeutic Uses ', ' small molecule ', ' Address ', ' Affinity ', ' Data ', ' Mammalian Cell ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' therapeutic development ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' screening ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' peptide drug ', ' therapeutic peptide ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,DP2,2021,1301850,OR-04
