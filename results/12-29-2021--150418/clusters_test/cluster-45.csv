"Applying Machine Learning in the Prediction and Identification of Children Affected by Prenatal Alcohol Exposure Project summary Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), which are caused by prenatal alcohol exposure, occur in up to 5% of the population in the United States, and are associated with lifelong disability. There are multiple difficulties in obtaining an accurate diagnosis of FASD, including subtlety of physical features and heterogeneity in presentation. Consequently, FASD is grossly under-recognized, and the majority of affected children never receive a diagnosis. If FASD could be diagnosed earlier and with more reliability, many years of beneficial intervention would not be lost. The objective of this research is to apply machine learning to high-dimensional data in well-characterized data sets to predict or characterize children with FASD. The central hypothesis of this research is that the application of machine learning will accurately predict and recognize FASD compared with expert clinical diagnosis. To test this hypothesis, machine learning will be employed to: 1) characterize FASD based on the presence of non-cardinal malformations, 2) establish multivariate predictors of FASD in preschool aged children, and 3) identify diagnosis specific neurodevelopmental markers that distinguish alcohol related neurodevelopmental deficits from neurodevelopmental deficits without prenatal exposure. Two secondary data sources will be used in this proposal; a prospective study of 400 pregnant women and their offspring in Ukraine (half of whom consumed high amounts of alcohol) with full clinical evaluations for FASD, and a cross- sectional study of over 2,900 first grade children in four regions of the U.S., all with clinical FASD evaluations. Upon successful completion of the proposed research, the expected contribution is for more accurate prediction and recognition of children with FASD. The proposed research is innovative, as it represents a departure from current practice by incorporating machine learning techniques into predictive models of FASD. As a perinatal epidemiologist, I have a strong foundation in analytic techniques, and the advanced training in machine learning will further enhance these skills. Additionally, the disease-focused training in dysmorphology and neurodevelopment will provide a strong foundation to make significant contributions to the field of FASD research. Finally, training and mentoring in grant writing and the responsible conduct of research will provide a strong foundation to transition to an independent researcher. This proposed research builds on previous NIAAA funded research by my interdisciplinary mentoring team, who are all strongly supportive of this research and training plan. This seminal application of machine learning to FASD research will demonstrate its capacity to predict and identify affected children, ultimately leading to earlier intervention of children prenatally exposed to alcohol. Narrative Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are common and result in lifelong disabilities; however, they are clini- cally difficult to identify, and the vast majority of children with FASD are undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. The proposed research will leverage recent advances in machine learning to better identify children with FASD. These advances would lead to earlier identification and intervention in the lives of children prenatally exposed to alcohol, which can improve their developmental outcomes.",Applying Machine Learning

"Microbiota-Mediated Bidirectional Interactions Between Alcohol Misuse and Post-COVID-19 Syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY Recent data show that 10-30% of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients do not fully recover and suffer from a wide range of symptoms that persist after the SARS-CoV-2 infection has been cleared (so-called post- COVID-19 syndrome or Long Hauler). Severe COVID-19 and associated risk factors appear to increase the risk of developing post-COVID-19 syndrome and yet a substantial number of patients without known risk factors also develop post-COVID-19 syndrome. Thus, additional risk factors leading to post-COVID-19 syndrome must exist. One potential risk factor is excessive alcohol consumption. (1) Alcohol is the most frequently used drug in the United States, and alcohol use increases during public health crises, especially in socioeconomic disadvantaged communities. (2) Alcohol results in inappropriate immune responses to pathogens. (3) Alcohol disrupts intestinal and lung barrier integrity which can further promote inflammation. We recently showed that increased serum Zonulin (a marker of disrupted intestinal barrier integrity) and increased endotoxin (LBP) are associated with inflammation during COVID-19 and can predict disease severity and mortality. Accordingly, we hypothesize that: (a) there is a bidirectional interaction between alcohol misuse and SARS-CoV-2 infection leading to increased risk of post-COVID-19 syndrome in patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and more severe AUD in COVID-19 patients; and (b) the underlying mechanism of these interactions is microbiota dysbiosis and/or disruption of intestinal barrier integrity, promoting inflammation and dysregulated immune-responses to the virus. To test our hypotheses, we will leverage our NIAAA supported COVID-19 supplement at Rush University Medical Center (RUMC), which is actively following more than 7,000 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and 2,000 SARS- CoV-2 negative patients over 12 months using structured questionnaires. All patients are screened for alcohol use/misuse. Furthermore, we will recruit a subset of patients to provide biological samples to test our mechanistic hypothesis evaluating the link between AUD, post-COVID-19 syndrome, and gut-derived inflammation. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that AUD increases the risk and severity of post-COVID-19 syndrome by promoting gut-derived inflammation. (1a) We will determine if increased alcohol use/misuse is associated with risk and severity of post-COVID-19 syndrome. (1b) We will elucidate the role of gut-derived inflammation in AUD promotion of the post-COVID-19 syndrome by interrogating stool microbiota composition/function, systemic markers of intestinal barrier integrity, inflammation, and immune activation. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that COVID-19 increases the risk and severity of AUD and alcohol-induced intestinal barrier disruption. (2a) we will determine whether post-COVID-19 syndrome is associated with increased risk of AUD. (2b) We will determine if COVID-19 decreases resilience of intestinal barrier to the damaging effects of alcohol which would result in increased risk of alcohol-induced intestinal leak that could lead to organ damage using organoids generated from individuals with and without post-COVID-19 and/or AUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study seeks to understand the role of alcohol consumption in COVID-19 long-term complications, hypothesizing that alcohol is an underappreciated risk factor for developing these complications. We also hypothesize that these effects are related to alcohol's ability to cause gut-leakiness during human diseases. The completion of this proposal may identify alcohol misuse (a modifiable lifestyle factor) as a yet unknown risk factor for COVID-19 long-term complications; therefore, it may lead to identify individuals at risk for these long-term complications and to design novel strategies to prevent/treat post-COVID-19 syndrome.",Microbiota-Mediated Bidirectional Interactions Between Alcohol Misuse and

"Striatal fast-spiking interneurons regulate compulsive alcohol consumption Project Summary Alcohol use disorder has a major impact on public health, yet the brain mechanisms driving alcohol misuse are poorly understood. Habits are repetitive motor sequences that persist despite reward devaluation and form the action strategy that underlies compulsive behavior. Chronic alcohol exposure facilitates habit learning and leads to increased habitual behavior in chronic users. The dorsolateral striatum (the putamen in humans) regulates habit learning and its resident inhibitory cells, the fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs), are targeted by alcohol exposure. To determine if alcohol utilizes FSIs to promote compulsive alcohol consumption, I selectively ablated striatal FSIs in animals undergoing a voluntary intermittent drinking paradigm (Drinking in the Dark) and challenged animals with the adulterant quinine to measure compulsive consumption. FSI ablation abolished compulsive alcohol consumption and significantly disrupted organized ethanol lick sequence behavior. The next essential step toward advancing this finding to a clinical application is to determine the specific time window that FSIs are recruited for the formation or maintenance of the motor sequences that underlie compulsive drinking. To this end I propose two aims of investigation using innovative optogenetic and machine learning approaches: 1) to determine if striatal FSIs are necessary for the development of the organized actions of compulsive ethanol consumption and; 2) to determine if striatal FSIs are necessary for the maintenance of organized actions underlying compulsive ethanol consumption. The results of this study will significantly advance our understanding of motor sequence learning, the role of motor sequences in compulsive behavior, and will indicate the necessary time window for future therapeutic interventions targeting compulsive drinking. Project Narrative Alcohol use disorder poses a substantial public health burden that is projected to increase in response to COVID- 19. Compulsive drinking is a core feature of the disorder that is poorly treated by current therapies. This proposal will determine how neural circuits exposed to alcohol give rise to compulsive alcohol consumption behavior and will provide critical training opportunities toward scientific independence for the principal investigator.",Striatal fast-spiking interneurons regulate compulsive alcohol consumption,10387913,F31AA029264,"['Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' alcohol use disorder ', ' ethanol use disorder ', ' Ethanol ', ' Absolute ethanol ', ' ETOH ', ' Ethyl Alcohol ', ' Grain Alcohol ', ' Methylcarbinol ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Animals ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Habits ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Maintenance ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Parvalbumins ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' putamen ', ' Quinine ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Left ', ' Dorsal ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Individual ', ' Therapeutic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Ablation ', ' fluorophore ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' novel ', ' drinking ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' response ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' habit learning ', ' Outcome ', ' alcohol misuse ', ' ethanol misuse ', ' unhealthy alcohol use ', ' Consumption ', ' drinking behavior ', ' National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism ', ' NIAAA ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', "" men's group "", ' male group ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' sequence learning ', ' drug of abuse ', ' abused drug ', ' abused drugs ', ' drug abused ', ' drugs abused ', ' drugs of abuse ', ' alcohol exposure ', ' alcohol exposed ', ' ethanol exposed ', ' ethanol exposure ', ' exposed to alcohol ', ' exposed to ethanol ', ' exposure to alcohol ', ' exposure to ethanol ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' alcohol testing ', ' ethanol testing ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic strategies ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' treatment strategy ', ' alcohol-related death ', ' optogenetics ', ' Compulsive Behavior ', ' training opportunity ', ' recruit ', ' COVID-19 ', ' COVID19 ', ' CV-19 ', ' CV19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' ']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,F31,2021,38324,MD-07
"Cortical subcortical reorganization and risk behaviors of early alcohol use initiation Project Summary/Abstract Early initiation of alcohol use (EIAU) during adolescence is a key contributor to development of lifetime alcohol (AUD) and/or substance use disorders (SUDs). A critical component for preventing and intervening EIAU is early detection using behavioral or cognitive risk precursors; and understanding better their underlying neural substrates before the onset of substance use may aid in developing more effective and targeted interventions. Prior studies suggest sleep disturbance, internalizing behaviors, externalizing behaviors, and cognitive performance are potential risk precursors of EIAU. However, mixed or inconsistent findings have been reported which may reflect study design and methodological issues, and the neural substrates subserving co- development of these frequently occurring problems remain to be identified. In this application, we propose to use data from the longitudinal Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study to investigate the neural substrates that are predictive of EIAU and its risk precursors. A number of advanced analytical approaches will be used to extract novel features at both structural and functional levels. For example, the Joint and Individual Variance Explained (JIVE) method will be used to extract biologically meaningful cortical-subcortical covariation patterns. Existing literature and our preliminary results led us to hypothesize that the cortical-subcortical covariation pattern including brainstem, thalamus, prefrontal cortex and other regions underlies the co- development of sleep, internalizing behaviors, externalizing behaviors, and poor cognitive function from late childhood to mid-adolescence. Specifically, this project has three complementary aims. Aim 1 will assess the relationships between the baseline cortical-subcortical covariation patterns and EIAU and its four risk precursors in mid-adolescence. Aim 2 will characterize the developmental trajectory of cortical-subcortical covariation pattern and assess its dynamic relationship with the four risk precursors longitudinally. Aim 3 will explore whether functional connectivity predicts sleep disturbance, cognitive performance, behavioral problems, and/or age at first alcohol use. Results from this application will significantly advance the field of addiction neuroscience. Project Narrative Problematic use of alcohol, marijuana and tobacco represent enormous public health costs, and use of substances, particularly alcohol, often begins in adolescence. The big data approach proposed in this application will lead to identification of neural factors linked to risk precursors for early initiation of alcohol and other substance use, including sleep problems, internalizing behaviors, externalizing behaviors, and cognitive impairment in late childhood and early adolescence. The results generated from this project will inform the rationale for designing early detection and intervention before onset of alcohol/substance use in adolescents.",Cortical subcortical

"CNS Deficits:  Interaction of Age and Alcoholism PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Hazardous alcohol use has grown substantially in the aging population. It remains unknown whether Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) and its alcohol-related cognitive and brain decline increases risk for diagnostic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or even can result in classic irreversible dementia. Motivating the proposal are 1) our longitudinal findings of accelerated aging of selective brain structures in AUD; 2) results of an animal model of high alcohol exposure in old compared with young, well-nourished male and female rats; and 3) preliminary results from non-alcoholic individuals meeting MCI criteria compared with AUD with similar extent of cognitive deficits revealing different age-related patterns of brain degradation. The findings led us to consider factors of nutritional deficiency and cytokine dysregulation that occur in both AUD and MCI and have the potential to contribute to common and unique disruption, accelerated by aging, of selective brain circuitry and cognitive sequelae in each diagnosis. We will test 180 actively drinking men and women (60 AUD, 60 non-alcoholic MCI, and 60 age-matched controls) before and after 18-24 months with structural MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Recognizing mnemonic compromise associated with AUD and MCI, primary hypotheses will target the integrity of nodes and connections of Papez (limbic) circuit; white matter integrity will be assessed with deterministic fiber tracking and node-to-node integrity with probabilistic fiber tracking. Causal modeling will test the influence of specific independent variables of alcohol, nutrition, age, and sex hypothesized to have direct effects on inflammation and thalamic-hippocampal or cingulate-entorhinal connectivity, which, in turn, exert mediating influences on episodic memory. In addition to quantification of alcohol use and nutritional and inflammatory markers, modifiable risk factors to be examined include smoking, licit and illicit drugs, obesity-BMI, blood pressure, and physical activity. The parallel animal study will focus on the interaction of alcohol binge exposure and nutritional challenge with graded levels of thiamine deficiency and resulting cytokine, brain structure and connectivity, and behavioral sequelae in rats. AIM 1: In cross-sectional study, model for each diagnosis the influence of independent variables (i.e., alcohol, nutrition, age, and sex) and hypothesized mediating factors (i.e., inflammation) affecting neurocircuitry substrates of episodic memory. AIM 2: In longitudinal study, use trajectory analysis to quantify interim change in targeted neurocircuitry as a function of age. Causal modeling will use longitudinal change data of the independent variables. AIM 3: In longitudinal study, determine whether nutritional (thiamine) deficits are sufficient to produce enduring MR-detectable responses to high blood alcohol levels in wild-type Wistar rats. PROJECT NARRATIVE Among the aging population it remains unknown whether Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) and its alcohol-related cognitive and brain decline increases risk for diagnostic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or even can result in a classic irreversible dementia. Characterization of brain pathology and its relation to cognitive deficits in AUD compared with MCI and identification of modifiable risk factors may provide biological markers and enhance mechanistic understanding of these disorders. Development of a translational animal model of AUD brain pathology will permit discovery of biological factors in addition to alcohol itself that contribute to brain damage and inform intervention and treatment efforts for reversing pathology and impairment.",CNS Deficits:  Interaction of Age and Alcoholism,10233735,R01AA005965,"['Physical activity ', ' Fiber ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Memory

"Optimizing Brief Alcohol Interventions for Young Adults via Computational Methods Project Summary The goal of this Independent Scientist Award (K02) is to seek “protected time” for a period of intensive research focus to enhance the Candidate’s career development and to conduct research on the comparative effectiveness of competing brief alcohol interventions and their mechanisms. The proposed research strategy represents an ongoing, NIAAA-supported independent research program (R01 AA019511: Estimating Comparative Effectiveness of Alcohol Interventions for Young Adults, received 3rd percentile score). This K02 extends the R01 by (1) including an additional 25 data sets of individual participant data from brief alcohol interventions conducted between 2013 and 2020, and (2) embracing machine learning algorithms and other state-of-the-art statistical methods to help identify mechanisms of behavior change and to integrate and synthesize them across heterogeneous studies. The proposed protected time will be critical to update and enrich my research program in this current, rapidly changing clinical research environment. With accumulating high-quality clinical data and real-world data in the context of emerging data science capabilities, there exist opportunities as well as challenges. I am well suited to tackle emerging challenges for unprecedented opportunities, given my work in statistical data integration and broad experience in alcohol research. I want to create a large database where one can simultaneously examine secular/cohort effects, intervention effects, and effect heterogeneity at the most granular data level by developing and using new tools. My career goal is to become “one of the major hubs,” connecting disparate networks of researchers into a large connected network, promoting fluid interactions. The synergy from the large, interdisciplinary network would be helpful toward creating a “value” proposition of Big Data – the sum of the knowledge and insights from the collaboration by investigators is greater than isolated pursuits by each. Toward this goal, career development activities will be to (1) train in computational machine learning algorithms and real-world large-dimensional data analysis to facilitate collaboration with addiction researchers and statisticians; (2) enhance my understanding of technology-assisted adaptive interventions and passively collected outcomes data; (3) update my knowledge in basic health sciences related to addiction; and (4) submit at least two publications and two grants per year using newly acquired knowledge and skills proposed under K02. I have identified six highly active, nationally acclaimed experts in their respective fields. I will have individual and group research meetings with all six collaborators (three new collaborators for this K02) to develop innovative projects. In addition, I will attend workshops and conferences for training, carry out online training, and have guided reading and discussion with collaborators. I will visit collaborators for in-depth discussions and problem-solving. Improving big data capabilities for biomedical and clinical research has been one of the major strategic plans of the NIH, and I am motivated and prepared to help meet that critical mission. Project Narrative Through innovative, comparative effectiveness research, we can improve interventions and develop individualized intervention strategies, which will reduce the serious negative consequences associated with heavy drinking and enhance the lives of adolescents and young adults. The results of this study will have a significant impact for all major stakeholders, including adolescents and young adults in need of treatment and their families, trial developers/researchers, school administrators. More broadly, this research will strengthen research practice, enhance transparency, and maximize the benefits of data sharing.",Optimizing Brief Alcohol Interventions for Young Adults via

"Towards a Wearable Alcohol Biosensor: Examining the Accuracy of BAC Estimates from New-Generation Transdermal Technology using Large-Scale Human Testing and Machine Learning Algorithms A wearable alcohol biosensor could represent a tremendous advance towards helping people make informed decisions about their drinking and, ultimately, towards curbing alcohol-related morbidity and mortality. Transdermal sensors, which measure alcohol consumption by assessing the alcohol content of insensible perspiration, offer a uniquely non-invasive, passive, and low-cost method for the continuous assessment of drinking likely to be attractive to a range of populations. But the relationship between transdermal alcohol concentration (TAC) and blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is highly complex, varying across individuals and contexts and involving some degree of lag time. Prior research, which has featured extremely small participant samples and examined old-generation transdermal devices, has been poorly suited to modeling this complexity. Thus, scientists are left with little sense for how to translate data produced by transdermal sensors into estimates of BAC. Importantly, the past decade has seen remarkable technological and analytic developments, offering the potential to tackle the challenge of TAC-BAC translation. In particular, in recent years, machine learning approaches have been developed that are particularly well suited to modeling highly complex and time-lagged relationships within larger datasets. Also during this time period, a new generation of transdermal device has come under development, featuring sleek/compact designs, smartphone integration, and capabilities for sampling TAC at approximately 90 times the rate of older-generation devices. These sensors thus provide a rich source of data for machine learning models and also, for the first time, the potential to produce transdermal BAC estimates in real time. The proposed research leverages machine learning, novel transdermal technology, and large-scale multimodal human testing to translate transdermal sensor data into estimates of BAC. Transdermal sensors will be examined in the context of multimodal research featuring a large and diverse participant sample (N=240) examined both inside and outside the laboratory. The ambulatory arm of the proposed project is aimed at capturing the TAC-BAC relationship across individuals in varying real-world drinking contexts, examining regular drinkers wearing new-generation transdermal sensors in everyday settings while providing prompted breathalyzer readings. This ambulatory research will be complemented by a laboratory study arm, aimed at examining the TAC-BAC relationship among individuals drinking in a controlled setting while alcohol dose and rate of consumption are systematically manipulated. Machine learning algorithms, including deep neural network models, will be used to create estimates of BAC from transdermal sensor data. These estimates will be examined in terms of their accuracy, temporal specificity, and also context-dependence. Thus, results will carry significance for addiction science by translating transdermal sensor data and clarifying the place of these sensors in our arsenal of techniques for assessing, preventing, and treating problem drinking. PROJECT NARRATIVE A wearable alcohol biosensor might serve health needs across a variety of domains, including aiding in the prevention of alcohol-related disorders, improving interventions for treating problem drinking, and refining outcome assessment in alcohol research.

"NCANDA: DATA ANALYSIS RESOURCE PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT During young adulthood, drinking dramatically increases, with binge-level drinking peaking at age 22 and nearly half of individuals who drink report binge-level alcohol use. Frequent binge alcohol use during the protracted neuromaturation extending into the mid 20s may result in greater brain and cognitive effects than similar alcohol use in later adulthood. This application is in response to RFA-AA-17-005, Continuation of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) Data Analysis Resource (U24) to determine the predictors and effects of accelerated alcohol use in adolescence and young adulthood. NCANDA-2 will follow the initial cohort of 831 participants (ages 12-21 at first visit) from 5 collection sites and acquire the necessary data to advance our understanding of adolescent development and the effects of alcohol use on the adolescent and young adult brain using multimodal neuroimaging, cognitive testing, and behavioral assessment. The examination of alcohol consequences will focus on structural and functional maturation of brain areas that actively develop during adolescence, are involved in psychological regulation, respond to rewards, and appear vulnerable to deleterious effects of alcohol. With the additional longitudinal data provided by this renewal, we will determine the effects of alcohol exposure on the developmental trajectory of the adolescent human brain and identify preexisting psychobiological vulnerabilities that may put an adolescent or young adult at elevated risk for an alcohol use disorder. The Data Analysis Resource (DAR) will 1) oversee data collection with standardization and comparability across sites; 2) perform data analysis for core measures collected at each site; 3) facilitate across-site pooling and centralized data storage; 4) create a database across assessment modalities for efficient retrieval; 5) coordinate data and resource sharing; 6) harmonize data across sites; and 7) create and implement novel, multimodality analyses using machine learning to engage broad spectrum data. The DAR has 5 Specific Aims: Aim 1. Maintain standardized procedures for collection of neuroimaging, neuropsychological, and clinical  assessment data and harmonize with existing large-scale neurodevelopmental research efforts. Aim 2. Ensure across-site quality control for imaging and neuropsychological data acquisition. Aim 3. Maintain and advance informatics infrastructure for data submission, analysis, and distribution.  a) Maintain a database integrating the diverse and comprehensive data from all NCANDA sites.  b) Provide data to consortium PIs for hypothesis testing within and across experimental domains. Aim 4. Provide macrostructural, microstructural, and fMRI neuroimage processing and analysis. Aim 5. Develop and maintain a data sharing and distribution system for the scientific public. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Data Analysis Resource will provide analysis of longitudinal data provided by this renewal to determine the extent to which structural and functional deficits in neurodevelopmental maturation precede, are caused by, or are exacerbated by initiation of appreciable alcohol use in adolescence.",NCANDA: DATA ANALYSIS RESOURCE,10187466,U24AA021697,"['Adolescence ',

"Mapping the co-evolution of Craving, Affect, Stressors, and Access to Alcohol (CASA) using responsive EMA ABSTRACT Recovering from Alcohol Use Disorders (AUD) following treatment is difficult, with 43-83% relapsing post- discharge. These chronically high rates arise, in part, because of a gap in our knowledge about the co-evolution of in the moment risk mechanisms associated with relapse among those recovering from AUD, including Craving, Negative Affect, Stressors and Access to alcohol (CASA). These four factors co-evolve among important protective factors that buffer relapse risk (e.g., improved sober support and psychosocial function associated with post-treatment community AUD recovery programs), and context-based risk factors such as near-at-hand places where alcohol is available. The immediate goal of this project is to develop the means to assess and understand the impact of these environmental/contextual factors for recovering alcoholics, towards a longer term research objective of developing effective just-in-time interventions that mitigate the risk of relapse. In this project, we will leverage novel assessment methodologies via a responsive ecological momentary assessment (rEMA) system developed by our team. This app-based system allows researchers to incorporate geospatial, time- specific and event-specific criteria for enhanced monitoring of (and just-in-time delivery of interventions to) recovering patients in post-treatment settings. Consistent with PA-18-620 from NIAAA, this project aims to build foundational evidence and refine the data collection/analysis strategy needed to achieve our long term objective, via the following specific aims: Aim 1) Pilot the use of our rEMA platform to capture fine-grained longitudinal data on Craving, Affect, Stressors and Access to alcohol among 60 recovering alcoholics across 30 days, to evaluate CASA construct validity within rEMA data and assess the extent and impact of data missingness; Aim 2) Test incentive modalities that will inform us regarding best practices that maximize adherence to the rEMA protocol; Aim 3) Develop analytic strategies based machine-learning models of rEMA data, to forecast imminent risk and quantify causal pathways among CASA variables. To accomplish these aims, we will recruit and enroll adults (n=60; 50% female) in non-hospitalized residential AUD treatments in the Central Plains. Using smartphone assessment with GPS monitoring technology, we will collect longitudinal behavioral and experiential data from each participant over 30 days. Analysis of these data will advance our understanding of co-evolving contextual/social-environmental factors that impact the success/failure of the recovery effort, while establishing foundational evidence from which time/event-specific smartphone-based just-in-time interventions may be developed. The final phase of the project includes the creation of an advisory and dissemination board composed of local and national-level stakeholders, AUD treatment practitioners and other researchers that will guide the development of such an intervention. Included in this group are the directors of two non-hospitalized residential substance treatment facilities that function as community partners for the project through all project stages. PROJECT NARRATIVE There is a significant need for reliable fine-grained data on the physical, behavioral, and cognitive dimensions of relapse and recovery among individuals recovering from alcohol use disorders. This study will use cutting-edge responsive ecological momentary assessment software to track craving, affect, stress, alcohol access, and exposure to support/risk locations among a cohort of 60 individuals currently participating in a non-hospitalized residential housing program. This data collection and modeling effort will set the stage for a more nuanced understanding of relapse and recovery risk patterns experienced by those with an alcohol use disorder, while supporting future cost-effective programming of relapse prevention and intervention services.","Mapping the co-evolution of Craving, Affect, Stressors, and Access to Alcohol (CASA) using responsive

"Alcohol-induced cardiac injury and repair in human induced pluripotent stem cell model PROJECT SUMMARY Alcohol exposure is a key risk factor for abnormal heart development and contributes to congenital heart disease, the leading non-infectious cause of infant mortality. Alcohol-induced impaired heart growth and development in early life can also increase the risk of heart disease later in adulthood. Furthermore, adult cardiac system is also sensitive to alcohol exposure, which is an important but underappreciated risk factor contributing to heart disease. Alcohol exposure is associated with ischemic events, arrhythmias and alterations in cardiac function and structure. These pathological consequences could result from complex actions of alcohol including increased cytotoxicity, oxidative stress and abnormal Ca2+ handling. Inflammatory cytokines produced by alcohol exposure could also contribute to alcohol-induced heart injury. However, mechanisms underlying alcohol- induced heart disease are not fully defined and effective therapies are lacking. Traditionally, studies on alcohol exposure have relied on animal models and cells because of limited availability and growth capacity of human primary cardiomyocytes. However, studies in animal models are time consuming, expensive, and not amenable for high-throughput drug screening, and have limitations due to physiological differences from humans. To complement the studies on animal models and cells, we have recently explored the use of cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CMs) as a novel and physiologically relevant model to study alcohol-induced cardiotoxicity. hiPSC-CMs have many features similar to human primary CMs, can be engineered into tissue-like structures and maintained in long-term cultures, and can be adapted for high-throughput platforms. We have demonstrated that exposure of hiPSC-CMs with clinically relevant doses of alcohol can recapitulate pathological events caused by alcohol exposure, including oxidative stress, altered gene expression and cardiac dysfunction as indicated by abnormal Ca2+ handling and contractility. We have adapted hiPSC-CMs into high- throughput formats and established high-throughput assays to detect alcohol-induced cardiotoxicity and screen for cardiac proliferative/protective agents. Using this in vitro human cell model and state-of-the-art high- throughput technologies, we propose to investigate underlying molecular mechanisms of alcohol-induced toxicity in human cardiomyocytes and evaluate potential therapies to mitigate alcohol-induced cytotoxicity. In addition, we plan to investigate the involvement of inflammatory cytokines in alcohol-induced cardiac injury and repair. We expect that our established hiPSC-CM model will help understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying alcohol toxicity in human cardiomyocytes and accelerate the development of targeted and effective therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Prenatal alcohol exposure is a key factor contributing to abnormal heart development and is associated with various cardiac anomalies with serious long-term complications in adulthood. This study aims to discover novel molecular mechanisms and potential therapies to control the detrimental effect of alcohol exposure on cellular and functional properties of heart cells using human

"Brain Function and Neurogenomic influences on AUD risk and resilience. This COGA (Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism) spinoff application aims to understand structural/functional features in key brain networks (Default Mode Network (DMN), Executive Control Network (ECN), Reward/Salience Network (RSN)) underlying the critical transition from regular drinking to DSM-5 Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) in young adult offspring from enriched COGA families, by combining newly ascertained structural, diffusion and functional (s/d/fMRI), Neuropsychological (NPsych) and Electrophysiological (EPhys) data together with existing multimodal longitudinal data (85% with 3+ assessments). The well- characterized, genetically informative COGA sample with many offspring from families densely affected with AUD at higher risk to develop AUD will be moving through the understudied age of young adulthood/early midlife (20's, 30's), when most longitudinal AUD development studies end and when our data predicts that a substantial portion from high density families will transition from regular alcohol use to AUD. This proposal will target 150 young adults (mean age 26) from the COGA study who are current regular drinkers (1/month+ for >6 months, but do not currently meet criteria for DSM-5 AUD), and will follow them longitudinally with a multimodal approach to compare those who transition to DSM-5 AUD and those who do not. We will add s/d/fMRI measures that are not part of the COGA protocol, to provide anatomical specificity to complement current and existing NPsych and EPhys longitudinal data during resting state, and three analogous cognitive/affective tasks [response inhibition (Go/NoGo), reward processing (monetary gambling task), and affect modulation (cognitive/affective Stroop)]. Combining machine learning methods, advanced nonparametric, linear mixed methods, survival model, and joint models of longitudinal data and survival data, we will: (Aim 1) identify features in specific neural circuits (DMN, ECN, RSN) during resting state and during cognitive/affective tasks in young adults who transition from regular drinking to AUD diagnosis from those who do not; (Aim 2) study the effects of drinking behaviors (e.g. age, pattern, duration of alcohol use) on the s/d/fMRI, EPhys, and NPsych features in specific neural circuits associated with the transition to AUD identified in Aim 1; and (Aim 3) determine the role of polygenic risk as measured by polygenic risk score (PRS) derived from alcohol use- and brain-related GWAS, other risk/protective factors [i.e., sex, race/ethnicity, family history, comorbid substance use (nicotine, cannabis), and psychiatric disorders (depression), COVID-related traumatic stress] on neural circuits and their developmental trajectories associated with transitions to AUD identified in Aims 1 and 2. The strength of our diverse, genetically informative, enriched high-risk sample of young adults, longitudinal multimodal measures, and novel integrative analyses will elucidate vulnerabilities and reciprocal relationships among neural circuits, genomic and other risk/protectives factors in the transition to AUD during the 20s and 30s, with utility in prevention and treatment initiatives. This project will address important challenges of understanding deficits in structural and functional brain networks underlying the transition from regular drinking to Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) by investigating multidomain measures of brain function—structural/density-weighted/functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (s/d/fMRI) longitudinal electrophysiological (EEG, Event Related Potential/Oscillation (ERP/ERO)) and neurocognitive data in a genetically informative enriched high risk diverse adolescent and young adult prospective study sample, now entering the understudied age of emerging adulthood to midlife. With the use of novel analytic methods to leverage this unique high risk longitudinal multimodal dataset, with data from before and after the initiation of drinking behaviors, this study will elucidate reciprocal relationships among genomic and other risk/protective factors (e.g., COVID-19 related traumatic stress), sex differences and the role of vulnerabilities in neural circuits in the

"Alcohol Research Consortium in HIV: Ending the HIV Epidemic through interventions and Epidemiology at the intersection of the alcohol and HIV care Continua Established in 2011, the Alcohol Research Consortium in HIV (ARCH) conducts high impact epidemiological and intervention studies that address relationships between at-risk alcohol use and AUD, the HIV Care Continuum (HIV-CC) and health outcomes. ARCH is embedded in and has capitalized on the research and clinical infrastructure of the CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS), an eight site clinical cohort of university-based HIV clinics across the US, with many of these clinics located in high priority regions for Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE). The overarching theme of the proposed P01 is to expand scientific knowledge and treatment interventions at the intersection of the Alcohol-Care Continuum (Alc-CC), HIV-CC and HIV related comorbidities across the full spectrum of alcohol use -- with particular attention to individual context and social determinants of health -- using implementation and epidemiological research. Our scientific goals are: 1) To implement evidence-based alcohol interventions (EBI) across the alcohol use spectrum among PWH using rigorous hybrid-implementation effectiveness designs; 2) To understand how multi-level contextual factors impact the alcohol use spectrum, the Alc-CC and HIV-CC, comorbidities, and intervention responses among PWH; 3) To determine optimal alcohol reduction targets (e.g. abstinence v low-risk drinking, reduction in WHO risk score) among PWH in the context of the Alc-CC, HIV-CC and HIV-related comorbidities. This ARCH P01 has three research projects. We are proposing a Hybrid Type III effectiveness-implementation trial integrating alcohol EBIs into HIV clinical care. This study is a direct extension of our earlier research findings demonstrating a robust effect of a computerized brief intervention embedded in a stepped care treatment approach for PWH with at-risk drinking. Our second project is a Hybrid Type1 effectiveness-implementation pilot trial developing and testing a novel relapse prevention intervention (RPI) for PWH. The importance of our focus on RPI is highlighted by our recent finding that any alcohol use among PWH with AUD is associated with increased viremia and the well-established high relapse prevalence of 50 – 75% of persons in remission. Our epidemiological project will provide outcomes data for the intervention trials as well as examine the full spectrum of alcohol use, the Alc-CC and their relationship to HIV-CC, comorbidities and co-infections in the context of social determinants of health. An administrative core provides the structure and processes to support collaboration and synergy across ARCH projects and investigators. A biostatistics and methods core supports analyses for the three projects and development of novel analytic methods. A transdisciplinary group of investigators brings depth and breadth of expertise to this program. Building on a decade of collaborative research progress and administrative structure in ARCH and capitalizing on the extensive resources of CNICS, this P01 proposal addresses issues of high relevance to the US goal of ending the HIV epidemic and the Office of AIDS Research priorities, including HIV Treatment as Prevention, HIV related comorbidities and disparities. At-risk alcohol use, alcohol use disorder and return to drinking can have negative impacts on people with HIV (PWH). We propose to integrate alcohol reduction and relapse prevention interventions into HIV clinical care settings and to study the long-term effects of the spectrum of alcohol use on the alcohol and HIV care continua, comorbidities and disparities among a large, multi-site cohort of PWH.",Alcohol Research Consortium in HIV: Ending the HIV Epidemic through interventions and Epidemiology at the

"Transcriptome-guided diagnosis and therapy for alcohol use disorder 1 Project Summary/Abstract  2 Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a chronic, relapsing condition and a major public health problem with few  3 pharmaceutical treatments available. Systems-based computational strategies that integrate brain gene  4 expression signatures of rodent models of AUD risk with gene expression signatures of pharmaceuticals show  5 promise for identifying compounds that decrease excessive drinking in rodents. However, this methodology  6 has limited clinical potential because it is not possible to obtain brain specimens from patients. Identifying a  7 clinically accessible tissue would facilitate the application of advanced computational approaches to identify  8 better therapeutics for AUD and personalize AUD treatment. To this end, the proposed research aims to  9 determine whether blood can be used as a surrogate tissue for brain by using a within-subjects design to 10 compare transcript levels in both tissues in mice during protracted withdrawal, a sensitive time for relapse to 11 excessive alcohol drinking. The research will also determine whether whole blood transcriptome profiles can be 12 used to classify subjects according to alcohol dependence status and to computationally predict compounds 13 that reduce alcohol consumption and anxiety- and depression-like behavior. The clinical and mechanistic 14 insights that will emerge from the proposed research should be considered independently. The first could lead 15 to effective diagnostic tools or candidate treatments, whereas the second will provide insight into the 16 pathophysiology of AUD. It might be the case that the blood transcriptome at least partially reflects the changes 17 in brain, and that targeting these changes is therapeutic. Or it might be the case that targeting the blood 18 transcriptome is therapeutic, irrespective of brain changes. The proposed study will provide crucial new 19 knowledge about a relatively new and unexplored area of addiction research that could drive molecular-based 20 diagnostic or therapeutic tools and personalized medicine approaches for AUD or other diseases where brain is 21 the primary affected tissue. Project Narrative Recent evidence in mice suggests that brain gene expression profiles can predict drugs effective for treating alcoholism, but it is not possible to obtain brain specimens from human patients which limits the usefulness of this approach. This research will investigate the extent to which blood can act as a surrogate for brain tissue and predict alcohol dependence status and drug treatments. This information will help to develop molecular- based diagnosis and treatment options for alcoholics and gain insights into the biological mechanisms that might contribute to the transition from recreational alcohol use to excessive drinking.",Transcriptome-guided diagnosis and therapy for alcohol use disorder,10092805,F32AA028148,"['Acids ', ' Affect ', ' Air ', ' Alcohol consumption ', '

"Using Smartphone Assessments for Personalized Prediction of Problematic Alcohol Use PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Risky drinking, such as binge (5+/4+ drinks per 2-hour occasion for males/females) and high-intensity (2-3x the rates of binge) drinking, is highly prevalent among young adults and associated with severe acute and longer-term negative behavioral and health outcomes. However, given its prevalence, individuals who engage in such activities comprise a heterogeneous group. Researchers have had a hard time identifying the varied behavioral processes that are predictive of negative alcohol-related consequences and problematic trajectories across time. Predicting who will go on to develop lasting problems and whose risky alcohol use behavior is developmentally-limited is especially challenging. Part of the hindrance comes from the methods that are currently used to study this diverse behavior. In particular, researchers often use cross-sectional studies to look across individuals. While this has reaped invaluable knowledge regarding differences among individuals in their drinking patterns, it does not reveal the dynamic processes that contribute to maintaining such behaviors or make one more likely to have negative consequences. However, increasingly hypotheses pertain to these dynamic processes. This requires arriving at quantitative descriptions of individuals' emotional and behavioral processes. The science can move towards a more nuanced understanding of the varied mechanisms contributing to problematic alcohol use by arriving at valid descriptions of individual-level (i.e., personalized) processes. We propose to make advances towards personalized quantitative models in four ways: 1) develop an informed intensive longitudinal research design that enables acquisition of relevant variables across time on a daily basis and across the span of one year; 2) use innovative measurement technologies that enable objective assessment of contextual features related to drinking; 3) collect data using state-of-the-art phone applications that enable self-report and passive data collection where the user does not need to interface; and 4) implement cutting- edge machine learning algorithms that can reliably arrive at individual-level detection and predictive models that can be used as the foundation for future just-in-time adaptive interventions. We will accomplish this by enrolling N=300 young adult risky drinkers who will complete a 120-day ambulatory assessment protocol completing surveys on smartphones that are also equipped with passive sensors and applications, and then provide 4 waves of data on alcohol use and associated variables (e.g., consequences) over one year. In the end, our endeavors will create novel approaches to measuring and modeling behavioral processes related to high-risk drinking that capture the individuality of each participant. These endeavors will provide the framework for accurate detection and prediction of daily drinking and long-term problematic alcohol use trajectories that support future scientific and clinical efforts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Risky drinking behavior (i.e., episodic binge and high-intensity drinking), which peaks in young adulthood, is estimated to account for more than 40,000 deaths annually and over $167 Billion in economic costs in the United States. Young adult risky drinkers are a heterogeneous group, which makes them very difficult to study and to predict who will go on to develop lasting problems with alcohol use and alcohol use disorder. This research will implement cutting-edge machine learning techniques, and apply them to data collected from daily surveys and passive smartphone sensors in young adult risky drinkers to develop personalized models of problematic alcohol use.",Using Smartphone Assessments for Personalized Prediction of Problematic Alcohol Use,10147835,R01AA026879,"['Affect ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' alcohol use disorder ', ' ethanol use disorder ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Behavior ', ' Communities ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Group Meetings ', ' Health ', ' Individuality ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Psychological Models ', ' Psychologic Models ', ' Morbidity -

": Complex systems analysis of the impact of alcohol on bone in non-human primates PROJECT SUMMARY Understanding the impact of alcohol consumption on bone health is important because alcohol influences bone metabolism and over half of the adult population in the United States drinks alcoholic beverages. Low to moderate levels of alcohol consumption are generally associated with beneficial skeletal effects while chronic alcohol abuse predisposes individuals to bone fractures. The long-term goal of our research is to delineate the primary mechanisms mediating the divergent skeletal effects of low/moderate and heavy alcohol consumption. An appreciation of the precise effects and mechanisms of action of alcohol on bone metabolism is important because of the enormous economic, social and personal burden associated with poor bone health. Progress in understanding the actions of alcohol on bone metabolism are hampered by (1) the extreme difficulty in performing intervention studies in humans, (2) limitations of commonly used animal models, (3) failure to adequately consider alcohol’s effects on tissue and organ systems that impact bone, and (4) difficulty in accurately replicating human drinking behavior in animals. The studies proposed in this R01 application will overcome limitations of human and prior animal studies by using a non-human primate (monkey) model for voluntary alcohol consumption that mimics the full range of human drinking behavior. We will use linear regression models, multivariate linear regression models, machine learning, and systems analysis to establish the impact of pattern of alcohol consumption (none, light/moderate, binge, heavy and very heavy) on bone metabolism in rhesus (Macaca mulatta; n=105) and cynomolgus (Macaca fascicularis; n=86) macaques in the context of sex, age and alcohol-induced perturbations in tissue and organ systems that can influence bone. We will identify the latter perturbations by determining the effect of alcohol on specific protein (e.g., peptide hormones and cytokines) and small molecule (e.g., steroid hormones) effectors in blood. Our central hypothesis, based in part on our preliminary data in rats, macaques and humans, is that changes in the blood levels of bone-active hormones and cytokines, derived from several tissues/organs, in response to alcohol intake act in concert to modulate bone cell number and activity. To test our hypothesis, we propose the following two Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: Define the correlative relationships between the quantity and pattern of alcohol consumption and bone in male and female macaques. Specific Aim 2: Define the correlative relationships among blood ethanol levels, key bone active hormones and cytokines, and biochemical markers of bone turnover in male and female macaques. At the completion of this project, we expect to have established that the magnitude of skeletal response to alcohol will correlate with changes in serum biochemical markers of bone turnover which, in turn, will correlate with changes in circulating levels of specific hormones and cytokines. The primary positive impact of our anticipated findings is identification of key underlying factors responsible for the complex, context-dependent actions of alcohol on bone metabolism. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alcohol is an important nonessential component of diet that has been implicated in having both positive and negative effects on the skeleton. The proposed studies will evaluate the impact of pattern of alcohol consumption (none, light/moderate, binge, heavy, and very heavy) on bone in a non-human primate model for voluntary drinking that mimics the full range of human drinking behavior.

"Connectome-based prediction and neurodevelopmental trajectories of alcohol phenotypes across development Abstract Alcohol initiation at an early age is associated with numerous negative outcomes, including a significant increase in the risk of developing an alcohol-use disorder later in life. Vulnerability for early misuse and other problematic alcohol use behaviors have been linked to individual differences in brain function. However, few studies have sought to identify brain-based predictors (‘neuromarkers’) of alcohol use behaviors in youth. Identification of brain-based predictors of alcohol use behaviors in youth is essential for the development of more effective early prevention and intervention efforts. This proposal combines machine learning and longitudinal modeling approaches to 1) identify neural networks predictive of early alcohol initiation and misuse and 2) chart the developmental trajectories of these networks over time in a large sample of youth (N>3,000) using data from three unique, proprietary and completed datasets. Neural networks conferring vulnerability for alcohol use behaviors during adolescence will be identified using connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM). CPM is a machine-learning method of generating behavioral predictions from individual patterns of brain organization; i.e., functional connectivity matrices. Unlike traditional machine learning approaches, CPM is entirely data-driven and requires no a priori selection of brain regions or networks. As such, CPM is both a predictive tool and a method of identifying networks that underlie specific behaviors; i.e., neuromarkers. CPM has been successfully used to predict complex behaviors including future abstinence and other addiction-relevant phenotypes. This proposal will use CPM to identify neuromarkers of alcohol initiation and predict transitions to risky drinking in youth (AIM 1). Quantification of changes in brain function, e.g., growth curve trajectory analysis, is central to the characterization of developmental phenomena. Analyses of developmental trajectories can be used to identify particularly sensitive growth periods, detect variations that may signal risk, define modifiable targets, and monitor the impact of environment and interventions on development. While extant data indicate alcohol-related alterations in neural development, very few studies have assessed interactions between neurodevelopmental trajectories over time and alcohol-use behaviors. Developmental trajectories of identified networks in relation to alcohol use behaviors over time will be assessed using multilevel modeling (AIM 2). This proposal represents the first attempt to identify neural networks predictive of alcohol-initiation and risky drinking using a wholly data- driven, machine learning approach in a large sample of youth and does so using existing data. This is a critical step toward identifying a reliable predictor of alcohol initiation in youth and will shed light on individual difference factors representing vulnerability for misuse. Such predictors are needed to understand the developmental trajectories of alcohol phenotypes and to inform early risk models and preventative intervention efforts. Project Narrative: Alcohol is the most commonly used substance in youth, and earlier ages of alcohol initiation are associated with increased likelihoods of alcohol-use disorder later in life. This project will identify brain networks that predict alcohol initiation and misuse—and chart the developmental trajectories of those networks over time— using existing neuroimaging data from three unique longitudinal datasets (N>3,000).

Many individuals engaging in excessive alcohol consumption do not make it to treatment until it has had large, sometimes catastrophic, negative effects on their life. Mobile phone apps and social media, with care taken for consent and privacy, offer an avenue for large-scale behavior-based study within an ecological context. This proposal seeks to develop techniques for the study of and prediction of unhealthy alcohol consumption within the real-world context of the restaurant industry, a population where excessive alcohol consumption is highly prevalent. Using innovative and rigorous data science techniques, we will study the cross-sectional, prospective longitudinal, and community-based relationships between unhealthy drinking and (a) affective states, (b) stress, and (c) two types of empathy: depleting and beneficial. In the process we will: (1) build a large and secure registry of digital mobile data (N = 5,925) about drinking behavior, (2) evaluate existing data-driven assessments of psychological states, (3) use machine learning to improve assessments of psychological states and predict future drinking behavior, and (4) perform one of the largest scale studies, to date, of the relationship between psychological state and unhealthy drinking. Our specific aims include: (1) Automatically assess the association of unhealthy alcohol consumption with affect, stress, and empathy among restaurant industry workers based on their linguistic behavior in social media and text messaging; (2) Develop a mobile app for longitudinal collection of fine-grained daily psychological health to analyze relation to and build prospective predictive models of daily drinking patterns; (3) Examine community affect, stress, empathy, and open-vocabulary factors, as represented by millions of local posts on public social media and assess their relationship to individual drinking behavior for restaurant industry workers. Each aim includes both the development of computational research tools and the testing of specific hypotheses. Constructs range from those with an extensive literature with respect to unhealthy drinking (emotional states), to those with burgeoning and conflicting research (stress), to those that are highly novel (empathy). We have extensive experience in collecting data and developing apps, including preliminary work at recruiting bartenders and servers. Related research and our preliminary work already suggests that there are strong links between unhealthy drinking and digital language data. We will release our software tools -- the app platform and predictive models -- under open source licenses accompanied with instructional tutorials. We see this work as trail-blazing a broad use-case for data scientific language-based assessments to study unhealthy drinking. Narrative  Unhealthy alcohol consumption is ecological, embedded within people’s everyday lives, but it is difficult to study individuals outside of laboratories and treatment offices. Focused on bartenders and servers, an at risk population, we will use innovative and rigorous data science techniques over mobile and social media data to study the cross-sectional, prospective longitudinal, and community-based relationships between unhealthy drinking and (a) affective states, (b) stress, and (c) empathy.

"Developing a mobile alcohol biosensor platform for use in medication testing research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This mentored patient-oriented research career development award (K23) will enable Dr. Roberts to achieve his long-term career goal of becoming an independent clinical researcher working to develop pharmacotherapies for alcohol use disorder (AUD). This proposal outlines a 5-year training plan that supports a research program focused on developing a mobile biosensor platform for tracking medication effects on alcohol reactivity in ambulating outpatients. Training domains include 1) mobile biosensor assessment of alcohol use, 2) management and analysis of biosensor data, and 3) AUD pharmacotherapy development research. The training plan includes a strategic combination of mentor-led trainings; coursework in mobile health sensing, data science, statistics, bioethics, clinical research methods, and grant writing; attendance at relevant conferences and workshops; and collaboration with investigators conducting research in AUD pharmacotherapy development. The candidate will complete these training activities while completing a research program aimed at developing a mobile biosensor platform that can passively track alcohol consumption and deliver conditional assessments at key points during drinking episodes. In these preliminary studies, heavy drinkers with AUD will wear the mobile biosensors and receive alcohol in the laboratory. In Experiment 1, participants will receive two fixed doses of alcohol while wearing the biosensors and responding to prompted assessments. Goals of this experiment will be to 1) refine the machine-learning derived detection algorithms that will identify key points during drinking episodes and 2) evaluate the user experience and feasibility of delivering prompted assessments on a smartphone during drinking episodes. Experiment 2 will test the detection algorithms in a separate sample of freely behaving participants engaged in self-paced alcohol drinking. Results of these studies will serve as pilot data to support an R-mechanism application to develop a formal paradigm using the biosensor platform to track medication effects of alcohol use and reactivity in ambulating outpatients. Dr. Roberts has assembled an mentorship committee of leaders in the field. Dr. McKee (primary mentor) is a Professor of Psychiatry at the Yale University. She applies innovative laboratory paradigms to AUD pharmacotherapy development research, and she has several lines of research using mobile health biosensors to track substance use behavior. Dr. Ramchandani (primary co-mentor) is a clinical investigator and Chief of the Human Psychopharmacology Section at the NIAAA intramural research program. He will lead Dr. Roberts's training in alcohol pharmacokinetics. Drs. Gueorguieva, Petrakis, and Gerstein will serve as secondary mentors and contribute to Dr. Roberts's training in longitudinal data analysis, AUD pharmacotherapy clinical trials, and machine learning and data science, respectively. Drs. Miranda and Barnett will serve as external advisers and support Dr. Roberts's training in ambulatory assessment in the context of medication development research and transdermal alcohol detection, respectively.

"Open bar assay: A novel operant paradigm for examining motivated response and substance abuse in Drosophila melanogaster PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Individual variation in alcohol preference and self-administration facilitates compulsive alcohol seeking behavior. However, the circuit identity and function underlying individual variability in alcohol self-administration behaviors is still not well understood. The goal of this proposal is to identify subtle behavioral features, fundamental circuitry principles and neurophysiological dynamics underlying alcohol preference in the tractable model system Drosophila melanogaster. Aim 1 will employ a computer vision and machine learning approach to identify subtle behaviors that relate to alcohol preference and alcohol avoidance. In this Aim I hypothesize that animals that express alcohol preference display enhanced seeking behavior, in particular in response to alcohol self- administration whereas lower alcohol preference will manifest through avoidance and reduced locomotion. Aim 2 will employ thermogenetic inactivation, using the GAL4/UAS system, of learning and memory brain circuits we believe play a direct role in encoding alcohol preference. In this Aim I hypothesize that inactivation of our identified learning and memory brain circuits will directly suppress the expression of alcohol preference in flies. Aim 3 will investigate how the neurophysiological dynamics of our identified circuit differs between alcohol preferers and abstainers. I hypothesize that, in my identified circuit, alcohol exposure will result in robust neurophysiological responses in alcohol-preferers and that we will observe the opposite in alcohol abstainers. This work will provide a framework for predicting general circuit principles for escalation of alcohol self- administration in more complex brains, which is in alignment with NIAAA’s mission to support behavioral research on the causes of alcoholism and alcohol-related problems. PROJECT NARRATIVE Innate drug preference has a direct impact on reward- and addiction-related behaviors, and yet how innate drug preference manifests is not well characterized. Here I will examine the behavioral, circuit and neurophysiological mechanisms underlying alcohol preference.

"Estimating BrAC/BAC from Transdermal Alcohol: Combining First-Principles Physiological Models with Machine-Learning to Create Software to Optimally Process and Quantitatively Interpret Biosensor Data Abstract Transdermal alcohol biosensors offer a promising method for unobtrusively collecting continuous alcohol levels in naturalistic settings over long periods of time. Devices are now available to reliably measure transdermal alcohol concentration (TAC), the amount of alcohol diffusing through the skin, but an often overlooked yet critical issue for making these biosensors valuable is that TAC does not consistently correlate with the easily interpretable measures of breath and blood alcohol concentrations (BrAC/BAC) across individuals, environmental conditions, and devices. The goal of this study is to produce software to convert TAC data into estimates of BrAC/BAC (eBrAC/eBAC). We will meet this goal by 1) developing mathematical models to produce quantitative eBrAC from TAC data, 2) examining alternative options for calibrating these models, 3) testing the model fits using varied types and amounts of very precise data, and 4) packaging the models into a comprehensive data assimilation software program. Specifically, we will enhance the fidelity of the models by integrating advanced physics/physiological-based models with statistical methods and data-driven machine- learning techniques. To reduce the burden currently required to calibrate the models for each individual, we will test a number of calibration procedures, including the replacement of the laboratory alcohol administration session with more varied drinking protocols as well as with population-based parameter estimates. We will test our models and protocols using detailed consumption data collected 1) on two of the investigators, 2) on 40 participants who will each participate in four controlled laboratory drinking sessions, and 3) on 40 participants who will each participate in a field trial and laboratory sessions. We will examine model fits across drinking patterns when using varying amounts of individualized alcohol data (e.g., breath analyzer, drink diary) to calibrate the models, and within and across individuals with differing characteristics (e.g., gender, weight) and under variable conditions (e.g., humidity, heart rate) that may affect model fit. We will create a data assimilation software system, the BrAC Estimator software, that incorporates all available data to produce the most accurate eBrAC measures. The software output will include the identification of drinking episodes, continuous eBrAC signal, and eBrAC summary scores (e.g., peak eBrAC, time of peak eBrAC, area under the drinking curve) with confidence bands. The software will be platform-portable to run alone or to be integrated into other mobile health technologies or precision medicine protocols. This proposal is innovative, technologically sophisticated, and feasible, and would result in the first tool to accomplish the TAC-eBrAC conversion, finally making it possible to obtain interpretable quantitative measurement of naturalistic alcohol consumption in the field. The anticipated result of this study is the expanded utility of TAC biosensors for researchers, clinicians, and individuals to monitor naturalistic alcohol consumption and easily understand the results. Narrative This research program will advance mathematical models and methodological techniques to make it possible to obtain quantitative estimates of breath and blood alcohol concentration levels from the data produced by transdermal alcohol sensors. By making these methodological advancements available in software programs for use by non-mathematicians, the proposed study has the capability of widely enhancing the alcohol research community’s ability to investigate a variety of alcohol-related research topics that cannot be captured retrospectively or in laboratory settings, including naturalistic patterns of consumption, individual differences in response to alcohol, real-time drinking behavior and decisions, clinical intervention outcomes, and the prevention and treatment of alcoholism. More broadly, the software can be integrated with personal health monitoring systems for general public use and provide easily interpreted personalized alcohol consumption feedback.",Estimating BrAC/BAC from Transdermal Alcohol: Combining First-Principles Physiological Models with Machine-Learning to Create Software to Optimally Process and Quantitatively Interpret Biosensor Data,10132950,R01AA026368,"['Affect ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Calibration ', ' Communities ', ' Feedback ', ' Galvanic Skin Response ', ' Electrodermal Response ', ' Psychogalvanic Reflex ', ' Skin Electric Conductance ', ' skin conductance ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Humidity ', ' Laboratories ', ' Linear Models ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Physics ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Running ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Temperature ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Assimilations ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' alcohol measurement ', ' ETOH level ', ' alcohol level ', ' ethanol measurement ', ' ethyl alcohol measurements ', ' breath alcohol measurement ', ' BrAC ', ' alcohol breath analysis ', ' assay of breath alcohol ', ' assay of breath ethanol ', ' breath alcohol concentration ', ' breath alcohol test ', ' breath ethanol concentration ', ' breath ethanol measurement ', ' breath ethanol test ', ' ethanol breath analysis ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Series ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' diaries ', ' Area Under Curve ', ' programs ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Blood Alcohol Content ', ' blood alcohol concentration ', ' blood alcohol level ', ' Blood alcohol level measurement ', ' biological sensor ', ' Biosensor ', ' Participant ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' drinking ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' time interval ', ' portability ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' BAC clone ', ' BACs ', ' Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes ', ' alcohol addiction therapy ', ' alcohol dependence therapy ', ' alcoholism treatment ', ' alcoholism therapy ', ' Skin ', ' Address ', ' Concentration measurement ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Output ', ' time use ', ' physiologic model ', ' software systems ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' drinking behavior ', ' Individual Differences ', ' National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism ', ' NIAAA ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Plug-in ', ' alcohol research ', ' alcohol related research ', ' ethanol research ', ' alcohol response ', ' ethanol response ', ' response to alcohol ', ' response to ethanol ', ' population based ', ' data reduction ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' mathematical methods ', ' math methodology ', ' math methods ', ' mathematical approach ', ' mathematical methodology ', ' mathematics approach ', ' mathematics methodology ', ' mathematics methods ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' ']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2021,500906,CA-37
"Bringing real-time stress detection to scale: Development of a biosensor driven, stress detection classifier for smartwatches PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goals of this mentored, patient-oriented, research career development award are two-fold: 1) Characterize the autonomic nervous system correlates of stress-reactivity, both in laboratory and ambulatory contexts in order to inform the development of a biosensor driven, stress-detection classifier algorithm that can run on commercially available smartwatches, and 2) establish the principal investigator as an independent researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital - Harvard Medical School. The specific aims of this research will be accomplished through an innovative study leveraging the strengths of traditional laboratory-based, psychophysiological research, and cutting-edge, in natura monitoring of stress and stress’ autonomic correlates using a combination of ecological momentary assessment of affect, and ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring. This research will inform the development of a stress-detection algorithm that will run on commercially available smartwatches. The clinical and health applications for real-time stress detection are numerous, but this technology holds particular promise for individuals in early recovery from alcohol use disorder for whom unchecked stress heightens risk for alcohol use and engagement in other maladaptive coping behaviors. The smartwatch-embedded stress detection algorithm developed in this research will ultimately be linked to existing smartphone-based relapse prevention apps that will prompt patients with real-time coaching to mitigate alcohol use risk. Aims of the principal investigator’s career development and training plan include, 1) learning fundamental principles of machine learning with an emphasis on biosensor technologies, 2) gaining facility with Matlab programming, with an emphasis on signal analysis and psychophysiological model building, 3) broadening expertise in cardiovascular waveform and interval analysis with particular emphasis on artefact management, and 4) acquiring skills in the development and application of mHealth-based clinical interventions. These goals will be achieved through a training plan comprised of mentorship, formal coursework, seminars, conferences, and manuscript preparation. Knowledge gained via the training plan will be augmented by the research undertaken. Drs. John Kelly, Paolo Bonato, Gari Clifford, and Bettina Hoeppner will serve as mentors on this award, and will provide targeted expertise in machine learning approaches, Matlab programing, artefact management, and mHealth treatment development. Massachusetts General Hospital - Harvard Medical School provides an exceptional environment in which to conduct this training and research. By the end of the 5-year award period, the goals are to have a working stress-detection classifier algorithm ready for R01 testing, and for the principal investigator to be established as an independent investigator. This award is consistent with NIH's goal of increasing and maintaining a strong cohort of investigators to address the nation's clinical research needs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alcohol use disorder carries tremendous personal and societal costs, and in spite of best clinical efforts, this disorder is characterized by very high relapse rates following treatment. There is a pressing need for novel interventions that prevent alcohol use relapse, and help individuals achieve sustained remission. This study will develop the algorithms that will enable the biosensors embedded in commercially available smartwatches to detect stress in real time using physiological measures of autonomic arousal, which will ultimately be used to trigger smartphone relapse prevention apps to prompt patients with real-time coaching to mitigate alcohol use relapse risk.","Bringing real-time stress detection to

"Toward a Generalized Framework and Flexible Software Environment for Power Analysis of Alcohol Treatment Randomized Controlled Trials PROJECT SUMMARY Pharmacological and behavioral treatments of alcohol use disorder are only useful to the extent that their effects are robust and reliable. A priori determination of statistical power is one of the most significant steps to maximizing scientific reliability; however, it has historically been largely overlooked in the health sciences. Alcohol researchers are increasingly utilizing complex statistical models (e.g., growth curves, mixture models, social networks); yet, accessible methods for sample size determination for all but the simplest statistical tests have not been broadly disseminated. Moreover, even for models in which software programs are readily available, scientists consistently express uncertainty regarding expected parameter estimates, prohibiting the utility of power analysis itself. As a result, many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are likely not optimally designed to allow for conclusive statistical inference. The overall objective of this proposal is to close this gap by developing a generalized method for power analysis using a combination of established and innovative approaches that can be used to generate and test a vast array of models used in treatment research. This objective will be achieved by pursuing two specific aims: develop a flexible, user-friendly software interface for statistical power and sensitivity analysis (Aim 1); and develop a generalized framework for determining model parameter estimates (Aim 2). The proposal is innovative because the software interface will be grounded in state-of-the-art advancements in computational technology and human-computer interaction. In addition, the framework will be fortified by advances in generalizability-theory-based meta-analyses and guided walk and machine-learning-based simulation studies investigating the effects of uncertainty in individual model parameters on the likelihood of observing hypothesized effects. The software will include automated sensitivity analyses to identify parameters with the largest impact on power and will recommend starting parameters. Development and testing will be grounded in the naltrexone and cognitive behavioral therapy literatures. Their widespread use and diversity of methodological approaches make them ideal testbeds from which to generalize to other treatment domains. This research is synergistic with each of the goals within the NIAAA Strategic Plan (2017-2021). Perhaps most significantly, methodology and guidelines will be developed for designing RCTs that have sufficient precision to distinguish trajectories, mechanisms, heterogeneity, and specificity of treatment efficacy. These efforts will provide researchers with the required a priori information to execute studies that ensure the robustness of their results. The development of these tools for RCT design will have implications for all areas of alcohol treatment research, including in-the-moment risk behaviors, person- level (comorbid) characteristics, targeting underserved and vulnerable populations, and large-scale initiatives. As a result, this proposal will allow for more definitive identification of efficacious interventions and treatments of alcohol use disorder. PROJECT NARRATIVE NIH-funded research is critical to addressing the nearly 44% lifetime prevalence of alcohol use disorder and reducing the $224 billion in annual preventable costs associated with drinking; thus, it is imperative that conclusions drawn from alcohol treatment research be robust and reliable. A priori determination of statistical power is one of the most significant steps in maximizing valid statistical inferences; yet, it has been historically overlooked in the health sciences and few tools exist for ensuring its accurate estimation. This proposal will develop a generalized framework for determining starting parameters and a flexible and user-friendly software platform for conducting power analyses of a wide range of study designs utilized by alcohol treatment researchers, thereby improving the rigor, reproducibility, and transparency of health science research and enhancing the scientific integrity of clinical and public health initiatives based on such findings.",Toward a Generalized Framework and Flexible Software Environment for Power Analysis of Alcohol Treatment Randomized Controlled Trials,10240574,R01AA027264,"['alcohol use disorder ', ' ethanol use disorder ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Influentials ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Naltrexone ', ' Nalorex ', ' Nemexin ', ' ReVia ', ' Vivitrol ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Peer Review ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Public Health ', ' Reproducibility of Results ', ' Reproducibility of Findings ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Walking ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Social Network ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' computer human interaction ', ' man-machine interaction ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Family Study ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Non-linear Models ', ' Nonlinear Models ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' journal article ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' health science research ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' user friendly computer software ', ' user friendly software ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' drinking ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' alcohol abuse treatment ', ' alcohol treatment ', ' alcohol abuse therapy ', ' model design ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Pharmacological Treatment ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' treatment trial ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' Underserved Population ', ' under served group ', ' under served people ', ' under served population ', ' underserved group ', ' underserved people ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism ', ' NIAAA ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' treatment effect ', ' user-friendly ', ' user centered design ', ' usability ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' tool development ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' trial design ', ' simulation game ', ' simulation-based learning ', ' power analysis ', ' open data ', ' open science ', ' open-source data ', ' web app ', ' web application ', ' online registry ', ' randomized controlled design ', ' treatment research ', ' efficacious intervention ', ' efficacious treatment ', ' efficacious therapy ', ' ']",NIAAA,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,671748,IN-04
