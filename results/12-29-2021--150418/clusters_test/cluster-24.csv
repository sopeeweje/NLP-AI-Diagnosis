"Improving Outcomes for Care Partners of Persons with Traumatic Brain Injury Abstract Care partners of persons with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) are often required to assume a caregiver role, bearing primary responsibility for assisting the person with TBI in physical, mental, financial, and leisure activities. As a result of these new caregiving responsibilities, it is common for these care partners to report problems with physical, mental, and social health, as well as compromised health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Given that care partners’ well-being and functioning affects both their own personal health outcomes, as well as the functional and rehabilitation outcomes of the person with TBI, there is a critical need to develop novel health management interventions to ensure better health outcomes for both members of the TBI care partnership dyad. Therefore, our long-term goal is to improve the health and well-being of these care partners, as well as their ability to provide care to their loved one. Thus, the proposed randomized control trial will examine the efficacy of a just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI), or personalized self-management intervention that uses objective mobile sensor data feedback to improve physical activity, sleep, and HRQOL in 240 care partners of persons with TBI. Our primary objectives are to: 1) assess the efficacy of this novel personalized self-management intervention (i.e., JITAI) for preventing the development of adverse symptoms (e.g., mobility, sleep, poor HRQOL); and 2) use data collected from wearables (i.e., the Fitbit Charge®) and real-time assessments of HRQOL to identify care partners with the greatest risk for negative physical and mental HRQOL outcomes, as well as the timing for when they are at greatest risk. We expect care partners that are randomized to receive the JITAI will demonstrate improvements in HRQOL, physical activity and sleep relative to controls. We also hypothesize is that objective, data-derived mobile phenotypes can predict risk for adverse caregiver HRQOL. The scientific premise for the proposed research is based on our multidisciplinary team with expertise in caregiver research, evaluation of HRQOL using patient-reported outcomes, clinical trials implementation, expertise in real time assessment of HRQOL, as well as the statistical expertise in high- dimensional statistics and machine learning. Furthermore, the innovation is grounded in the examination of a real-time, real-world, personalized and scalable JITAI designed to improve HRQOL in care partners. Ultimately, this study will allow us to identify care partners at the greatest risk for negative physical and mental health outcomes, and will provide important efficacy data to support the clinical utility of a low cost, low burden self-management intervention to improve HRQOL for care partners of persons with TBI. Narrative Care partners of persons with traumatic brain injury (TBI) are often faced with considerable physical and emotional stress resulting from their caregiver role; not surprisingly, this stress is associated with negative physical and mental health outcomes for both the care partner and the person for whom they provide care. Given this, interventions focused on improving the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of these care partners will likely have positive downstream effects for the care recipient. The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of a personalized self-management intervention designed to promote care partner self-care; this intervention uses physical activity and sleep data collected using a Fitbit® and real-time self-reports of HRQOL collected via a mobile phone app, to provide care partners with personalized feedback via app alert four times per week.",Improving Outcomes for Care Partners of Persons with Traumatic Brain Injury,10110031,R01NR013658,"['Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Beds ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Charge ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Data Collection ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Family ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Feedback ', ' Financial Activity ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Priorities ', ' Heart ', ' Leisure Activities ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Persons ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Measures ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Phenotype ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Sleep ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' aberrant sleep ', ' disrupted sleep ', ' disturbed sleep ', ' impaired sleep ', ' irregular sleep ', ' sleep disruption ', ' sleep dysregulation ', ' statistics ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' smoking cessation ', ' cease smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' stop smoking ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Emotional Stress ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Self Management ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Physical assessment ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Research Priority ', ' Life ', ' Hour ', ' System ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Physical Function ', ' Rehabilitation Outcome ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Nursing Research ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Request for Applications ', ' NIH RFA ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' post intervention ', ' tv watching ', ' screen time ', ' television watching ', ' caregiving ', ' care giving ', ' cost ', ' health related quality of life ', ' care systems ', ' care services ', ' Social Functioning ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' efficacy evaluation ', ' efficacy analysis ', ' efficacy assessment ', ' efficacy examination ', ' evaluate efficacy ', ' examine efficacy ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' loved ones ', ' control trial ', ' group intervention ', ' care recipients ', ' care receiver ', ' caregiver strain ', ' care giver strain ', ' Accelerometer ', ' accelerometry ', ' activity monitor ', ' activity tracker ', ' Caregiver research ', ' Care giver research ', ' improved outcome ', ' fitbit ', ' high dimensionality ', ' health management ', ' health care management ', ' healthcare management ', ' care outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health assessment ', ' sleep health ', ' sleep hygiene ', ' adaptive intervention ', ' poor sleep ', ' clinical trial implementation ', ' implementation of clinical trials ', ' Home ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,592501,MI-12
"Assisted Identification and Navigation of Early Mental Health Symptoms in Children ABSTRACT About 55% of children with significant mental health difficulties receive treatment and up to 80% of children with sub-clinical symptoms receive no treatment. Treatments are often not initiated until issues are significantly impacting the child and family. This study aims to conduct a pragmatic randomized trial in two non-academic health care systems to test a mental health family navigator model to promote early access to, engagement in, and coordination of needed mental health services for children. The first task of the study will focus on the implementation of a predictive model to identify symptomatic children with no diagnosed mental health disorder(s) or treatments initiated. The tool identifies patients with documentation of mental health symptoms or complaints in the free text of a progress note from a recent primary care or urgent care visit. Using this predictive algorithm, we will conduct a pragmatic randomized trial comparing intervention and usual care arm patients enrolled from Kaiser Permanente (KP) Washington and KP Northern California. The trial will enroll 200 patients per arm (n=400). Children with (1) a new mental health diagnosis but no treatment initiated; (2) a new mental health medication ordered with no mental health diagnosis; and (3) symptoms identified by the predictive model with no new mental health diagnosis or treatment initiated will be recruited. The study intervention will offer 6 months of support to the family by a mental health navigator (social worker). The navigator will perform an initial needs and barriers assessment with the family around mental health services, conduct ongoing motivational interviewing around mental health care, provide up to 4 psychotherapy sessions (when appropriate) via clinic-to-home video visits, help the family find and schedule with appropriate mental health providers in the community, and reach out ad hoc if mental health appointments or medication refills are missed. The primary outcome is the percentage of youth initiating psychotherapy. The secondary outcome is the percentage of youth with at least 4 mental health visits. We hypothesize that the intervention arm will have higher rates of psychotherapy use compared to the control arm. We will also assess initiation of psychotropic medications. All primary analyses will follow an intent-to-treat approach. A waiver of consent will be obtained to include data for all individuals offered the intervention in the analysis, regardless of the amount of intervention (“dose” of navigation) received. NARRATIVE Mental illnesses often first appear in childhood and yet go mostly untreated until a serious disorder develops. This study will (a) implement ways to identify early mental health needs in children 4-12 years of age using free text notes entered into medical records, and (b) carry out a two-arm randomized trial to test if offering navigator support and video-based psychotherapy result in more mental health visits over a 6-month period of time.",Assisted Identification and Navigation of Early Mental Health

"Positive valence systems engagement during social reward exposure psychotherapy for mid- and late-life depression PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT  The proposed K23 Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award is designed to provide the candidate with the conceptual knowledge and technical skills needed for a career of an independent investigator focused on the engagement of behavioral and neural network targets during personalized psychotherapies for mid- and late depression. The candidate will conduct her training and research activities at the ALACRITY Center of the Weill Cornell Institute of Geriatric Psychiatry.  The proposal is based on the premise that identifying specific behavioral and neural network targets can guide development of streamlined interventions with potential for broad scalability and reach. “Engage”, a streamlined therapy for late-life depression, whose principal intervention is “reward exposure”, may change Positive Valence Systems (PVS) functions. Preliminary studies by the candidate show that early increase in resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) of PVS structures during “Engage” predicts increased behavioral activation. Additionally, compared to solitary pleasant activities, exposure to rewarding social interactions during “Engage” leads to greater increase in behavioral activation and reduction of depression severity. Finally, a machine learning analysis conducted by the candidate showed that low perceived social support is the strongest predictor of poor response early in psychotherapy. These findings are in line with animal and human studies demonstrating the protective role of social rewards. Based on these observations, the candidate developed “Engage-S”, a social-reward based version of “Engage”, aimed to increase exposure to meaningful social interactions with others.  The training study proposes to examine whether social reward exposure in “Engage-S” enhances PVS abnormalities and improves mid- and late-life depression. The participants will be 60 middle-aged and older adults (age ≥ 50) with major depression who will be randomized to 9-weeks of “Engage-S” or to a Symptom Review and Psychoeducation (SRP) comparison condition. During treatment, we will examine target engagement of the PVS with rsFC, a behavioral activation scale (BADS), and performance on a novel social reward paradigm at baseline, 5 weeks, and 9 weeks. We will use computational methods to identify neuroimaging and behavioral profiles associated with treatment response.  The training plan consists of formal courses, structured tutorials, and hands-on methodological training that will offer the candidate knowledge and skills in: 1) Functional neuroanatomy of depression and aging; 2) Use of fMRI to assess target engagement during psychotherapies for mid- and late-life depression; 3) Computational modeling for the identification of clinical and neuroimaging predictors of treatment response that can be used to personalize psychotherapy; and 4) Generate preliminary data for an R-series experimental therapeutics target engagement application. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Abnormalities in the Positive Valence System (PVS) are associated with depressive symptoms and reduced behavioral activation in mid- and late-life. This study will investigate the engagement of the PVS during exposure to social rewards, part of a novel streamlined psychotherapy for mid- and late-life depression. Use of computational modeling will enable identification of neuroimaging and behavioral profiles associated with greater treatment response, and may guide future personalization of psychotherapy.",Positive valence systems engagement during social reward exposure psychotherapy for mid- and late-life depression,10191051,K23MH123864,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Animals ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Cues ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Future ', ' Geriatric Psychiatry ', ' Psychiatry for older adults ', ' Psychiatry for older people ', ' Psychiatry for seniors ', ' Psychiatry for the elderly ', ' Psychogeriatrics ', ' geriatric psychology ', ' geropsychiatry ', ' geropsychology ', ' geropsychopharmacology ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutes ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methodology ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Neuroanatomy ', ' Neuranatomies ', ' Neuranatomy ', ' Neuroanatomies ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rest ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Testing ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Generations ', ' Technical Expertise ', ' technical skills ', ' Addictive Behavior ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Research Activity ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Severities ', ' System ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' psychoeducation ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' patient oriented study ', ' patient oriented research ', ' Experimental Therapies ', ' Investigational Treatments ', ' experimental therapeutic agents ', ' experimental therapeutics ', ' Investigational Therapies ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict treatment response ', ' therapy prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' geriatric depression ', ' Elderly depression ', ' late life depression ', ' reward circuitry ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' improved functioning ', ' geriatric major depression ', ' late life major depression ', ' therapeutic target ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' biosignature ', ' financial incentive ', ' financial reward ', ' monetary incentive ', ' Positive Valence ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' neural network ', ' random forest ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,K23,2021,191063,NY-12
"Predictive modeling of peripartum depression ABSTRACT Psychiatric problems surrounding parturition affect both the mother’s health and her child’s developmental trajectory. Peripartum depression (PPD), referring to a depressive episode occurring during pregnancy or after childbirth, is both common and morbid. PPD has been implicated in various short and long term adverse outcomes, including preterm delivery and heightened risk for mental illness in the adult offspring. In extreme cases, PPD can lead to maternal suicide and/or infanticide. Although an estimated 760,000 American women (and children) suffer from PPD each year and screening for PPD has been recommended by the USPTF, no accurate screening tool is available to adequately identify women at risk of PPD. This novel study will capitalize on the rich clinical, demographic, and laboratory information in patients’ electronic medical reports (EMRs) to improve screening for PPD. We propose to implement advanced machine learning methods to build a model to optimize identification of women at risk for PPD. We we will adopt a psycho-social- biological approach of mental illness to prospectively explore the combined effect of various disease-related factors in improving the accuracy of PPD prediction. Our dataset will make use of a sample of 20,000 women who have been followed during their obstetrical care in two leading academic hospitals in Boston. We will gather information concerning socioeconomic factors, relevant obstetric factors, and mental and physical conditions in pregnancy and disease history, as derived from laboratory test results and the patient’s report. We expect our findings to advance scientific knowledge of women at risk for PPD. Our work may lead to the development of a screening protocol that is low-cost and easily performed by health providers in clinical settings. Early identification of women at risk could potentially allow targeted interventions to reduce the prevalence and morbidity of PPD in the US. This in turn could reduce treatment costs, avoid a potentially preventable disease, and improve the quality of care and health outcomes of mothers and their children. Our study accords with the NICD high priority area of research aimed at improving the health of women during and after pregnancy and improving pregnancy outcomes. The proposed project will further the NICHD mission that women suffer no harmful effects from reproductive processes, and that children achieve healthy and productive lives. PROJECT NARRATIVE Peripartum depression (PDD) referring to the occurrence of depressive episode during pregnancy or following childbirth is a common and serious illness. While the US Preventive Services Task Force recommends universal screening for PPD, there is no accurate tool to predict women who would be at risk of suffering from PPD. The goal of this study is to test a machine learning predictive model of PPD using information in patients’ medical records to decrease PPD’s prevalence and ultimately prevent it.",Predictive modeling of peripartum depression,10131234,R03HD101724,"['Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Boston ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Child Development ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitals ', ' Infanticide ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity -

"Developing a Data-Driven Management System Using Machine Learning and Mixed-Methods Research to Predict Job Turnover Among MentalHealth Professionals Project Summary/Abstract The main goal of this study is to build a data-driven, evidence-based organizational management system that can inform effective recruitment and retention strategies to prevent excessive turnover. High turnover rates (estimated 25-60% annually) are devastating for mental health care systems, affecting organizations (e.g., cost), employees (e.g., work well-being), and most critically, the quality of care. Human resource departments collect extensive employee data that can be useful predictors for turnover, but these data are not often analyzed to address turnover issues in mental health organizations. Computational methods have greatly evolved and can now access and analyze large and complex data. This pilot study will achieve three specific aims: Aim 1: build and test turnover prediction models by developing and applying machine learning algorithms to existing human resource data; Aim 2: generate critical questions to enhance turnover prediction through qualitative methods; and Aim 3: test the enhanced model in predicting turnover at 12 months. In Aim 1, using past human resource data and service encounters from [two mental health organizations (rural and urban locations)], we will develop machine learning algorithms to predict turnover. The algorithms will address turnover questions simultaneously (e.g., Who are the most likely to leave? What factors predict turnover at varying time points in employment?). In Aim 2, we will interview key informants: “leavers” (employees who voluntarily terminate employment during the study); “stayers” (employees with extreme longevity in the organization); and “predictees” (identified as likely to leave, based on our algorithms). The findings will be discussed in two focus groups in order to generate, refine, and validate 5-10 critical questions to enhance prediction of turnover. In Aim 3, we will conduct an on-line survey of all current employees to assess the 5-10 critical questions and link survey data with data from human resources and services to examine the improved precision between the theory-based model (predictors in the survey) and the data-driven model (machine learning algorithms) in predicting actual turnover 12 months later. Machine learning can model complex and dynamic variable relationships (e.g., handling a large number of variables, accounting for heterogeneity) and overcome limitations in traditional turnover research that often relies on small, cross-sectional, and convenience samples. Successful completion of this study will promote data-driven, evidence-based organizational management practices to address turnover, which is aligned with NIMH priorities of capitalizing on existing data structures and using technologies to improve mental health service quality. This study will be a critical step in developing highly adaptable machine learning algorithms to predict turnover; ultimately, we envision that this system will be partnered with future clinical interventions to reduce turnover in mental health. Project Narrative This pilot study will build a data-driven, evidence-based organizational management system to inform effective recruitment and retention strategies for preventing excessive employee turnover in mental health organizations. Successful retention of a quality workforce not only helps mental health organizations and their employees, but also directly impacts the quality of care that clients receive. In addition, a data-driven, evidence-based organizational management system could be partnered with clinical interventions to reduce turnover.",Developing a Data-Driven Management System Using Machine Learning and Mixed-Methods Research to Predict Job Turnover Among MentalHealth Professionals,10074594,R34MH119411,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Professional Burnout ', ' Client ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Community Mental Health Centers ', ' CMHC ', ' Computer Systems ', ' computing system ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Sources ', ' Employment ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' services research ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Interview ', ' Investments ', ' Job Satisfaction ', ' Work Satisfaction ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Personnel Turnover ', ' Employee Turnover ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Productivity ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' mental health organization ', ' rural area ', ' rural location ', ' rural region ', ' urban area ', ' urban location ', ' urban region ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Compensation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' burn-out ', ' burnout ', ' Services ', ' human data ', ' Performance ', ' Employee ', ' Practice Management ', ' Structure ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' informant ', ' Health Professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' evidence base ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' retention rate ', ' retention strategy ', ' student retention ', ' data resource ', ' recruit ', ' treatment services ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' heterogenous data ', ' data heterogeneity ', ' data set heterogeneity ', ' dataset heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous data ', ' heterogeneous data sets ', ' heterogeneous datasets ', ' heterogenous data sets ', ' heterogenous datasets ', ' complex data ', ' ']",NIMH,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R34,2021,230630,IN-07
"Automated Mental Health Referral System This proposal addresses a significant barrier to obtaining treatment for college-age  youth with mental disorders. Many college-age youth with impairing mental disorders  remain untreated because of concerns about stigma and privacy, inconvenience and wait times, and  because universities are often unable to service all such students. Also, of critical importance,  when referral for treatment is implemented, it is without regard to the person's pathology,  because of the erroneous assumption that treatment need not be tailored to the  individual. This proposal aims to address this critical clinical issue. We advance that a  sophisticated automated online referral system would resolve all of these problems, but there is no  expert-trained system for psychiatric referrals. We propose to automate the referral process,  designed for college-age youth, by bridging online, mental health assessments and curated,  up-to-date, mental health provider networks. To this end, the non-profit Child Mind  1nstitute is partnering with the for-profit MiResource. Assessment expertise is provided  by the Child Mind Institute, which treats children and adolescents with mental health  disorders, conducts mental health research, has acquired large assessment datasets, has in-house  expertise in mental health assessment, and through its MATTER lab has developed novel assessment  technologies such as the Mindlogger data collection and assessment platform. Referral  infrastructure is provided by MiResource, a software-as-a-service solution designed to help  universities connect students to local mental health providers. The MATTER lab and MiResource  will develop an automated online assessment and referral platform that uses expert-trained  machine learning to provide users with personalized referrals for mental health care.  Expert referrals will be based on the six dimensions of the level of Care Utilization System (risk  of harm, functional status, comorbidity, environment, treatment history, and attitude)  applied to college students' responses to mental health assessments. 1n Phase 1, we will (1-1)  build mental health assessments into the Mindlogger platform, (1-2) build an expert  referral collection interface, and (1-3) set up a machine learning pipeline for training and  testing an updatable classification model for automated clinically appropriate, personalized  referrals. 1n Phase 11, we will build, refine, and clinically validate our  product for commercialization. Specifically, we will (11-1) validate the Phase I framework on a  university population, (11-2) integrate Mindlogger's assessments into MiResource, and (11-3)  conduct usability and quality assurance tests of the new Mindlogger plus MiResource platform,   to get feedback about issues related to accessibility, relevance, accuracy, and esthetics,  and incorporate solutions in response to this feedback into a final version. College-age youth do not have easy access to expert referral coordinators to get  referrals to appropriate mental health care, due to the stigma of seeing a referral coordinator  in-person, long wait times to get an intake appointment in the university counseling center,  or limited or no referral counselors available in their higher-education institution. We  propose to automate the referral process, focusing on college-age youth, by bridging online  assessments and curated, up-to-date mental health provider networks. Our automated online referral  platform will use expert-trained machine learning to provide users with personalized  referrals for mental health care.",Automated Mental Health Referral System,10155997,R42MH125688,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Appointment ', ' Attitude ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Chi-Square Tests ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Counseling ', ' Professional counselor ', ' Counselor ', ' Data Collection ', ' Environment ', ' Esthetics ', ' Feedback ', ' Female ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Health Resources ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutes ', ' Insurance ', ' Learning Disorders ', ' male ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Persons ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Psychiatrist ', ' Psychologist ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Social Workers ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Students ', ' Technology Assessment ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Privacy ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' quality assurance ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' satisfaction ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' Services ', ' success ', ' college student ', ' university student ', ' functional status ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' referral center ', ' biomedical referral center ', ' Provider ', ' Institution ', ' telehealth ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' Collection ', ' Small Business Technology Transfer Research ', ' STTR ', ' Update ', ' Process ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' usability ', ' commercialization ', ' higher education ', ' software as a service ', ' provider networks ', ' Wait Time ', ' health assessment ', ' Infrastructure ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' ']",NIMH,"MIRESOURCE, INC.",R42,2021,147826,CA-18
"Positive Valence System Function and Reward Exposure Therapy for Late-Life Depression Project Summary/Abstract  The goal of the proposed K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award is to provide the PI with the mentorship, theoretical knowledge, and research skills to develop into a fully independent psychophysiological researcher studying biomarkers of depression that can be used as targets for novel interventions. In consultation with her mentors, the PI has recruited a team of expert consultants to guide her in executing a research project and training plan that will provide experience essential to her goals.  The proposed study will be conducted at the ALACRITY Center of the Weill Cornell Institute of Geriatric Psychiatry. The study focuses on late-life depression because it is prevalent and has negative outcomes. Existing treatments have low response rates and are rarely used correctly in the community due to their complexity. The project is based on the premise that focused treatments targeting biosignatures of specific neural abnormalities will have the greatest impact on clinical outcomes in late-life depression. It concentrates on positive valence systems, which are vulnerable to aging and often impaired in depression. The project will investigate positive valence systems in older adults with major depression receiving Engage, a psychotherapy designed to reactivate reward system functions. Engage has been found efficacious in late-life depression and easy to learn by community-based therapists. Consistent with RDoC methods, the proposed study will examine target engagement of Engage in 35 depressed older adults (age ≥ 60) during a 9-week course of Engage therapy, using three units of analysis to assess positive valence system function: physiology (event-related potentials), self-reports, and behavior. It will compare Engage-treated participants with 35 depressed participants, group-matched on age, receiving manualized supportive therapy. Additional analyses will assess whether low baseline positive valence function, or increases in positive valence function during treatment, predict improvement of anhedonia with Engage, and whether reward function mediates change in anhedonia.  The proposed training plan complements the research study with individualized tutorials, formal coursework, research collaborations, and manuscript preparation that will provide the PI with knowledge and skills in several areas: 1) Age-related neurobiological changes in the positive valence system and related networks; 2) Advanced statistical techniques to identify distinct neural abnormalities in depressed individuals based on their ERP profiles; and 3) Clinical trial design for psychotherapeutic interventions. The proposed project may provide important information about target engagement and mechanisms of a biologically informed, easily implemented treatment for late-life depression that has potential for dissemination. It will also provide pilot data for an R-series study using machine learning methods to predict response to Engage and will serve as an important stepping-stone for the PI as she prepares for an independent research career. Late-life depression is prevalent and devastating, and response rates to even the most effective treatments are low. Outcomes may be improved by developing targeted interventions such as Engage – a new, easily disseminated, neurobiologically informed psychotherapy for late-life depression designed to restore impaired function of the positive valence system. The proposed study will use event-related potentials and a panel of other positive valence system measures to assess target engagement in 35 depressed older adults (age ≥ 60) receiving Engage therapy, with a comparison group of 35 age-group-matched depressed peers receiving supportive therapy.",Positive Valence System Function and Reward Exposure Therapy for Late-Life Depression,10194608,K23MH116105,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Consultations ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Feedback ', ' Geriatric Psychiatry ', ' Psychiatry for older adults ', ' Psychiatry for older people ', ' Psychiatry for seniors ', ' Psychiatry for the elderly ', ' Psychogeriatrics ', ' geriatric psychology ', ' geropsychiatry ', ' geropsychology ', ' geropsychopharmacology ', ' Goals ', ' indexing ', ' Institutes ', ' Matched Group ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Physiology ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Time ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Anhedonia ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Collaborations ', ' Event-Related Potentials ', ' event related potential ', ' Supportive Therapy ', ' Supportive care ', ' depressed ', ' sadness ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Knowledge ', ' Severities ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Visual attention ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' trait ', ' Manuscripts ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' research study ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' Ventral Striatum ', ' Emotional ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' K23 Award ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Program ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' Research Training ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Preparation ', ' Behavioral ', ' comparison group ', ' comparator group ', ' geriatric depression ', ' Elderly depression ', ' late life depression ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' self reported behavior ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' extrastriate ', ' Impairment ', ' Affective ', ' reward processing ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' biosignature ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' Positive Valence ', ' sustained attention ', ' learning community ', ' predicting response ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' recruit ', ' opioid user ', ' Opiate user ', ' Opioid drug user ', ' PWUO ', ' people who use opioids ', ' persons who use opioids ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,K23,2021,190534,NY-12
"Electrophysiological Biomarkers to Optimize DBS for Depression PROJECT SUMMARY Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate (SCC) white matter is an emerging new treatment strategy for treatment resistant depression (TRD) with published studies demonstrating sustained long-term antidepressant effects in 40-60% of implanted patients. Converging evidence from positron emission tomography (PET), electroencephalography (EEG) and diffusion tractography (DTI) strongly suggests that DBS mediates its clinical benefits by direct modulation of the SCC--a key hub in an aberrant neural circuit. Despite encouraging sustained long-term effects in this notoriously difficult to treat patient population, randomized controls trials of SCC DBS and other DBS targets for TRD are now on hold as initial results failed to meet predefined clinical endpoints. While this proposal cannot address those failures directly, a clear necessary next step for effective future testing and eventual dissemination of this treatment is the need to develop brain-based biomarkers to guide lead placement and to titrate stimulation parameters during ongoing care. In the absence of such biomarkers to guide DBS use, there will continue to be variability in the implementation of clinical procedures during testing, leading to ambiguous and possibly misleading trial outcomes, and subsequent abandonment of a potentially useful treatment. To overcome these limitations, we propose to develop and test objective methods for reliable device configuration in individuals by optimizing DBS-SCC treatment with respect to human functional anatomy and key electrophysiological variables. We will leverage the capabilities of a novel bi-directional neuromodulation system (Medtronic RC+S) that allows live streaming of oscillatory activity at the site of stimulation to define novel control strategies to guide programming decisions for DBS delivery. Ongoing measurements of SCC local field potentials (LFPs) will be combined with electroencephalography (EEG) and event related potential studies (ERP) performed as part of an experimental clinical trial of subcallosal cingulate DBS for TRD to identify an oscillatory signal that (1) is sensitive to changes in frequency and current parameters at the tractography defined optimal target and (2) tracks with depression state over time. Connectome-based and machine learning approaches will be used to define the most robust network biomarker and its response characteristics. Once defined, the control policy will be tested in a second phase feasibility study where parameters for initial stimulation will be selected based on the depression brain state biomarker and adjustments made to correct drift from the predefined target signal. If successful, the data- driven model and control strategy will enable objective, rational clinical programming of DBS stimulation for depression and provide a new model and approach for target identification, stimulation initiation and long-term monitoring and management of patients receiving this treatment. . NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to refine and optimize deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate white matter for patients with treatment resistant depression. Using a newly available bi- directional neuromodulation system that allows live streaming of oscillatory activity at the site of stimulation, this study will define novel control strategies to guide programming decisions for DBS delivery providing a new evidence-based strategy for target identification, stimulation initiation and long-term monitoring and management of patients receiving this treatment.",Electrophysiological Biomarkers to Optimize DBS for Depression,9869948,UH3NS103550,"['Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Antidepressive Agents ', ' Antidepressant Agent ', ' Antidepressant Drugs ', ' Antidepressants ', ' anti-depressant agent ', ' anti-depressant drugs ', ' anti-depressants ', ' anti-depressive agents ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diffusion ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Methods ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Patients ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' PET ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET imaging ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PETT ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' Publishing ', ' Scalp structure ', ' Scalp ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Failure ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Event-Related Potentials ', ' event related potential ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Deep Brain Stimulation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' novel ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Devices ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' open label ', ' open label study ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' Implant ', ' implantation ', ' control trial ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' treatment strategy ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' treatment-resistant depression ', ' treatment-refractory depression ', ' support tools ', ' targeted biomarker ', ' antidepressant effect ', ' anti-depressant effect ', ' connectome ', ' tractography ', ' clinical decision support ', ' clinical implementation ', ' algorithm development ', ' live stream ', ' livestream ', ' ']",NINDS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,UH3,2021,1367977,NY-13
"Digital Mental Health Service for Non-Treatment Seeking Young Adults PROJECT SUMMARY  Young adults aged 18-24 experience higher levels of mental health problems than any other adult age group. Over one quarter of all young adults living in the United States suffer from a mental health condition. Unfortunately, they are the adult age group who are least likely to seek or receive traditional face-to-face treatments such as in-person psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy. There is evidence that they are, however, interested in using digital mental health interventions (DMHIs), such as mobile and web-based apps, to support symptom self-management and skill building. While evidence suggests mental health apps can effectively reduce symptom severity, they require motivation from the user to open and use the app, which contributes to the high dropout rates. The primary method of addressing dropout has been the use of human coaching, which boosts engagement.  SMS text messages arrive through the most commonly used app on the phone, and are therefore likely to be viewed. Initial work in text message interventions suggests good adherence, as effort is low, but effectiveness has been inconsistent. Messages can be perceived as off-target or impersonal, and it is difficult to convey more complex information. This project aims to address these problems by developing and piloting a personalized text messaging platform that uses machine learning to tailor SMS messages to an individual’s needs and preferences, and URL links to provide access to psychoeducational content to contextualize messages, when the length of that content exceeds the limitations of messages. This project will include a partnership with Mental Health America, the nation’s largest mental health advocacy organization.  The primary goals of the project are to: (1) Develop an adaptive messaging service for young adults that personalizes messages and psychoeducational content to the needs and preferences of an individual, (2) Conduct a feasibility trial using a sequential multiple assignment randomized treatment (SMART) design, which will evalutate (a) the effectiveness of an adaptive, personalized messaging intervention in reducing engagement relative to a static version; and (b) whether human coaching results in greater symptom reduction and engagement, relative an unguided implementation.  This project will, in the near term, allow us to determine the feasibility of this intervention, including whether our adaptive intervention affects treatment psychological and engagement targets, and reduces psychological distress. It will also provide preliminary information on the feasibility of a scalable model of targeted, low- intensity coaching for users who may require additional support above and beyond a fully automated intervention. This will prepare us for our longer-term goal of conducting a fully-powered randomized controlled trial of our adaptive intervention in an online community setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop and evaluate a highly personalized SMS text messaging intervention for depression and anxiety among young adults, who are not interested in receiving traditional psychological or psychiatric treatment for their psychological symptoms. We will use machine learning to provide young adults with the most useful SMS messages and the most relevant psychological strategy modules. In partnership with Mental Health America, the nation’s largest mental health advocacy organization, this project has the potential to establish a highly scalable digital mental health service.",Digital Mental Health Service for Non-Treatment Seeking Young Adults,10285466,R34MH124960,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Americas ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Attitude ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Dropout ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Voice ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Coping Skills ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' Self Management ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Psychiatric therapeutic procedure ', ' psychiatric care ', ' psychiatric therapy ', ' psychiatric treatment ', ' Chronic ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Treatment Period ', ' treatment days ', ' treatment duration ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' self reliance ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' psychological distress ', ' Modeling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Experimental Therapies ', ' Investigational Treatments ', ' experimental therapeutic agents ', ' experimental therapeutics ', ' Investigational Therapies ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' intervention for prevention ', ' prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' preventive intervention ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' health literacy ', ' treatment trial ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' psychological outcomes ', ' aged ', ' advocacy organizations ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' iterative design ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' psychoeducational ', ' community setting ', ' secondary outcome ', ' screening ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' anxious symptom ', ' online community ', ' on-line community ', ' virtual community ', ' symptom self management ', ' reduce symptoms ', ' alleviate symptom ', ' ameliorating symptom ', ' decrease symptom ', ' fewer symptoms ', ' relieves symptoms ', ' symptom alleviation ', ' symptom reduction ', ' symptom relief ', ' psychological symptom ', ' Text Messaging ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' human model ', ' model of human ', ' feasibility trial ', ' adaptive intervention ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' text messaging intervention ', ' text based intervention ', ' text intervention ', ' digital mental health ', ' ']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R34,2021,219658,IL-07

"Development and Pilot Testing of a Just in Time Mobile Smoking Cessation Intervention for Persons living with HIV PROJECT SUMMARY This application, in direct response to PAR-19-309, will systematically develop and pilot test the Sense2Quit App to improve tobacco cessation in persons living with HIV (PLWH). The prevalence of cigarette smoking among PLWH is more than three times that of the general adult United States (U.S.) population. The high prevalence of cigarette smoking and the high incidence of tobacco-related cancer and other smoking-related diseases among PLWH calls for swift action to intervene to reduce tobacco use rates. However, evidence to guide tobacco cessation in PLWH is inadequate. To address this need, our team proposes to develop, and pilot test the Sense2Quit App, a multi-component smartphone app which provides just-in-time feedback; specifically addresses challenges to tobacco cessation for PLWH: slips, relapses, and difficulties associated with neurocognitive deficits; supports both self-efficacy and decisional balance; and provides quit plan reminders. The artificial intelligence algorithm (validated by our study team) interprets data from a smartwatch to detect smoking hand motions – a technology with more than 98% accuracy in differentiating “lighting up” from other similar motions. The Sense2Quit App leverages smartwatch data and detects when and where smoking activity occurs so that a message can be sent in real time to the participant to help them manage the slip (a puff or two) from becoming a relapse. This just-in-time feedback is critical especially in the first few weeks of a quit attempt. Additionally, Global Positioning System data can help participants avoid triggers (coffee shops, smoking relatives, or friends' homes, etc.). Finally, the Sense2Quit App provides information on how well smokers are progressing through their quit plan, support tips, and motivational tools (i.e., badges related to saving money from not purchasing cigarettes). The specific aims of the proposed study are to: 1) Explore and identify, using qualitative methods, acceptable and appropriate app content and features of the Sense2Quit App to support smoking cessation and relapse prevention in PLWH who smoke; 2) Conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the Sense2Quit App in a sample of 60 PLWH who smoke; and 3) Employ the RE-AIM framework to assess the potential scale-up of the Sense2Quit App. As part of the pilot trial, we will randomize 60 HIV-positive smokers to the Sense2Quit App, standard smoking cessation counseling, and nicotine replacement therapy (active condition) versus standard smoking cessation counseling plus nicotine replacement therapy (control) and examine group differences in rate of quit attempts, 7-day point prevalence abstinence, and sustained abstinence. We will calculate an effect size estimate of the Sense2Quit App to guide, in part, the sample size needed for a larger scale clinical trial. The knowledge gained from the proposed research will enable the scientific community and patients to improve tobacco cessation in those persons who are in most need in the U.S. Given our team's unique and complementary expertise in each of the areas necessary to develop an innovative smoking cessation intervention to improve outcomes among PLWH, we are confident that the findings from this study will be easily scaled-up for further testing to ensure improvement in health outcomes for PLWH. PROJECT NARRATIVE The prevalence of smoking in the general United States population has gradually declined to the lowest rate ever recorded; however, this has not been true for persons living with HIV (PLWH). Therefore, our study team seeks to develop and pilot test Sense2Quit, a tobacco cessation intervention for PLWH. The knowledge gained from this research will enable the scientific community, clinicians, and community stakeholders to improve tobacco cessation outcomes for PLWH.",Development and Pilot Testing of a Just in Time Mobile Smoking Cessation Intervention for Persons living with HIV,10335352,R21CA265961,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Coffee ', ' Communities ', ' Counseling ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Geography ', ' Gestures ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' Incidence ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Lighting ', ' Illumination ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity -

"Deep machine learning to delineate trajectories of vulnerability and transition to mental illness in youth Most mental illness originates in youth: 50% of mental illness is diagnosed by the age of 14, and 75% by 24. Manifest illness emerges after a period of ~8-10 years. Remarkably, functional MRI can detect disrupted patterns of brain function associated with these vulnerable trajectories. However, the emergence of manifest mental illness reflects a complex and dynamic interplay of many biological, developmental, social and environmental factors that may be risky or protective, shared across illness categories, co-vary, and currently lack specificity. Moreover, the ability of fMRI and serial assessment to detect clinically-relevant shifts in dynamic risk trajectories of mental illness is poorly defined. Charting mental illness trajectories to optimize intervention is a critical need. A major obstacle is the identification of specific neural-behavioral risk pathways that shape vulnerable developmental trajectories into various categories of manifest mental illness. The long-term goal of my research is to develop computational approaches to advance our understanding of risk trajectories in the mental health of youth. Consequently, the overall objective of this study is to leverage advanced machine learning methods to illuminate dynamic trajectories of mental illness progression, to characterize sustained mental health and to quantify the incremental predictive value of serial and functional MRI assessment. My central hypothesis is that specific risk pathways that have specific brain functional correlates characterize discrete peri-adolescent trajectories in major mental illness categories. Further, that functional MRI metrics and serial assessment significantly improve case prediction. This study will leverage a new, unprecedented opportunity to dissect risk trajectories by applying deep machine learning to ‘big data’ from 20,000 diverse youth, including longitudinal data. I will characterize the behavior and specificity of dynamic risk trajectories and their functional neural correlates in 5 major peri-adolescent mental illness categories and determine the incremental predictive value of adding functional MRI to bio-psycho-social data and continuing assessment after age 10, the developmental inflection point for mental illness. Further innovation will accrue from the use of a cloud computing infrastructure to perform the research. My rationale is that elucidating specific risk trajectories and how to best monitor them in peri-adolescence will stimulate more refined prevention and early intervention strategies in youth mental health, known to improve outcomes and reduce resource use. Concomitantly, I will obtain capstone training in advanced machine learning methods, programming and cloud computing infrastructure, building on my KL2 training in machine learning, data science and the acquisition and analysis of fMRI and bio-psycho-social data. An interdisciplinary mentorship team of international experts in data science, developmental psychopathology, bioinformatics, epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Washington will prepare me for my transition to independence as a physician-scientist working at the interface of computational science and population youth mental health, and as a child and adolescent psychiatrist specializing in neurodevelopmental disorders. Charting mental illness trajectories in community populations of diverse youth to optimize early intervention is a critical need in population mental health. The goal of this study is to leverage advanced machine learning methods in unique, new ‘big data’ from 20,000 diverse youth to illuminate dynamic trajectories of mental illness progression, to characterize sustained mental health and to quantify the incremental predictive value of serial and functional MRI assessment. The resulting body of work will elucidate specific dynamic risk trajectories and suggest how to monitor them in peri-adolescence and stimulate more refined prevention and early intervention strategies in youth mental health, known to improve outcomes and reduce resource use. !",Deep machine learning to delineate trajectories of vulnerability and transition to mental illness in youth,10441036,R00MH118359,[''],NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R00,2021,249000,UT-02
"Combining data sources to identify effect moderation for personalized mental health treatment Project Summary Determining “what works for whom” is a key goal in prevention and treatment across a variety of areas, including mental health. By understanding which individuals benefit most from which treatments we have the possibility of directing scarce resources to those who will most benefit, and of reducing the “churn” of individuals attempting multiple treatments before finding the one that works for them. Identifying effect moderators—factors that relate to the size of treatment effects--is crucial for delivery of treatment and prevention interventions, but doing so is incredibly difficult using standard study designs. Randomized trials, the gold standard for estimating average effects, are typically under-powered to detect moderation. Large-scale non- experimental studies may provide another way to examine effect moderation, but can suffer from confounding. New methods are needed to best harness the data available to learn how to personalize mental health treatments. This work will synthesize, extend, and apply methods for identifying effect moderators when multiple studies are available, with a particular focus on the complexities in mental health research. The methods will apply broadly and will be illustrated in an example estimating the effects of medication treatment for schizophrenia, using data from 11 randomized controlled trials and non-experimental data from the Duke University Health System electronic health record. The work will: 1) Extend moderation methods for scenarios with multiple randomized experiments, 2) Develop methods for using data from combined datasets with both experimental and non-experimental designs to identify effect moderation, and 3) Disseminate the methods to mental health researchers. By developing methods to take full advantage of both experimental and non-experimental data this work has the potential to move towards personalized mental health, thus improving how we prevent and treat mental health challenges in the population.

"Generalizing and Standardizing fMRI Tools for Differentiating Mental Illnesses and Predicting Medication-Class Response in Patients Project Summary/Abstract  Mood disorders, like many psychiatric conditions, have their onset in emerging adulthood and often last a lifetime. Mental illnesses have an excessively large loading of Disability Adjusted Life Years, making early intervention crucial for both individuals and society. Differentiating bipolar disorder (BD) from major depressive disorder (MDD) based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) can be especially challenging if clear mania is absent. In fact, BD patients go an average of 6-10 years without the proper diagnosis, with 70% misdiagnosed with MDD instead. The challenge of identifying BD patients among depressed individuals is complex but critical because diagnosis determines treatment. The use of antidepressant (AD) medications in patients with BD can lead to worsening of illness. We have recently shown that, using resting fMRI, we can predict future medication class response with high accuracy (> 90%). In this project we will build on this work to generalize to a new MRI scanner and clinical assessment protocol. In addition we will develop, in consultation with multiple psychiatrists, a cloud-based tool to analyze and report the results from the brain imaging protocol and machine learning analysis, in a timely, meaningful, and interpretable manner. Results are expected to be an important step forward in the eventual development of clinical useful markers of mental illness. 2 Project Narrative  Patients with mood disorders will often spend months to years on the wrong medication, which can also make them worse (e.g., putting individuals with bipolar disorder on antidepressants). There is a great need to develop biomarkers of treatment response in mental illness. This work will build on recent work from our group showing over 90% accuracy using resting fMRI predictors to further generalize the results to multiple scanners and develop an online portal to process and provide reporting of results (classification results) as well as processed data and citation information.",Generalizing and Standardizing fMRI Tools for Differentiating Mental Illnesses

"The Digital Phenotype of Bipolar Disorder: Harnessing Technology to Identify Bipolar Mood Symptoms Project Summary Bipolar disorder (BD) is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. It typically begins in adolescence or early adulthood, an important developmental period during which higher education, first jobs, and relationships are pursued. Recurrent mood episodes during this period can have a devastating impact on a young person's ability to achieve a high quality of life as an adult. A method by which to predict the onset of mood symptoms in adolescence would create an opportunity to intervene and reduce exposure to the harmful effects of recurrent episodes. A new approach – digital phenotyping – may make this possible. Digital phenotyping is defined as the “moment-by-moment quantification of the human phenotype in situ” using data collected from smartphone sensors (accelerometer, texts, calls, GPS). Digital phenotyping has been used to identify mood changes and potential signs of relapse in adults with BD, but has not yet been applied to adolescents. We will use Beiwe, a digital phenotyping application for iOS and Android phones, to collect digital phenotypes from participants (aged 14-19) over 18-months (N=120; n=70 with BD [I, II, Other Specified], n=50 typically-developing). Over the follow-up period, participants will complete biweekly mood assessments, and both participants and caregivers will be interviewed monthly to track changes in mood/behavior. This will allow the phone sensor data collected with Beiwe to be closely linked to symptom changes. The specific aims of this project are (1) to characterize the digital phenotype of BD symptoms in adolescents, (2) to describe differences in the digital phenotypes of the BD and typically developing groups, and (3) to develop a model for predicting mood symptoms prospectively. The proposed study is consistent with all four NIMH strategic objectives for the future of mental health research. This K23 Award will provide Anna Van Meter, PhD with the necessary training and mentorship to (1) gain proficiency in computational psychiatry by learning to analyze longitudinal data using statistical and machine learning techniques, (2) build expertise in patient-oriented translational research by designing and conducting a longitudinal study with youth participants; (3) learn to employ state-of-the-art mobile technology to personalize assessment and intervention using patient data. To accomplish these training goals, Dr. Van Meter has organized an outstanding mentorship team (Anil Malhotra, MD, Jukka-Pekka Onnela, DSc, John Kane, MD, Christoph Correll, MD, and Deborah Estrin, PhD), with expertise in patient-oriented research, technology-based mental health research, computational psychiatry, bipolar disorder in youth, and computer science. The proposed study will be the first to describe the digital phenotype of BD in adolescents, a population at great risk for the onset of BD as well as the damaging effects of repeated episodes. The completion of the proposed K23 Mentored Career Award will support an innovative program of patient-oriented research, and will provide Dr. Van Meter with the skills necessary to become an independent investigator pursuing novel technological solutions to improve patients' quality of life.

"Model-based neural control of brain stimulation for neuropsychiatric disorders PROJECT SUMMARY Neuropsychiatric disorders are a leading cause of disability worldwide, with depressive disorders being the most disabling among them. Many patients are resistant to all current treatments. Invasive electrical brain stimulation for treatment-resistant depression showed early promise in open-label studies but has had variable efficacy in controlled clinical trials. To date, stimulation in neuropsychiatric disorders has been limited to an open-loop approach that applies a fixed pattern of continuous stimulation regardless of symptom levels. One limitation is that open-loop stimulation does not track the inter- and intra-subject variabilities in neuropsychiatric symptoms, which can change rapidly in an individual. Another limitation is the lack of an input-output model that can guide stimulation by predicting how ongoing stimulation input drives large-scale neural activity and the symptoms it underlies in an individual. We will address these limitations to enable precise invasive electrical brain stimulation for neuropsychiatric disorders by developing a novel real-time model-based neural control system. We will provide proof-of-concept demonstration for acute control of neural biomarkers of mood states related to depression symptoms in epilepsy patients with implanted intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) electrodes, in whom we will obtain repeated mood self-reports and perform stimulation simultaneously with neural recording. The system will continuously adjust the stimulation parameters, for the first time, based on 2 elements: (i) Novel personalized input-output model learned on recorded brain network response while delivering a new stochastic stimulation waveform to excite network activity. (ii) Personalized decoder trained on multi-day continuous iEEG recordings and simultaneous mood self-reports to estimate mood state variations from neural activity as feedback. Combining these, we will build a real-time model-based closed-loop system to precisely drive the neurally-decoded mood state—the neural biomarker of mood—to a target level. Our system generalizes to any stimulation site. Here, we will demonstrate the system with orbitofrontal stimulation as we have shown it to acutely improve mood and modulate large-scale mood-relevant brain activity. We will run real-time closed-loop experiments in each patient. The system will estimate the neural biomarker from iEEG and adjust the stimulation amplitude and frequency in real-time based on the input-output model to drive the estimated biomarker to a target level. We will also develop model-free closed-loop on-off stimulation that turns stimulation on-off based on the neural biomarker. We will compare model-based, on-off and open-loop stimulations. Success of this program will enable precisely regulating a desired brain state by developing the first model-based closed- loop invasive brain stimulation system and advancing neuromodulation technology. It will also directly inform electrical stimulation therapy in future pivotal clinical trials of refractory depression. The developed system and gained knowledge will generalize across many neuropsychiatric disorders with broad public health impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE Direct electrical stimulation of the brain holds promise for patients with refractory neuropsychiatric conditions and in particular treatment-resistant depression but has been limited to delivering a fixed stimulation pattern and shown variable efficacy in clinical trials. We propose that one way to improve efficacy is to build a novel model- based system that adjusts the stimulation based on recording brain signals that are related to mood symptoms and modeling how ongoing stimulation changes these signals.

The primary care provider remains in the center of the process with his/her prior relationship with the family and humanity enabled with computer assistance prior to the encounter as well as moment of care reminders and teleprompted specific hints aimed at enhancing a patient focused balanced discussion of individual strengths and barriers to the teens goals known as a motivational interview. This is made feasible through pre-visit data collection providing relevant details to highlight as well as data to support omitting some traditional guidance areas with lower priority for the individual teen. Any conclusions coming from PCP recommendations and shared decision making is reinforced by a computer-based, always available chatbot guided by artificial intelligence that serves as a bridge to other helping professionals, strengths building resources, as well as conversations based on proven mental health therapies based on earlier pilot data for reducing depressive symptoms. These innovations will be tested via a cluster randomized control trial, demonstrating whether use of the system results in higher rates of screening, reductions in depressive symptoms, and accessing of evidence-based treatment for teen depression. Use of the system is reinforced by engagement of primary doctors and child psychiatrists in a related quality improvement program with data from their participation providing needed feedback for recertification of professional status requirements of their respective specialty boards. Success of the system would mean a new primary care workflow-friendly tool which could help adolescents avoid the significant functional impairment and increased risks that accompany teen depression. If this new paradigm for adolescent health supervision proves useful for depression, adaptations for other teen challenges might also be promising. Approximately 12.5% of U.S. 12-17 year olds had at least one major depressive episode in the past year. Yet, up to 70% of teens with mental health (MH) care needs do not receive necessary care. This proposal addresses the significant public health problem of teen depression through use of a comprehensive, process-driven intervention targeting time points before, during, and after routine visits with primary care providers (PCPs) through a new module to an online clinical process support system called CHADIS.",Online system for identifying and addressing teen depression in primary care,10207414,R44MH116751,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Appointment ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Child Psychiatry ', ' Computers ', ' Data Collection ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Interview ', ' single episode major depressive disorder ', ' Single major depression ', ' Single major depressive episode ', ' major depressive episode ', ' single episode Major Depression ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Moods ', ' Office Visits ', ' physician office visit ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Psychiatrist ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recommendation ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Specialty Boards ', ' Supervision ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Specialist ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Training ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' tool ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', "" Ch'i "", ' Qi ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' Co-ordination disorder ', ' Coordination Disorder ', ' Dyscoordination ', ' Incoordination ', ' Lack of Coordination ', ' Abnormal coordination ', ' Visit ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' success ', ' Check-up ', ' checkup ', ' checkup examination ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Agreement ', ' motivational interview ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' Modality ', ' depression screening ', ' Depression screen ', ' Social Support System ', ' Support System ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' behavioral health ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Teenagers ', ' Teen ', ' teen years ', ' teenage ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Depression and Suicide ', ' depression and suicidality ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' Health Professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' child depression ', ' adolescent depression ', ' adolescents with depression ', ' childhood depression ', ' childhood onset depression ', ' depressed adolescents ', ' depression in adolescence ', ' pediatric depression ', ' youth depression ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' 17 year old ', ' 17 years of age ', ' age 17 years ', ' seventeen year old ', ' seventeen years of age ', ' volunteer ', ' control trial ', ' shared decision making ', ' screening ', ' adolescent health ', ' recruit ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' barrier to care ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' care coordination ', ' coordinating care ', ' implementation strategy ', ' strategies for implementation ', ' chatbot ', ' chat bot ', ' ']",NIMH,"TOTAL CHILD HEALTH, INC.",R44,2021,507941,MD-03
"Sex hormones and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Project Summary The untreated burden of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the United States is a massive contributor to healthcare budgets in both the military and civilian sectors, and better treatment and prevention methods are needed. Fortunately, awareness of PTSD among military service members has grown in recent years, and yet, there is a hidden epidemic of PTSD among civilians and women. Women experience PTSD at about twice the rate of men (11% vs. 5%), but the causes for this sex difference are largely unknown. It has long been suspected that sex hormones play a major role in development of – and also potentially protection from – PTSD and other mental health disorders. This project will provide the largest ever study of sex hormone effects on PTSD and the related mental health outcomes of depression and anxiety disorders. Whereas studies in the past were limited by small sample sizes and results were inconclusive, this investigation will use a massive sample size of approximately 500,000 participants to answer questions about two well-known sex hormones (testosterone and estradiol) and three psychiatric outcomes (PTSD, depression, and anxiety disorders). These variables were measured in the UK Biobank, and we have been granted access to the data to study sex hormone effects on mental health outcomes and to study genetic effects underlying both sex hormone levels and mental health disorders. The completion of this work will reveal whether rates of mental health disorders vary with testosterone and estradiol levels. It may be the case that levels of hormones that are both too high and too low are problematic. Given this reality, we will use sophisticated regression and machine learning techniques, and therefore we will be able to detect linear and non-linear relationships between sex hormones and PTSD, depression, and anxiety disorders. The sample size and study design make this the most powerful study conducted to date, and the results will be generalizable to diverse populations. In addition to the outcomes mentioned above, we will further explore genetic effects underlying relationships between sex hormones and mental health disorders. To do this, we will conduct genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of both testosterone and estradiol. We will then make polygenic scores for testosterone and estradiol, yielding genetic proxies of sex hormone levels which can be used in studies in which sex hormones have not been measured. Finally, we will test for shared genetic effects between genetic effects on sex hormones and genetic effects on psychiatric disorders in order to better understand the etiology of these common, debilitating, and inadequately treated mental health disorders. Taken together, these findings will provide critical foundational knowledge relevant to clinical trials which are currently testing testosterone and estradiol as treatments for PTSD, depression, and anxiety disorders. These results will also provide actionable findings for the development of novel treatment and prevention strategies. Project Narrative Sex hormone altering medications are prescribed to over 40% of American adults, and yet the mental health consequences of sex hormones are still poorly understood. This project will be the largest ever investigation of sex hormone effects on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety disorders, and the results of this powerful study design will provide much-needed information relevant to the development of new treatment and prevention strategies. The precision medicine approach used here relies on biomarkers and results will be tailored to individuals. 1",Sex hormones and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),10398466,R01MH123486,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Awareness ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Budgets ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Epidemic ', ' Estradiol ', ' Aquadiol ', ' Dimenformon ', ' Diogyn ', ' Diogynets ', ' Estrace ', ' Estradiol-17 beta ', ' Estradiol-17beta ', ' Estraldine ', ' Ovocyclin ', ' Ovocylin ', ' Progynon ', ' Therapeutic Estradiol ', ' Foundations ', ' Grant ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hormones ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Military Personnel ', ' Armed Forces Personnel ', ' Military ', ' military population ', ' Play ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' medication prescription ', ' prescribed medication ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Gonadal Steroid Hormones ', ' Sex Hormones ', ' Sex Steroid Hormones ', ' gonadal steroids ', ' sex steroid ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' post-trauma stress disorder ', ' posttrauma stress disorder ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Testing ', ' Testosterone ', ' Therapeutic Testosterone ', ' Trans-Testosterone ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Techniques ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Proxy ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Prevention ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Data ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' genome wide association study ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' Outcome ', ' treatment strategy ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' Genetic study ', ' service member ', ' military member ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Differences between sexes ', ' Differs between sexes ', ' Sexual differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' military service ', ' ']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,78738,CA-18
"Adaptive Messaging to Support Depression Self-Management Summary Automated messaging has significant potential to extend access to guidance and support for those managing common mental health conditions like depression. However, benefits of automated messaging could be improved through building capacity to automatically adapt messaging approaches to users’ needs. The PI’s career goal is to establish scalable digital mental health interventions that deliver individualized communication to maximize users’ engagement in effectively managing mental health concerns. This proposal outlines training and research plans to achieve this goal, culminating in a successful R01 proposal. The training plan takes full advantage of the strong institutional support and environment at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine and the Center for Behavioral Intervention Technologies, which is led by the primary mentor for this proposal. Training goals necessary to the PI’s career goal include growth in (1) user-centered design, (2) adaptive interventions, and (3) clinical science methodologies. This proposal builds on the PI’s background in communication science, which has focused on effective message design and social support provision. In this K01, the PI will aim to develop a model for delivering automated, individualized self-management support for depression, emphasizing messaging that can accommodate fluctuations in users’ motivations and abilities to carry out cognitive and behavioral self-management strategies. This will be achieved through the following specific aims: (1) conduct user-centered design activities and usability testing to design and refine a messaging system; (2) integrate a reinforcement learning algorithm into the system that adapts content to users and their contexts; and (3) pilot procedures and analyses for a randomized controlled trial and obtain preliminary evidence of the intervention’s effectiveness and mechanisms of action. For Aim 3, I will test hypotheses that messaging interventions will result in greater reduction in depression than a waitlist control group, and that adaptive messaging will reduce depression relative to non-adaptive messaging by producing greater engagement in self-management. This research is expected to advance the design of messaging interventions for depression, ultimately extending the reach and effectiveness of these interventions. Skills acquired by carrying out the research proposed in this application will allow the PI to successfully compete for R01 funding in order to conduct a larger effectiveness trial. Narrative Technology-based interventions hold promise to extend the availability of support for individuals managing mental health concerns, but their success requires keeping users engaged over time. This K01 proposal leverages machine learning to establish a messaging intervention that can automatically adapt communication styles to accommodate users’ individualized support needs and preferences and their fluctuations over time. If successful, this project will lead to a scalable intervention model that delivers engaging, personalized support while imposing low burden on users and the health system, and that could be broadly applied to address a wide variety of mental health conditions.",Adaptive Messaging to Support Depression Self-Management,10301596,K01MH125172,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anxiety ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Communication ', ' Control Groups ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Program Development ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recommendation ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Science ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Societies ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' Self Management ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Funding ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' behavior change ', ' meetings ', ' preference ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' Modality ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' psychoeducation ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' Behavioral ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' treatment effect ', ' tailored messaging ', ' user centered design ', ' usability ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' recruit ', ' Text Messaging ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' adaptive intervention ', ' learning algorithm ', ' intervention refinement ', ' digital health ', ' digital mental health ', ' ']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K01,2021,175377,IL-07
"Invasive decoding and stimulation of altered reward computations in depression Abstract Depression is a highly prevalent mental health disorder that affects millions of people in the US and causes significant impacts on well-being, rates of disability and health care costs. Despite these substantial impacts and costs, the effectiveness of current therapeutical options for the treatment of depression is limited. In recent years there have been efforts to develop deep-brain stimulation (DBS) strategies guided by results from non-invasive imaging studies. Unfortunately, these have failed to show significant efficacy, likely because of the vast heterogeneity in disease presentation and the lack of sufficient data to understand the neurobiological causes of the disease. Current approaches use unspecific biological (pharmacology) or anatomical (DBS) targets, leading to partial effectiveness and side effects. Patient-specific depictions of the basis of depression would allow tailored treatment designs, but data of sufficient quality is mostly unavailable with standard approaches to the study of neural function. Recent approaches leverage multi-areal invasive electrophysiological recordings in neurosurgical epilepsy patients, which often suffer from co-morbid depression, to collect of high-quality (multi-areal, high signal-to-noise, high temporal resolution) neurophysiological data, and have the potential to allow patient-specific models of disease and targeted neurostimulation. In addition, machine learning methods allow mapping this high-dimensional neural data onto patient’s emotional states centrally affected in depression, and highlight the involvement of single-site and cross-areal activity in limbic regions, including the hippocampus, amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex. However, decoding methods present several challenges of their own. First, they select features associated with self-reported mood - a complex, abstract concept that lacks an objective, quantitative foundation and may be reported differently across patients, making generalization challenging. Second, data-driven methods are not grounded on current models of brain function, and thus lack mechanistic explanations of disease underpinnings. Third, mood is reported in the absence of overt behavior, making it difficult to frame the deficits in the behavioral functions subserved by affected brain areas. Finally, current approaches lack a connection between decoded neural features and stimulation strategies. Here, we propose to address these challenges by combining distributed iEEG recordings, reinforcement learning models of decision-making and machine-learning approaches to study reward processing in relevant brain areas from epilepsy patients with and without comorbid depression. We will examine local activations as well as circuit dynamics (functional connectivity) in orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala and hippocampus during decision- making behavior. We will seek to ground neurophysiological data in reinforcement learning models of decision-making to provide quantitative, reproducible behavioral metrics that impact mood, and to build on long-standing observations regarding damaged reward processing in depression. Finally, we will develop patient-tailored stimulation paradigms for depression constrained by our observations on patient-specific disease presentation. We expect that the combination of invasive recordings with reward modeling will open the door to a theoretically-grounded computational characterization of neurobehavioral deficits in depression, and allow development of novel treatment strategies. Project narrative Depression is highly prevalent in intractable epilepsy patients undergoing invasive electrophysiological monitoring, which provides a unique opportunity to study highly detailed, multi-areal brain activity across depression states. We propose to combine distributed intracranial electroencephalography recordings, reinforcement learning of decision-making and machine-learning approaches to study how reward and mood processing is affected across multiple brain areas in depression. We will use the resulting models of the neurobehavioral basis of depression to develop new patient-tailored invasive neurostimulation therapeutical strategies.",Invasive decoding and stimulation of altered reward computations in depression,10282883,R01MH124763,"['Affect ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Decision Making ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Foundations ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Moods ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Rewards ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Technology ', ' Regrets ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' Anhedonia ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Therapeutic ', ' depressed ', ' sadness ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Deep Brain Stimulation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' novel ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Reporting ', ' neural function ', ' Neurophysiology - biologic function ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Refractory epilepsy ', ' drug-resistant epilepsy ', ' Intractable Epilepsy ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Brain region ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Biological Pharmacology ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' brain machine interface ', ' neural model ', ' reward processing ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' treatment strategy ', ' non-invasive imaging ', ' noninvasive imaging ', ' individualized medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapeutic strategy ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' depressed patient ', ' temporal measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' comorbid depression ', ' co-morbid depression ', ' co-morbid with depression ', ' co-morbidity with depression ', ' comorbid with depression ', ' comorbidity with depression ', ' depression co-morbidity ', ' depression comorbidity ', ' imaging study ', ' high dimensionality ', ' side effect ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,767520,NY-13
"SCH: Personalized Depression Treatment Support by Mobile Sensor Analytics  The current best practice guidelines for treating depression call for close monitoring of patients, and periodically adjusting treatment as needed. This project will advance personalized depression treatment by developing an innovative system, DepWatch, that leverages mobile health technologies and machine learning tools to provide clinicians objective, accurate, and timely assessment of depression symptoms to assist with their clinical decision making process. Specifically, DepWatch collects sensory data passively from smartphones and wristbands, without any user interaction, and uses simple user-friendly interfaces to collect ecological momentary assessments (EMA), medication adherence and safety related data from patients. The collected data will be fed to machine learning models to be developed in the project to provide weekly assessment of patient symptom levels and predict the trajectory of treatment response over time. The assessment and prediction results are then presented using a graphic interface to clinicians to help them make critical treatment decisions. Our project comprises two studies. Phase I collects sensory data and other data (e.g., clinical data, EMA, tolerability and safety data) from 250 adult participants with unstable depression symptomatology. The data thus collected will be used to develop and validate assessment and prediction models, which will be incorporated into DepWatch system. In Phase II, three clinicians will use DepWatch to support their clinical decision making process; a total of 50 participants under treatment by the three participating clinicians will be recruited for the study. A number of innovative machine learning techniques will be developed. These include a set of new learning formulations to construct matrix-based longitudinal predictive models, and determine the temporal contingency and the most influential features, and deep learning based data imputation methods that can handle both problems of sporadic missing data as well as missing data in an entire view. In addition, multi-task feature learning models and feature selection techniques will be expanded and refined for this challenging setting of large-scale heterogeneous data. The project is highly relevant to public and global health because it will provide a significant step forward in providing effective and patient-centric care in treating depression. It will help personalize depression treatment by identifying patients who are failing treatments early and will assist providers to take necessary actions before patients drop out of treatment.",SCH: Personalized Depression Treatment Support by Mobile Sensor Analytics ,10196980,R01MH119678,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Communities ', ' Data Sources ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Family ', ' Influentials ', ' Learning ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Noise ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Safety ', ' Self Administration ', ' Self-Administered ', ' Sleep ', ' Time ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' Caring ', ' Practice Guidelines ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Sensory ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Drops ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Provider ', ' global health ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict treatment response ', ' therapy prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Process ', ' medication compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' user-friendly ', ' multitask ', ' multi-task ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' Formulation ', ' symptomatology ', ' recruit ', ' deep learning ', ' autoencoder ', ' autoencoding neural network ', ' denoising ', ' de-noising ', ' medication safety ', ' drug safety ', ' pharmaceutical safety ', ' heterogenous data ', ' data heterogeneity ', ' data set heterogeneity ', ' dataset heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous data ', ' heterogeneous data sets ', ' heterogeneous datasets ', ' heterogenous data sets ', ' heterogenous datasets ', ' feature selection ', ' data de-identification ', ' data deidentification ', ' de-identified data ', ' deidentified data ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2021,245551,CT-02
"Predicting the onset of depression in at-risk adolescents from endophenotype profiles Project Summary/Abstract  Major depressive disorder (MDD) is uncommon in childhood, but becomes increasingly prevalent during adolescence. By the age of 18, about 15% of adolescents will have experienced at least one episode of MDD, with females twice as likely than males to have suffered an episode. This developmental surge in depression is especially high among teens who have a parent with a history of MDD, with close to half developing the disorder by the end of adolescence. Despite these epidemiological findings, and the range of negative downstream consequences linked to MDD, there are strikingly little data on the neural and behavioral abnormalities that confer risk for future depression onset in youth. The ability to prospectively predict MDD prior to its onset would have important clinical implications for the early identification of – and targeted deployment of interventions for – at-risk youth, which is strongly aligned with the NIMH Strategic Plan.  To address these gaps, adolescents ages 12-15 at increased risk of MDD onset by virtue of a parental history of MDD, as well as a control sample with no parental history of depression, will complete baseline neural (fMRI) and behavioral assessments of replicated endophenotypes of MDD (neuroticism, anhedonia, cognitive control deficits). Growing evidence and our preliminary data suggest that these endophenotypes are relatively stable trait-like risk markers, have non-overlapping neural substrates, and precede and prospectively predict depression onset. The project has three aims. First, we will evaluate the neural correlates of these three endophenotypes in an adolescent sample (n = 148), half of whom are at elevated risk of MDD (Aim 1). Second, during a 24-month follow-up phase, participants will be contacted by phone every 6 months and administered measures to assess changes in symptoms. Analyses will test whether behavioral and neural endophenotype measures prospectively predict onset of depressive symptoms during the follow-up phase. Importantly, to evaluate incremental predictive validity, we will test whether each endophenotype measure predicts future depressive symptoms above and beyond relevant clinical, familial/demographic and developmental variables previously linked with risk of future depression (Aim 2). Third, we will test whether multivariate machine learning models incorporating behavioral and neural endophenotype markers, as well as clinical, familial/demographic, and developmental characteristics, can be used to predict subject-specific risk of future depression onset with sufficiently high sensitivity and specificity to be clinically useful (Aim 3). Critically, recent advances in machine learning allow for the development of algorithms predicting risk at the individual level, as well as the integration of numerous predictors rather than relying on single variables that may, in isolation, have limited clinically-useful predictive value. Collectively, results are expected to advance our ability to predict the onset of depressive symptoms and, ultimately, to inform the development of a freely available, web-based risk calculator for predicting subject-specific depression risk. Project Narrative The prevalence of depression increases dramatically during adolescence, particularly for females. Using machine learning algorithms, the overarching goal of the project is to identify neural and behavioral markers that – in combination with clinical and demographic characteristics – reliably predict risk of developing depression during adolescence.

"Digital Phenotyping To Screen For Early Childhood Internalizing Disorders ABSTRACT Childhood anxiety and depression are common, impairing, and have the potential to disrupt development well into adulthood. Pediatricians need mental health screening tools to meet the prevalence of these internalizing disorders early in childhood. We have developed a promising digital health approach for detecting movement and speech phenotypes of internalizing disorders in young children. My long-term goal is to create a novel technology for screening young children for internalizing disorders at scale. My short term objective is to leverage my original approach and my proposed training curriculum to create a prototype mobile health (mHealth) application that provides a composite digital phenotype to detect childhood internalizing disorders. My specific aims are to (1) evaluate the validity of digital phenotypes measured by a novel mHealth system for identifying internalizing disorders in young children and (2) develop a composite digital phenotype for childhood internalizing disorders involving multiple constructs from the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) and identify moderating RDoC construct variables. If successful, these mHealth enabled digital phenotypes may be used to further NIMH health initiatives of enabling better tracking of changes in internalizing mental health status across childhood and supporting new and innovative research-practice partnerships with pediatrics to improve dissemination of evidence-based mental health screening. Similarly, this approach answers a need identified by the American Academic of Pediatrics for new tools that screen for behavioral and emotional problems. Seventy children between the ages of 4 and 8 years, oversampled for internalizing disorders, will be recruited for this study from pediatric and childhood mental health services at a university-based regional medical center that services the state of Vermont and upstate New York. They will be administered mood induction tasks design to press for RDoC Negative and Positive Valence constructs, while instrumented with a belt-worn smartphone enabled with the prototype mHealth application. A composite digital phenotype will be developed across constructs based on statistical classification models trained using machine learning on data captured during the tasks. To carry out this work as an independent investigator, I propose an intensive training curriculum to gain foundational skills in digital phenotyping. It includes training in (1) developmental epidemiology to better research early childhood psychopathology through a public health lens, and (2a) mobile app development to communicate effectively with app developers (2b) analysis of complex systems including machine learning approaches, (2c) ethical and societal issues regarding digital psychiatry. Completion of these training and research aims will provide me the skills and evidence to develop an easily administered digital health technology for identifying young children with internalizing disorders in the short-term, and in the long term, the ability to successfully contribute to the emerging field of digital health for the purpose of improving childhood mental health. This proposed project will advance a brief, feasible digital health approach to detect anxiety and depressive disorders in young children using wearable sensors. If successful, this approach has the potential to identify young children who are suffering with mental illness. The proposed training plan will allow this applicant to contribute significantly to the emerging field of digital psychiatry as an independent investigator as a long-term career.",Digital Phenotyping To Screen For Early Childhood Internalizing Disorders,10127012,K23MH123031,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Depressive disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Language ', ' Memory ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Moods ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' New York ', ' Parents ', ' Partnership Practice ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Phenotype ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Socialization ', ' Speech ', ' Systems Analysis ', ' Systems Analyses ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Vermont ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Competence ', ' base ', ' career ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Training ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' pediatrician ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' skills training ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' early childhood ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' disorder classification ', ' nosology ', ' disease classification ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' childhood anxiety ', ' pediatric anxiety ', ' youth anxiety ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' child depression ', ' adolescent depression ', ' adolescents with depression ', ' childhood depression ', ' childhood onset depression ', ' depressed adolescents ', ' depression in adolescence ', ' pediatric depression ', ' youth depression ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' prototype ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' evidence base ', ' screening ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile device application ', ' Social Processes ', ' Positive Valence ', ' Negative Valence ', ' cognitive process ', ' Foundational Skills ', ' recruit ', ' Mobile Health Application ', ' Mobile Health App ', ' m-Health app ', ' m-Health application ', ' mHealth app ', ' mHealth application ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable biosensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' early screening ', ' Data Scientist ', ' multimodal data ', ' multi-modal data ', ' multi-modal datasets ', ' multimodal datasets ', ' digital health ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,K23,2021,161889,VT-00
"Machine Learning Models for Identifying Neural Predictors of TMS Treatment Response in MDD Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an effective and easy-to-tolerate treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). TMS is costly and time-intensive so identifying markers of response would reduce financial and psychological burden. Further, treatment response is highly variable. Clinical and diagnostic heterogeneity of depression contributes to significant variability in neural markers of response. The literature on neural markers is complicated by variability in TMS intensity and targets, which may further modify response. Electrical field models estimate the degree to which a target is stimulated by considering both the intensity and structural information of each participant but at this time there are no studies that have investigated the association between brain electrical fields and treatment response. Moreover, the neurobiological correlates of dorsolateral (dlPFC) TMS treatment response are not well understood. Machine learning may be able to help us understand these complex set of features and their association to treatment response. Thus to appropriately personalize treatments, I will develop a data-driven machine learning model that uses the following: (1) pre- treatment resting state connectivity that reflects circuit dysregulation; (2) electrical field modeling to estimate the electrical field or voltage on individual patient’s brain, as a marker of sufficiency of stimulation; and (3) expected target network connectivity as a marker of target engagement. We have previously demonstrated feasibility of machine learning to predict antidepressant response in MDD. We will optimize and expand a model developed on archival University of Toronto data that predicted dlPFC TMS response. We will validate this externally on three sets of data: data we collect at University of Pittsburgh, archival data from Brown University, and sham TMS data. As an exploratory aim, we will identify whether our model that predicts dlPFC TMS treatment response is capable of predicting response to dmPFC TMS stimulation. During my PhD in Bioengineering, I developed kernel-based machine learning models to personalize neural networks markers of antidepressant response. Given the clinical and neural heterogeneity of depression, I will leverage my machine learning and neuroimaging experience by receiving training in advanced optimization approaches and depression neurobiology to identify stable, reproducible neural predictors of TMS treatment response to achieve clinically translatable personalized treatments. This will allow me to develop optimized models of treatment response and facilitate my long-term career goal to develop personalized treatment algorithms using large-scale data. My previous experiences in machine learning, bioengineering, neuroimaging, as well as the preliminary understanding of depression uniquely position me to maximize the benefits of training aims outlined in this proposal. 1 This is a K01 application designed to develop a data-driven machine learning model that will take into account several neural markers of response to Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). The application proposes expanded training in machine learning optimization approaches and depression neurobiology for the applicant, who has a PhD in Bioengineering. The goal of the study is to identify stable, reproducible neural predictors of TMS treatment response to achieve clinically translatable personalized treatments, which matches the candidate’s long-term goal to conduct research on and develop models that personalize medicine for depression. 1",Machine Learning Models for Identifying Neural Predictors of TMS Treatment Response in MDD,10125330,K01MH122741,"['Algorithms ', ' Antidepressive Agents ', ' Antidepressant Agent ', ' Antidepressant Drugs ', ' Antidepressants ', ' anti-depressant agent ', ' anti-depressant drugs ', ' anti-depressants ', ' anti-depressive agents ', ' Archives ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bio-engineered ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bioengineering ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Literature ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Patients ', ' Placebos ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' sham therapy ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Rewards ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Left ', ' Anterior ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' electric field ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Transcranial magnetic stimulation ', ' Complex ', ' experience ', ' voltage ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Participant ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Motor ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict treatment response ', ' therapy prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' predicting response ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' individual patient ', ' response biomarker ', ' response markers ', ' clinically translatable ', ' clinical diagnostics ', ' translational scientist ', ' translational investigator ', ' translational researcher ', ' neural network ', ' random forest ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' support vector machine ', ' archive data ', ' archiving data ', ' archived data ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K01,2021,170027,PA-18
"Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress Project Summary/Abstract Maladaptive complications following trauma, including post-traumatic stress (PTS), are highly prevalent in both veterans and civilians, and have been difficult to accurately diagnose, manage and treat. Debate regarding diagnostic criteria and the need to represent the full spectrum of inter-connected features contributing to psychopathology has spawned the development of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). RDoC is a developing framework to help guide the discovery and validation of new dimensions of mental health disorders and their relationships to underlying biological mechanisms. NIMH now has a rich federated database that currently houses raw data from RDoC-sponsored clinical research, and clinical trial data from the National Database of Clinical Trials (NDCT) with information that may help to unlock the complex and overlapping relationships between symptoms of PTS and the underlying biomarkers to fuel improvements on diagnostic and therapeutic frameworks for trauma recovery. The proposed project will apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytical tools to these large, heterogeneous datasets to identify and validate new research dimensions of trauma-related psychopathology and treatment response trajectories and their predictors. Aim 1 will develop an in silico trauma patient population by integrating data from diverse sources, including cross-sectional and observational longitudinal clinical studies housed within available data repositories for trauma and other related mental health research. Data will include medical history, demographics, diagnostic tests, clinical outcomes, psychological assessments, genomics, imaging, and other relevant study and meta-data. Aim 2 will identify multiple dimensions of PTS diagnostic criteria, using a combination of unsupervised dimension-reduction statistical methods, internal and external cross-validation, and supervised hypothesis testing of predictive models to understand the heterogeneous subtypes of PTS. Aim 3 will deploy unsupervised machine learning methods, such as topological data analysis and hierarchical clustering, to identify unique clusters of patients based on symptomatology to develop clustering methods for precision mapping of PTS patients based on disease severity. Aim 4 will use supervised machine learning techniques for targeted predictive analytics focused on identifying treatment responders from the NDCT, and identification of latent variables that predict treatment response. The results of the proposed research project will greatly enrich the field of computational psychiatry research to identify conserved dimensions associated with the complex relationships of psychopathology and precision treatment planning following exposure to traumatic events. Project Narrative A recent restructuring of diagnostic and research criteria for psychiatric disorders has been implemented to promote greater understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in the development of complex mental health disorders.

"Leveraging interactive SMS messaging to monitor and support maternal mental health in Kenya ABSTRACT Perinatal depression, defined as a depressive episode during pregnancy or in the first year postpartum, is the most common complication of childbirth, affecting up to 20% of peripartum women globally. An enormous gap exists in supporting women experiencing perinatal depression. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions such as interactive SMS text messaging with healthcare workers (HCWs) have been proposed as resource-efficient, accessible adjuncts to in-person care. Realizing the full public health potential of mHealth for mental health will require strategic use of automation and empiric definition of interventions that dynamically adapt to user needs. This K18 mentored career enhancement award aims to support Dr. Keshet Ronen, an epidemiologist with multidisciplinary training, to become an expert in analysis of mHealth communication and development of adaptive mHealth interventions. Building on Dr. Ronen’s established expertise in development and evaluation of mHealth interventions using SMS and social media, and supported by a team of experienced mentors, the following research and training aims are proposed. Training plan: Through didactic coursework, individual mentor meetings, seminars, and conferences, Dr. Ronen seeks to accomplish the following Career Enhancement Goals. (1) Gain proficiency and experience using natural language processing and machine learning methods to analyze mHealth communication. (2) Gain proficiency and experience in design of an adaptive mHealth intervention. (3) Deepen understanding of mHealth intervention design for mental health. (4) Enhance skills in international study implementation and clinical trial design. The proposed training plan will augment Dr. Ronen’s prior training and experience and allow her to complete the proposed Research plan: Mobile WACh is a unique interactive SMS messaging platform that has been shown to improve maternal-child health and whose impact on perinatal depression is currently being evaluated in a randomized controlled trial in Kenya, Mobile WACh Neo. We propose to leverage a dataset of >100,000 SMS messages with >3000 peripartum women in previous and ongoing Mobile WACh studies to (1) develop a predictive model that can detect client SMS indicating elevated depression symptoms, and (2) identify HCW message characteristics associated with improvements in depression symptoms. (3) Models from Aims 1-2 will be implemented in the Mobile WACh software to develop an adaptive version of Mobile WACh Neo that flags concerning messages and guides HCWs on SMS composition. A pilot study of Adaptive Mobile WACh Neo will be conducted, nested within the Mobile WACh Neo randomized controlled trial in Kenya (R01HD098105), to evaluate its acceptability and preliminary impact on time taken for HCWs to respond to client messages. Collectively, these activities will enable Dr. Ronen to become a leader in the study of adaptive mHealth interventions to support maternal mental health in resource-limited settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE Depression is the most common complication of pregnancy, but it is undertreated due to lack of mental healthcare resources and barriers to in-person care.

"Developing an Optimized Conversational Agent or ""Chatbot"" to Facilitate Mental Health Services Use in Individuals with Eating Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Eating disorders (EDs) are serious mental illnesses associated with high morbidity and mortality, clinical impairment, and comorbid psychopathology. Although evidence-based treatments for EDs have been established, the treatment gap is wide. Indeed, <20% of individuals with EDs receive treatment. We need a novel solution not only to identify individuals with EDs but also to encourage mental health services use and address treatment barriers. I have established a strong working relationship with the National EDs Association (NEDA), the U.S.'s leading non-profit for EDs, to offer our group's online, evidence-based EDs screen on the NEDA website. Over one year, the NEDA screen was completed >200,000 times. Among screen respondents, the vast majority screen positive for an ED, but of those, most are not in treatment, and only a small percentage click to learn more about one of the options for seeking intervention presented in the screening feedback. I propose a research agenda to design a conversational agent or “chatbot” that is optimized to increase mental health services use among individuals with EDs through such features as: 1) providing a personalized recommendation for seeking intervention; 2) engaging the user in motivational interviewing to overcome barriers to care; and 3) repeated check-ins with the user to encourage follow-up with care. This research agenda aligns with NIMH's focus on services research and interest in technology-driven approaches to promote engagement with care. I will conduct two studies. First, I will utilize a user-centered design approach to create a prototype chatbot and conduct usability testing with adults with EDs to inform chatbot refinements (Aim 1). Second, I will conduct a randomized optimization trial with adults who have completed screening on the NEDA website and screen positive for an ED but are not in treatment to determine chatbot feasibility and to generate data on the effect of the chatbot on motivation for treatment post-initial chatbot use and motivation for treatment and mental health services use at 1- and 3-month follow-ups (Aims 2 & 3). This trial will employ the Multiphase Optimization Strategy framework, using a 23 full factorial design, to randomly assign participants to a combination of the three proposed intervention components (n=8 conditions) to isolate the active ingredients. These aims support my training plan in which I will receive expert mentorship and training in: services research and implementation science (Training Goal 1); user-centered design and usability testing, as well as exposure to machine learning (Training Goal 2); novel trial designs (Training Goal 3); and advanced statistical techniques for analyzing longitudinal trial and digital innovation data (Training Goal 4). My expert mentorship team, along with the environment of Washington University, will ensure my success. Results from the proposed study will be used to optimize the chatbot, which I will then test in a subsequent R01 randomized controlled trial. This K08 will equip me with the skills to become a leader in addressing the research-practice and treatment gaps for EDs, with a focus on digital innovations.

This K08 will not only result in the development of a highly scalable solution for facilitating mental health services use among individuals with eating disorders that has potential for widespread dissemination through partnership with the National Eating Disorders Association, but it will also result in an independent research program that addresses critical gaps in the treatment of eating disorders, with a focus on digital innovation solutions.","Developing an Optimized Conversational Agent or ""Chatbot"" to Facilitate Mental Health Services Use in Individuals with Eating Disorders",10170441,K08MH120341,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' computer program ', ' computer programming ', ' Eating Disorders ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' services research ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mentorship ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Partnership Practice ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Recommendation ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Support ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Caring ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Respondent ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' motivational interview ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Experimental Therapies ', ' Investigational Treatments ', ' experimental therapeutic agents ', ' experimental therapeutics ', ' Investigational Therapies ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' severe mental illness ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' user centered design ', ' usability ', ' implementation science ', ' prototype ', ' evidence base ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' screening ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' trial design ', ' health service use ', ' health service utilization ', ' Text Messaging ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' barrier to care ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' service delivery ', ' Facebook ', ' chatbot ', ' chat bot ', ' multiphase optimization strategy ', ' digital health ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K08,2021,179096,MO-01
"The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning - Project Summary. This project explores how humans learn at multiple hierarchical levels in parallel, and how this supports human intelligence. Human decisions are typically hierarchically structured: we make high-level decisions (making a cup of coffee), which constrain lower level decisions (grinding coffee beans, boiling water, etc.), which themselves constrain simpler and simpler decisions and motor actions. This hierarchy in decisions is paralleled by a hierarchy in our representation of our environment: some sensory signals trigger simple decisions (a red light signals a stop), while other signal a broader, more abstract behavioral change (rain signals a set of adaptations when driving). Thus, complex hierarchical structure underlies the way we respond to our environment in seemingly simple, everyday tasks. This ability is supported by the prefrontal cortex, which represents states and decisions at multiple degrees of hierarchical abstraction. My previous work shows that hierarchical representations support transfer and generalization while learning, an ability that artificial agents still struggle to match human performance in. However, how we learn to form these hierarchical representations is poorly understood, despite how crucial it is for human intelligence. The proposed work will examine how multiple, parallel hierarchical loops between prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia support reinforcement learning at multiple hierarchical levels in parallel, and how this promotes flexible behavior. To this end, we will address three aims: 1. We will show that the same reinforcement learning computations happen in parallel at multiple levels of abstraction, as hypothesized by our computational model of prefrontal- subcortical networks. 2. We will demonstrate that humans partition learning problems into multiple sequential subgoals so they can learn multiple simple strategies instead of one complex strategy, and that reusing these simple strategies promotes fast exploration and learning. 3. We will show that hierarchical learning does not rely exclusively on rewards, but that novelty signals are crucial for identifying subgoals and learning through curiosity. Across all three aims, we will use behavioral experiments in conjunction with computational modeling to characterize how humans learn hierarchically. In addition, we will use EEG and fMRI to identify the neural computations underlying the cognitive systems inferred from behavior and modeling. This project will provide new insights into the computational mechanisms that give rise to learning, and thus provide a better handle on the sources of learning dysfunction observed in many psychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, ADHD, and OCD. Additionally, it will provide new tools, in the form of experimental protocols and precise computational models, for studying learning across populations and species. Project Narrative This proposal will explore how learning hierarchically structured representations of our environments helps humans adapt flexibly and efficiently to new situations. We will record how people learn to make simple decisions, observe changes in brain activity, and use mathematical models to study how hierarchical learning happens in the brain. This will help explain how human learning can be so efficient and flexible, how mental conditions such as schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety cause learning and decision-making impairments, and will help develop better treatments.",The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning,10113371,R01MH119383,"['Anxiety ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Basal Ganglia ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' bean ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Coffee ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Curiosities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dopamine ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Environment ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Intelligence ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Play ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Rain ', ' rainfall ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Work ', ' Experimental Models ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' Anterior ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' tool ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Sensory ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Performance ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' AD/HD ', ' ADHD ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Impairment ', ' cognitive system ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' learning algorithm ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2021,380647,CA-13
"Passive mobile sensing and machine learning for the detection of drinking episodes PROJECT SUMMARY  Ambulatory assessment (AA) techniques (e.g., ecological momentary assessment, daily diaries, experiencing sampling) have provided critical tests of theories about the development of alcohol use disorder (AUD) by identifying within-person processes (such as negative or reinforcement, stress exposure, or social context) that can raise the risk for problem drinking and in turn AUD. AA methods are the leading methodological approach in the push towards personalized medicine because it provides a compelling platform for assessment, diagnosis, real-time monitoring, and just-in-time interventions. However, the current utility of AA for personalized models of AUD risk is limited because risky drinking and the risk factors for it (such as changes in moods, stress, or social contexts) change at different scales of time. In other words, even heavy drinkers may only drink a few times a week, but their emotions, stressors and social contexts change multiple times a day. Current AA methods that rely on self-report data have to sample frequently enough to be sensitive to change, long enough to observe sufficient drinking episodes, and to do so while avoiding participant burnout. Passive mobile sensing, which uses sensors (such as GPS, accelerometer, light meter, etc.) available on most smartphones, has been shown in preliminary studies to predict the probability of drinking episodes, but those studies have used relatively small samples. The present career development award aims to develop the candidate’s expertise in passive mobile sensing and the machine learning methods used to analyze passive mobile sensing data. The research proposal will analyze passive mobile sensing data collected in a large sample of regular drinking and marijuana using young adults (age 18 – 22, n = 500; 95.2% who drink), who will be followed using AA over 8 successive weekends as part of a parent R01 (DA 047247). The research goal is to identify passive mobile sensing models of risk factors for drinking (stress, social contexts, sleep, mood, and impulsive states), as well as the drinking episodes themselves. The candidate will develop expertise in these methods and models that will further the development of a research program aimed at developing person specific models of risk for AUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE The career development plan will develop expertise of the investigator in the collection and analysis of passive mobile sensing data, with an emphasis on the application of machine learning methods. The proposed research study will use passive mobile sensing data in a large ambulatory assessment sample of regular drinkers, to develop models linking passive mobile sensing data with predictors of drinking episodes (such as stress, social context, and impulsiveness) and the drinking episodes themselves.",Passive mobile sensing and machine learning for the detection of drinking episodes,10102612,K02AA028832,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' alcohol use disorder ', ' ethanol use disorder ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Algorithms ', ' Award ', ' Consultations ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Emotions ', ' Goals ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mining ', ' Moods ', ' Persons ', ' Parents ', ' Probability ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sleep ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Stress ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Alcohol abuse ', ' EtOH abuse ', ' alcohol co-abuse ', ' alcohol problem ', ' ethanol abuse ', ' hazardous alcohol use ', ' problem alcohol use ', ' problem drinking ', ' problematic alcohol consumption ', ' problematic alcohol use ', ' Data Security ', ' Data awareness ', ' information security ', ' analytical method ', ' sensor ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Fostering ', ' Logistics ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Heavy Drinker ', ' Alcoholic beverage heavy drinker ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' diaries ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' meter ', ' burn-out ', ' burnout ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Participant ', ' research study ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' drinking ', ' drink heavily ', ' excessive alcohol consumption ', ' excessive alcohol ingestion ', ' excessive alcohol intake ', ' excessive drinking ', ' excessive ethanol ingestion ', ' extreme drinking ', ' heavy alcohol use ', ' Heavy Drinking ', ' Reporting ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' K02 Award ', ' Independent Scientist Award ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' Collection ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' high risk drinking ', ' at-risk drinking ', ' risky drinking ', ' Population ', ' drinking behavior ', ' open source ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' alcohol risk ', ' marijuana user ', ' cannabis user ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' marijuana use ', ' THC co-use ', ' THC use ', ' Tetrahydrocannabinol co-use ', ' Tetrahydrocannabinol use ', ' cannabis use ', ' temporal measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' Accelerometer ', ' accelerometry ', ' activity monitor ', ' activity tracker ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' Text Messaging ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' real time monitoring ', ' realtime monitoring ', ' data streams ', ' feature selection ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' ']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K02,2021,142338,WA-07
"Impact of Telemedicine on Medicare Beneficiaries with Mental Illness PROJECT SUMMARY Access to mental health specialists is difficult for many patients in the U.S., particularly for the poor and those who live in rural communities. Telemental health is one potential solution for this access problem, and there has been rapid growth in the number of live video-based telemental health visits in the U.S. While there are numerous rigorous randomized-control trials comparing telemental health visits to in-person mental health specialist care, there have been little research on how telemental health is being used in real-world settings. The uptake of telemental health has been very uneven geographically, and what explains this variation is also largely unknown. Our mixed-methods proposal centers on filling these gaps in knowledge. Under the first aim, we will conduct a series of descriptive analyses of data on 75 million adults with Medicare or commercial insurance to understand how telemental health is being used in conjunction with in-person care and whether the growth of telemental health has decreased disparities in the use of mental health specialists among disadvantaged populations. Under the second aim, we seek to explain why there is geographic variation in uptake using robust statistical machine learning. Under the third aim, we exploit the variation in uptake to assess whether communities with greater telemental health penetration have experienced improvements in care for patients with mental illness. In the fourth aim we will conduct qualitative interviews with providers to complement the empirical analyses and understand the key contextual factors underlying our findings. Understanding how telemental health is being used, why there is variation in use of telemental health, and whether telemental health use is associated with higher quality care could help drive future telemental health interventions and influence the ongoing policy debate on telemedicine regulations and reimbursement. Together the results of these aims are consistent with the NIMH's expressed interest in innovative delivery models that can improve care for underserved communities. It is difficult for many patients with mental illness to access care from a mental health specialist. Telemental health is one way to potentially help these patients receive care and the number of such visits for mental illness has increased rapidly. In this project, we will study how telemental health is being used to care for patients with mental illness, what drives variation in use, and whether telemedicine is associated with receipt of higher quality care.",Impact of Telemedicine on Medicare Beneficiaries with Mental Illness,10063830,R01MH112829,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Congresses ', ' meeting reports ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diffusion ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Geography ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Handicapped ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' disabled ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled people ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' Laws ', ' Literature ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Patients ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Research ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Rural Community ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' Telemedicine ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' rural location ', ' rural region ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Penetration ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Rural ', ' Policies ', ' uptake ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' video chat ', ' video conferencing ', ' Videoconferencing ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' trend ', ' beneficiary ', ' medication compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' rapid growth ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' severe mental illness ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' trial comparing ', ' demographics ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' control trial ', ' population health ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' improved outcome ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' Telemental ', ' Telemental health ', ' care costs ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' underserved community ', ' under served community ', ' ']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2021,643165,MA-07
"Predicting populations at-risk of developing pathological hoarding ABSTRACT Hoarding Disorder (HD), recognized as an independent illness in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders for less than a decade, is a debilitating psychiatric disorder with profound socioeconomic impacts. Emerging data shows that hoarding severity correlates with substantial medical burden. Prevalence of clinically significant hoarding behavior is estimated to be between 2 and 4%, with a higher burden in the older population. However, it is believed that hoarding disorder is underdiagnosed. The parent R01MH117114 combines in-person clinical, neuropsychological, and medical frailty assessments with a unique epidemiologic resource, the online Brain Health Registry (BHR) 17, to assess the extent of disability in older adults suffering with hoarding symptoms. To date, over 24,000 subjects have taken hoarding-related questionnaires. In addition, 1554 participants have completed additional surveys performed for validation of hoarding symptoms. Moreover, the BHR includes longitudinal objective and subjective measures of cognition, as well as childhood and medical history. We will classify longitudinal trends of measures of hoarding symptomatology in a subpopulation of the BHR with clinical assessments of hoarding disorders and other psychopathologies. We will then project the whole BHR population to classify longitudinal trends. We will then apply statistical inference and techniques from artificial intelligence to identify predictors of various trends of hoarding symptomatology to find predictors of developing severe hoarding symptoms. Ongoing recruitment through the parent R01 will allow for validation of the predictions made through this work. Moreover, as there is a rapid increase in the number of psychiatric studies using web-based data collection methods rather than in-person clinical assessments, the importance of studying the temporal trends and fidelity of these data collection methods extends beyond the scope of the current study. The present study will provide a proof-of-concept approach for analyzing such data.  The work will be carried out by a trained mathematician transitioning into systems medicine whose career goal is to establish an independent career in the field of computational psychiatry. The training provided through this grant will prepare the supplement candidate to submit an independent K01 award on the interactions between late life depression and hoarding disorder to the National Institute of Mental Health. This will be done by providing tailored mentoring by experts in hoarding disorder and systems medicine, access to unique datasets related to various psychopathologies, structured training in grant writing and responsible conduct in research, a structured course in psychopathology, and premier computational resources at the University of Florida. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hoarding Disorder (HD) is a debilitating psychiatric disorder with profound socioeconomic impacts characterized by difficulty discarding seemingly worthless objects.

"Electrophysiological Biomarkers to Optimize DBS for Depression PROJECT SUMMARY Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate (SCC) white matter is an emerging new treatment strategy for treatment resistant depression (TRD) with published studies demonstrating sustained long-term antidepressant effects in 40-60% of implanted patients. Converging evidence from positron emission tomography (PET), electroencephalography (EEG) and diffusion tractography (DTI) strongly suggests that DBS mediates its clinical benefits by direct modulation of the SCC--a key hub in an aberrant neural circuit. Despite encouraging sustained long-term effects in this notoriously difficult to treat patient population, randomized controls trials of SCC DBS and other DBS targets for TRD are now on hold as initial results failed to meet predefined clinical endpoints. While this proposal cannot address those failures directly, a clear necessary next step for effective future testing and eventual dissemination of this treatment is the need to develop brain-based biomarkers to guide lead placement and to titrate stimulation parameters during ongoing care. In the absence of such biomarkers to guide DBS use, there will continue to be variability in the implementation of clinical procedures during testing, leading to ambiguous and possibly misleading trial outcomes, and subsequent abandonment of a potentially useful treatment. To overcome these limitations, we propose to develop and test objective methods for reliable device configuration in individuals by optimizing DBS-SCC treatment with respect to human functional anatomy and key electrophysiological variables. We will leverage the capabilities of a novel bi-directional neuromodulation system (Medtronic RC+S) that allows live streaming of oscillatory activity at the site of stimulation to define novel control strategies to guide programming decisions for DBS delivery. Ongoing measurements of SCC local field potentials (LFPs) will be combined with electroencephalography (EEG) and event related potential studies (ERP) performed as part of an experimental clinical trial of subcallosal cingulate DBS for TRD to identify an oscillatory signal that (1) is sensitive to changes in frequency and current parameters at the tractography defined optimal target and (2) tracks with depression state over time. Connectome-based and machine learning approaches will be used to define the most robust network biomarker and its response characteristics. Once defined, the control policy will be tested in a second phase feasibility study where parameters for initial stimulation will be selected based on the depression brain state biomarker and adjustments made to correct drift from the predefined target signal. If successful, the data- driven model and control strategy will enable objective, rational clinical programming of DBS stimulation for depression and provide a new model and approach for target identification, stimulation initiation and long-term monitoring and management of patients receiving this treatment. . NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to refine and optimize deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate white matter for patients with treatment resistant depression. Using a newly available bi- directional neuromodulation system that allows live streaming of oscillatory activity at the site of stimulation, this study will define novel control strategies to guide programming decisions for DBS delivery providing a new evidence-based strategy for target identification, stimulation initiation and long-term monitoring and management of patients receiving this treatment.",Electrophysiological Biomarkers to Optimize DBS for Depression,10310774,UH3NS103550,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diffusion ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' PET ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET imaging ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PETT ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' Publishing ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Event-Related Potentials ', ' event related potential ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Deep Brain Stimulation ', ' Frequencies ', ' System ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' novel ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Devices ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Outcome ', ' Implant ', ' control trial ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' treatment strategy ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' treatment-resistant depression ', ' treatment-refractory depression ', ' antidepressant effect ', ' anti-depressant effect ', ' connectome ', ' tractography ', ' clinical implementation ', ' live stream ', ' livestream ', ' ']",NINDS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,UH3,2021,109980,NY-13
"Developing an Optimized Conversational Agent or ""Chatbot"" to Facilitate Mental Health Services Use in Individuals with Eating Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Eating disorders (EDs) are serious mental illnesses associated with high morbidity and mortality, clinical impairment, and comorbid psychopathology. Although evidence-based treatments for EDs have been established, the treatment gap is wide. Indeed, <20% of individuals with EDs receive treatment. We need a novel solution not only to identify individuals with EDs but also to encourage mental health services use and address treatment barriers. I have established a strong working relationship with the National EDs Association (NEDA), the U.S.’s leading non-profit for EDs, to offer our group’s online, evidence-based EDs screen on the NEDA website. Over one year, the NEDA screen was completed >200,000 times. Among screen respondents, the vast majority screen positive for an ED, but of those, most are not in treatment, and only a small percentage click to learn more about one of the options for seeking intervention presented in the screening feedback. I propose a research agenda to design a conversational agent or “chatbot” that is optimized to increase mental health services use among individuals with EDs through such features as: 1) providing a personalized recommendation for seeking intervention; 2) engaging the user in motivational interviewing to overcome barriers to care; and 3) repeated check-ins with the user to encourage follow-up with care. This research agenda aligns with NIMH’s focus on services research and interest in technology-driven approaches to promote engagement with care. I will conduct two studies. First, I will utilize a user-centered design approach to create a prototype chatbot and conduct usability testing with adults with EDs to inform chatbot refinements (Aim 1). Second, I will conduct a randomized optimization trial with adults who have completed screening on the NEDA website and screen positive for an ED but are not in treatment to determine chatbot feasibility and to generate data on the effect of the chatbot on motivation for treatment post-initial chatbot use and motivation for treatment and mental health services use at 1- and 3-month follow-ups (Aims 2 & 3). This trial will employ the Multiphase Optimization Strategy framework, using a 23 full factorial design, to randomly assign participants to a combination of the three proposed intervention components (n=8 conditions) to isolate the active ingredients. These aims support my training plan in which I will receive expert mentorship and training in: services research and implementation science (Training Goal 1); user-centered design and usability testing, as well as exposure to machine learning (Training Goal 2); novel trial designs (Training Goal 3); and advanced statistical techniques for analyzing longitudinal trial and digital innovation data (Training Goal 4). My expert mentorship team, along with the environment of Washington University, will ensure my success. Results from the proposed study will be used to optimize the chatbot, which I will then test in a subsequent R01 randomized controlled trial. This K08 will equip me with the skills to become a leader in addressing the research-practice and treatment gaps for EDs, with a focus on digital innovations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Eating disorders are serious mental illnesses, but less than 20% of individuals receive treatment. I propose a research agenda to design a conversational agent or “chatbot” for increasing mental health services use among individuals with eating disorders, with study data being used to optimize the chatbot for a subsequent R01 randomized controlled trial. This K08 will not only result in the development of a highly scalable solution for facilitating mental health services use among individuals with eating disorders that has potential for widespread dissemination through partnership with the National Eating Disorders Association, but it will also result in an independent research program that addresses critical gaps in the treatment of eating disorders, with a focus on digital innovation solutions.","Developing an Optimized Conversational Agent or ""Chatbot"" to Facilitate Mental Health Services Use in Individuals with Eating Disorders",10305163,K08MH120341,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' computer program ', ' computer programming ', ' Eating Disorders ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' services research ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mentorship ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Partnership Practice ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Recommendation ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Support ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Caring ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Respondent ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' motivational interview ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Experimental Therapies ', ' Investigational Treatments ', ' experimental therapeutic agents ', ' experimental therapeutics ', ' Investigational Therapies ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' severe mental illness ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' user centered design ', ' usability ', ' implementation science ', ' prototype ', ' evidence base ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' screening ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' trial design ', ' health service use ', ' health service utilization ', ' Text Messaging ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' barrier to care ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' service delivery ', ' Facebook ', ' chatbot ', ' chat bot ', ' multiphase optimization strategy ', ' digital health ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K08,2021,54000,MO-01
"Telehealth 2.0: Evaluating effectiveness and engagement strategies for asynchronous texting based trauma focused therapy for PTSD The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated mental health challenges for trauma-exposed individuals due to increased isolation, insufficient capacity in the mental health workforce, and a predicted fourth wave of mental health impacts of the pandemic itself [1,2]. There is a pressing need to increase treatment capacity for individuals with trauma-related mental health problems directly related to or exacerbated by the pandemic [6]. Digital mental health (DMH) interventions for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) address well-documented barriers to traditional in-person psychotherapy or telehealth delivery of evidence-based treatments (EBTs) for PTSD, but many consumers do not remain engaged [7]. Thus, acceptable, efficient, and engaging forms of EBTs are sorely needed, particularly for those who are less likely to access traditional psychotherapy or use online programs. Asynchronous texting therapy platforms may facilitate treatment engagement among those who seek discrete, convenient, and affordable support [9]. In our pilot of a texting-based format of an EBT for PTSD, Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT-Text), we found CPT-Text was feasible to deliver, and clients showed substantially greater PTSD symptom improvement over a shorter time compared to text therapy as usual (TAU) [5,6]. A larger scale, more rigorous test is necessary. Additional refinement also is needed to address challenges to sustained engagement that were identified both in the pilot and more broadly in other DMH interventions. We propose a randomized, Hybrid Type 1, implementation-effectiveness trial with a factorial design to compare text-based therapies for PTSD utilizing the HIPAA-compliant secure texting platform of our DMH partner, Talkspace. We will randomize participants (N= 400) who have PTSD that is related to or has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic into CPT-Text or text-based TAU. Participants will also be randomized into one of two engagement strategies: therapist reminder as usual (RAU) or RAU + incentive (RI). We will examine an innovative incentive structure in which participants who remain engaged in the intervention will have the option of retaining their introductory discount or donating it to individuals in need of financial support. We will compare the impact of engagement strategy on treatment response and engagement, and we will examine motivation as a potential mechanism. We also will evaluate a novel Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach to assessing CPT-Text fidelity. This study will be conducted by a team with expertise in PTSD treatment, DMH, biostatistics, marketing, and implementation. It aligns with PAR-20- 243 by focusing on text-based interventions for PTSD related to or exacerbated by the COVID pandemic. It also has a well-established DMH partner to increase reach of and access to EBTs in response to the growing needs created by the pandemic. This study will (1) provide critical information about how to promote sustained DMH engagement using unique incentive strategies and moderators of engagement and outcomes and (2) offer first guidance on supporting quality and fidelity of messaging-based EBTs using NLP. Project Narrative There is a pressing need to increase capacity to treat PTSD related to or exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Texting-based therapy holds promise to increase capacity and reduce barriers to delivering evidence-based treatments (EBTs), but ongoing engagement in digital mental health interventions is low. This study will compare a texting-based EBT for PTSD to texting-based treatment as usual, and it will also compare a unique incentive strategy to typical platform reminders aimed to prevent early discontinuation in therapy.",Telehealth 2.0: Evaluating effectiveness and engagement strategies for asynchronous texting based trauma focused therapy for PTSD,10362027,RF1MH128785,"['Anxiety ', '

"Enhancing the quality of CBT in community mental health through AI-generated fidelity feedback Each year, millions of Americans receive evidence-based psychotherapies (EBPs) such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for the treatment of mental and behavioral health problems. Yet, at present, there is no scalable method for evaluating the quality of psychotherapy services. In research settings, human-based behavioral coding methods are used, but these are time consuming, costly, and rarely used in real-world clinical settings. Thus, EBP quality and effectiveness is unmeasured and unknown. The current, fast-track STTR proposal will develop and evaluate an AI-based software system (LyssnCBT) that will automatically estimate CBT fidelity from an audio recording of a CBT session. Importantly, the current work builds from Lyssn’s previous, successful work in developing an automated system for evaluating motivational interviewing (MI), and previous research showing that AI algorithms can accurately estimate CBT fidelity.  Lyssn.io, Inc., (“Lyssn”) is a start-up developing AI-based technologies to support training, supervision, and quality assurance of evidence-based counseling. Our goal is to develop innovative health technology solutions that are objective, scalable, and cost efficient. Lyssn offers a HIPAA-compliant, cloud-based platform for secure recording, sharing, and reviewing of therapy sessions, which includes AI-generated metrics for MI. The proposed LyssnCBT tool will build from and be integrated into this core platform. Lyssn is partnering with Dr. Torrey Creed and the Penn Collaborative, which has a 14+ year track record of gold-standard CBT training and supervision, including more than 100 community agencies with almost 900 providers. The expertise, relationships, and amassed data -- more than 8,000 recorded sessions and more than 3,000 rated for CBT fidelity -- form the clinical foundation for the current research.  Phase I will work from an existing AI-CBT prototype to develop LyssnCBT. Core activities include user-centered design focus groups and interviews with community mental health (CMH) therapists, supervisors, and administrators, which will inform the design and development of LyssnCBT. LyssnCBT will be evaluated for usability and implementation readiness in a final stage of Phase I. Phase II will conduct a field-based usability trial and a stepped-wedge, hybrid implementation-effectiveness randomized trial (N = 1,850 CMH clients) to evaluate the effectiveness of LyssnCBT to improve therapist CBT skills and client outcomes, and to reduce client drop-out. Analyses will also examine the hypothesized mechanism of action underlying LyssnCBT.  The research is strongly aligned with NIMH’s 2020 Strategic Plan and its emphasis on a computational approach to scaling up treatment delivery and monitoring. Successful execution will provide automated, scalable CBT fidelity feedback for the first time ever, supporting high-quality training, supervision, and quality assurance, and providing a core technology foundation that could support a range of EBPs in the future. PROJECT NARRATIVE Evidence-based psychotherapies such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) are increasingly emphasized in professional practice guidelines, taught in training programs, sought out by consumers, and valued by payers. Yet, at present, there is no scalable method for evaluating CBT fidelity to support training, supervision, and quality assurance in community practice settings. The current study will develop and evaluate a clinical support software tool (LyssnCBT) that uses speech signal processing and machine learning to automate CBT fidelity and support high-quality CBT supervision and service delivery in community settings.",Enhancing the quality of CBT in community mental health through AI-generated fidelity feedback,10324974,R42MH128101,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Client ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' Communities ', ' Counseling ', ' Dropout ', ' Engineering ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Group Interviews ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Professional Practice ', ' health care professional practice ', ' healthcare professional practice ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Science ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Speech ', ' Standardization ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Training Support ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Administrator ', ' Practice Guidelines ', ' base ', ' quality assurance ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Policies ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' tech development ', ' technology development ', ' HIPAA ', ' Kennedy Kassebaum Act ', ' PL 104-191 ', ' PL104-191 ', ' Public Law 104-191 ', ' United States Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ', ' Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ', ' skills ', ' motivational interview ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' Reporting ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' behavioral health ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Provider ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' telehealth ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Community Practice ', ' Small Business Technology Transfer Research ', ' STTR ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' software systems ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' cost efficient ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' speech processing ', ' user centered design ', ' usability ', ' implementation science ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' therapeutic development ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' symptomatic improvement ', ' improve symptom ', ' symptom improvement ', ' cognitive enhancement ', ' Secure ', ' signal processing ', ' cloud based ', ' phase II trial ', ' phase 2 trial ', ' cloud platform ', ' cloud server ', ' software as a service ', ' dashboard ', ' service delivery ', ' practice setting ', ' randomized effectiveness trial ', ' effectiveness implementation study ', ' effectiveness implementation hybrid ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' services as usual ', ' ']",NIMH,"LYSSN.IO, INC.",R42,2021,459739,WA-07
"Immunometabolicgene expression profiles associated with depressed mood and behavioral domains inpeople with HIV SUMMARY This project will leverage emerging knowledge about the role of immunometabolism in the pathophysiology of depression in people with HIV to generate hypotheses about potential future treatments. Depression in PWH is characterized by features that differentiate it from depression in people without HIV (PWoH). The first is the predominance of anhedonia - inability to gain enjoyment from activities. The second is a higher prevalence of depression that is resistant to treatment with standard antidepressant drugs in PWH versus PWoH. These clinical observations suggest not only that the underlying pathophysiology of depression is different between the two populations, but that different treatments are needed to successfully treat depression in PWH. Molecular studies of immunometabolism, defined as reciprocal interactions between immunity and metabolism that are dysregulated and linked to depression in PWH, support these distinctions. Based on our preliminary data and that in the literature, we propose to perform RNA-Seq transcriptomics, relating immunometabolic gene expression to protein and other biomarkers of immunometabolism, and to clinical depression as well as to cognitive processes impacted by depression. Our hypothesis-driven approach will focus on two interacting, co-regulated gene pathways central to depression and immunometabolism, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and the NLRP3 inflammasome. We will study 80 newly recruited PWH and 40 age- matched PWoH. Given our early work suggesting that the relationship between immunometabolism and depression is sex-dependent, we aim for a 50/50 breakdown of men and premenopausal women in order to examine sex differences in these relationships. To optimize the spectrum of depressive symptom severity in our sample (e.g., avoid over-representation of individuals with minimal depressive symptoms), we will stratify with a 50/50 breakdown above and below the previously established Beck Depression Inventory-II cut-score for clinically-significant depressive symptoms (≥16). Since clinical studies cannot rigorously establish mechanistic relationships, we will study in parallel the roles of mTOR and NLRP3 inflammasome signaling in depression-like behaviors in a mouse model of HIV infection, EcoHIV, which expresses seven of nine key human HIV proteins. These pathways will be dissected using mTOR and NLRP3 inhibitors. Also, in these animals we will characterize immunometabolic markers in brain tissue, presumably the substrate of depression. NARRATIVE Depression remains common in people with HIV (PWH) despite viral suppression; it has important adverse consequences including poor engagement in HIV care and poor health-related quality of life, and it is often treatment resistant. We will characterize specific gene pathways relevant to depression, potentially leading to future treatments for depression in PWH.",Immunometabolicgene expression profiles associated with depressed

"Temperamental emotionality in preschoolers and depression risk PROJECT SUMMARY Depressive disorders (DD) are one of the most prevalent forms of mental disorders, and are associated with significant mortality, morbidity, and economic costs. The incidence of DD begins to increase in early-mid adolescence and peaks in emerging adulthood. The Stony Brook Temperament Study is a longitudinal study that seeks to identify early behavioral and neural precursors and risk factors for DD and understand the neurobiological and psychosocial processes through which these early manifestations develop into clinically significant psychopathology. We initially assessed a large community sample of 3-year old children, and have followed them at 3-year intervals through age 15. This competing renewal application seeks to re-evaluate the sample at ages 18 and 21. Specifically, we propose to trace pathways from laboratory observations of temperamental low positive emotionality and high negative emotionality at age 3 to neural indices of emotional and social information processing and DD symptoms and onsets from middle childhood through emerging adulthood. In addition, we seek to understand how life stress over the lifespan and the developmental challenges of emerging adulthood contribute to risk for DD, and to examine the specificity of these risk pathways in comparison with anxiety and substance use disorders. Finally, we will use cutting-edge machine learning techniques to maximize prediction of DD and understand which domains and developmental periods contribute most to prediction. This information about risk pathways and processes should contribute to understanding when and how to intervene in order to prevent DD and limit their progression.

"Construal level as a novel pathway for affect regulation and cancer control 7. Project Summary/Abstract Lung cancer is the leading major cause of preventable death in the United States, and cigarette smoking is a contributor to lung cancer in 80%–90% of cases. Though adult cigarette smoking rates have declined substantially during the past 50 years, they remain as high as 30% in certain groups, such as individuals living in poverty. Quitting is difficult: a given quit attempt results in cessation in fewer than 10% of cases, and most adult cigarette smokers have attempted and failed to quit, and often many times. What is urgently needed are novel interventions for cigarette smoking cessation that operate through different mechanisms from those targeted by existing interventions, which are likely to have been unsuccessful for persistent smokers. A barrier to progress is that the mechanisms of action of most treatments are not known, which makes it difficult to know which treatment will work best for whom. We turn to affective science to identify a candidate technique that could serve as the basis for a novel intervention. Research on affect regulation typically focuses on down- regulation of affective states, such as craving for cigarettes, using effortful strategies such as cognitive reappraisal. However, a new insight in affect regulation is that people can construe, or subjectively understand, events with varying levels of abstraction, and that construing health-related behaviors in high- versus low-level terms promotes health behavior in several domains. For example, smokers who want to quit are more likely to resist a cigarette when they construe the same event (e.g., “abstinence”) in more abstract, high-level terms (e.g., “becoming a better me”) versus more concrete, low-level terms (e.g., “not smoking this cigarette”). There is some evidence that high-level construal might rely on distinct mechanisms from traditional affect regulation and smoking reduction interventions, but its mechanisms of action are unknown. Directly comparing its mechanisms to those of alternative affect regulation strategies and developing tools to induce high-level construal are the next steps on the path toward developing a novel intervention. Also, establishing individual differences in the effects of high-level construal will allow future interventions to be targeted to the individuals for whom they will be maximally effective. We identified two candidate mechanisms through which high-level construal might operate: down-regulation of craving and up-regulation of goal energization (i.e., motivation to quit). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) revealed the neural systems engaged by those processes to be distinct. So, we will use multivariate analyses of fMRI data to quantify the similarity of high-level construal to each candidate (Aim 1). This will be done in a longitudinal translational experiment with 4 conditions—high- level construal, down-regulation of craving, up-regulation of goal energization, and treatment-as-usual—in a sample of persistent smokers in poverty, who are the most likely to benefit from a novel, theory-based treatment. The sample size (N = 240) affords an examination of individual differences in the effect of high-level construal on neural activity and craving, and the degree to which they predict smoking reduction (Aim 2). 8. Project Narrative Cigarette smoking is among the leading causes of preventable death in the United States because smoking increases risk for lung cancer and various diseases. Though U.S. smoking rates have declined, a substantial percentage of adults, particularly those living in poverty who have repeatedly tried and failed to quit, still smoke and therefore could benefit from novel interventions for cessation that operate through different mechanisms than those of traditional treatments. This study will use neuroimaging to uncover the mechanisms of action of a promising strategy for affect regulation and smoking cessation and also build profiles of individuals for whom this strategy does and does not work, thereby providing tangible and practical information that public health professionals and clinicians can use to inform personalized treatments for cigarette smoking cessation.",Construal level as a novel pathway for affect regulation and cancer control,10127602,R01CA240452,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Down-Regulation ', ' Downregulation ', ' Fire - disasters ', ' Fires ', ' fire ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Motivation ', ' Multivariate Analysis ', ' Multivariate Analyses ', ' Persons ', ' Poverty ', ' Impoverished ', ' Psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Triage ', ' United States ', ' Up-Regulation ', ' Upregulation ', ' Work ', ' smoking cessation ', ' cease smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' stop smoking ', ' base ', ' Lateral ', ' Medial ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Personality Traits ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' cigarette use ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' lung cancer ', ' Sample Size ', ' tool ', ' Smoker ', ' Cigarette Smoker ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' fighting ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Cigarette ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' neural function ', ' Neurophysiology - biologic function ', ' Regulation ', ' Sampling ', ' craving ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Process ', ' Health Professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' tobacco control ', ' cost ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Individual Differences ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Affective ', ' Abstinence ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' arm ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' cognitive process ', ' cognitive reappraisal ', ' cognitive regulation ', ' personalized strategies ', ' individualized strategies ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' preventable death ', ' preventable mortality ', ' cigarette craving ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2021,595543,OR-04

"Dual Mechanisms of Cognitive Control This project focuses on understanding the psychological and neural mechanisms that give rise to cognitive control. Cognitive control processes are a component of human mental function that is fundamentally important in a wide range of domains, including attention, working memory, episodic memory, and decision making. Cognitive control disruptions are thought to be a major source of functional impairment for individuals suffering from a variety of mental health disorders and neuropsychiatric diseases, which is why they feature prominently in the NIMH RDoC matrix. Over the last decade, we have developed a theoretically coherent and mechanistic model, the Dual Mechanisms of Control (DMC) framework, which has the following core tenets: 1) cognitive control can operate in distinct modes, proactive and reactive; 2) these modes are associated with unique dynamic neural signatures, involving a shift between sustained and transient engagement of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and its interactions with the cingulo-opercular network (CON) and fronto-striatal circuitry; 3) they represent a core dimension of variability, present across a range of cognitive domains (i.e., indicating a psychologically coherent construct); 4) this variability is both state-related (and thus affected by task/situation and endogenous factors) and trait-related (a key component of individual variation); and 5) the variation encompasses cognitive control function in healthy young adults, but also in more extreme forms, contributes to dysfunction present in various impaired populations (e.g., schizophrenia, depression, ADHD, aging). Under a current MERIT award, we have been directly testing these core tenets of the DMC framework, through a large-scale project, which samples monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs and participants from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and to comprehensively characterize proactive and reactive control at the behavioral, neural, and genetic levels. The current proposal takes full advantage of the extensive infrastructure we have already developed for this project to dramatically expand its scope, explanatory depth, and utility to the scientific community. Specifically, we propose a rigorous, multi-pronged study, that integrates our optimized cognitive control task battery with mindfulness skills training (MT), a longitudinal design with repeated neuroimaging assessments, comprehensive “neuro-psychometric” characterization of individual variation utilizing state-of-the-art analytic techniques, and incorporation of current best practices (i.e., following Open Science Framework [OSF] recommendations), to maximize the transparency, reproducibility, and ease of dissemination of project tools and findings. Success is in this effort will have important theoretical and clinical implications, by providing a clearer understanding of the sources of normal human variation, and even more importantly, highlighting potential risk vulnerability factors for a range of mental health disorders. This project will provide detailed information regarding the brain-basis of normal human variation in higher mental functions such as attention, memory and decision-making, and how such functions are impacted by positive lifestyle interventions (i.e., mindfulness training). This information has high relevance for public health by furthering our understanding of the relationship between mental health and illness (e.g.,  schizophrenia, depression) and of the vulnerability and protective factors that contribute to mental illness risk.",Dual Mechanisms of Cognitive Control,10143063,R37MH066078,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communities ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Decision Making ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Recommendation ', ' Risk ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Standardization ', ' Task Performances ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Twin Multiple Birth ', ' Twins ', ' Monozygotic twins ', ' Identical Twins ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' analytical method ', ' Anterior ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Nonlinear Dynamics ', ' Non-linear Dynamic ', ' Non-linear Dynamics ', ' Nonlinear Dynamic ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Dimensions ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' Equation ', ' skills training ', ' Episodic memory ', ' success ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' AD/HD ', ' ADHD ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Cognitive ', ' Endogenous Factors ', ' Scheme ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' improved functioning ', ' psychological outcomes ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' life style intervention ', ' Impairment ', ' cognitive control ', ' public health relevance ', ' mindfulness ', ' cognitive enhancement ', ' longitudinal design ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' mental function ', ' causal model ', ' causal diagram ', ' program dissemination ', ' project dissemination ', ' dynamic system ', ' dynamical system ', ' open data ', ' open science ', ' open-source data ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' connectome ', ' Mindfulness Training ', ' Mindfulness Approach ', ' Mindfulness Therapy ', ' Mindfulness Treatment ', ' Mindfulness-based Approach ', ' Mindfulness-based Therapy ', ' Mindfulness-based Training ', ' Mindfulness-based Treatment ', ' protective factors ', ' individual variation ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variability ', ' Infrastructure ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R37,2021,646865,MO-01
"Predicting Adolescent Depression Using Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY Depression is an impairing and prevalent mood disorder in adolescence, affecting 1 in 6 youth by age 18. So far, the use of conventional statistical approaches has had limited success in delivering tools for accurate individualized prediction of future depression for a specific child. The objective of this project is to build advanced non-linear machine learning algorithms integrating information from multiple sources to deliver accurate, individualized prediction. To accomplish this objective, the research team will use 5,000 variables (biological, cognitive, socio-emotional, environmental) measured on multiple occasions between the prenatal period and age 10 in children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC, N = 15,636). The goal is to use features from the prenatal period to age 10 to estimate risk of reaching clinical levels of depressive symptoms between the ages of 12 and 18 years old. The research team will pursue two specific aims. The first aim is to build an algorithm for accurate prediction of adolescent depression by using informative features from the prenatal period until age 10 with machine learning methods that capture complex, multi-variate associations. The team will use several techniques, including artificial neural networks that exploit temporal information (recurrent neural networks, Long Short-Term Memory networks) to identify constellations of highly predictive features. Based on early-life stress sensitization theory, the first hypothesis is that features from the prenatal and early postnatal periods (up to age 5) provide greater predictive power than features from ages 6-10. The second aim is to determine if features predicting depression are unique to depression or shared with anxiety disorder and substance use disorder. Machine learning algorithms will predict age 18 clinical diagnoses of depression, anxiety disorder, and substance use disorder. The team will test the second hypothesis that some predictive features will be unique for each disorder and some will be shared across all three disorder types (e.g., childhood trauma). By accomplishing these aims, the research team will devise a clinically useful algorithm to estimate a child’s probability of developing adolescent depression. All software that will be created for this project will be open-source, and made freely available online in public repositories. Algorithms that would allow accurate early identification of children at risk to develop depression during future adolescent years would provide new avenues for preemptive interventions. This would yield enormous public health benefits by prioritizing treatment and shifting developmental trajectories away from eventual disorder for millions of individuals worldwide. To realize the potential of this overall impact on the field and society, predictive models that calculate risk with high sensitivity and specificity in childhood are needed. The proposed project aims to use robust, rigorous machine learning algorithms to take on this challenge. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it focuses on depression in adolescence, which is highly prevalent and impairing during this life stage and a major risk factor for suicide. The project is relevant to NIMH’s mission because it aims to identify early behavioral and biological indicators of risk for depression in order to predict the onset of illness and support early

"CBTpro: Scaling up CBT for psychosis using simulated patients and spoken language technologies Psychosis resulting from schizophrenia spectrum disorders and major mood disorders is one of the most disabling health concerns worldwide. Evidence-based psychotherapeutic interventions are recommended as standard of care by national psychosis treatment guidelines but are rarely accessible. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for psychosis (CBTp) is the most well-researched psychotherapy for psychotic disorders, yet fewer than 1% of American mental health providers are trained in this intervention. To date, there has been no scalable way to offer high-quality and sustainable CBTp training to mental health providers. The primary objective of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) proposal is to develop and evaluate a spoken language technology tool – CBTpro -- to support high-quality skills training in CBTp. CBTpro will provide a rapid means of scaling and sustaining CBTp in routine care settings across the US, resulting in more clinicians across the country providing higher quality CBTp to individuals with psychosis. This fast-track STTR proposal has two phases. The objective of Phase I is to develop a CBTpro prototype, which requires three core activities: Aim 1: understand community stakeholder needs to inform software design and functionality; Aim 2: develop CBTpro digital content; and Aim 3: train and validate machine learning algorithms to automatically score CBTp fidelity. The objective of Phase II is to optimize and test the CBTpro tool in real world practice settings. Accordingly, in Phase II, we will Aim 1: conduct a lab usability study (Aim 1a) followed by field testing of the CBTpro prototype (Aim 1b) with 20 trainees; Aim 2: conduct a randomized controlled trial of CBTpro training vs. training as usual (N= 100 providers / N=300 clients), using a nested mixed model analysis to determine the effect of CBTpro on client symptoms, functioning, and recovery; and Aim 3: adopting an NIMH experimental therapeutics approach, assess the hypothesized mechanism by which CBTpro affects clinical outcomes through increased provider fidelity to CBTp (mediation), and test whether the strength of the relationship between these variables is affected by client skill acquisition (moderation). This proposal directly addresses the National Institute of Mental Health’s strategic objectives to improve dissemination, implementation, and continuous improvement of evidence-based mental health services (Objective 4.2) and develop innovative models to dramatically improve the outcomes of mental health services received (Objective 4.3), particularly through the use of novel technology. CBTpro has the potential to reduce the high personal and societal costs associated with serious mental illness, redress the challenges of training amidst high rates of mental health system turnover, support supervisors in quality assurance and improvement efforts, and reduce health disparities associated with mental health workforce shortage areas. Evidence based psychotherapeutic interventions are recommended by national psychosis treatment guidelines, but are inaccessible in routine practice. The objective of this proposal is to systematically develop, pilot, and rigorously test CBTpro, a novel clinician support tool designed to train community mental health workers to provide cognitive behavioral therapy for psychosis skills to their clients.

"The neural bases of placebo effects and their relation to regulatory processes Placebo treatments can induce clinically significant benefits, compared with no-treatment controls, across a variety of disorders. But placebo treatments themselves are pharmacologically and physically inert: Their benefits result from active brain and psychological responses to the treatment context. Neuroscientific studies have established that placebo treatments influence cortical-subcortical brain pathways and neurochemical systems relevant for expectation, appraisals of personal and social meaning, and value-driven learning. These systems are also related to symptom progression across mental health disorders and several other neurological and substance use disorders. Understanding the brain and psychological mechanisms of placebo effects will help improve psychological and neurological (e.g., neuromodulation-based) treatments across disorders. This R01 renewal funds an ongoing program of research that has made fundamental contributions to this literature. It has also identified several significant gaps that are particularly important for connecting placebo research to mental health. One gap is that our understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying placebo effects comes almost purely from studies of pain. The proposed studies extend previous work to study the brain pathways underlying placebo effects in anxiety and social rejection, negative affective processes directly relevant for multiple mental health disorders. Pattern-recognition (machine learning) analyses identify the most symptom-relevant pathways, and test effects of placebo and other context interventions on these pathways. In Aim 1 (Experiments 1-3), we develop models across multiple affective symptoms, parsing affective pathways into those that are symptom-specific and those that generalize across multiple symptoms and outcomes. We also address the role of endogenous opioids, strongly linked to placebo analgesia, in other negative affective experiences. Another gap is that most previous studies of the context variables that drive strong placebo effects—including social influences, treatment history—have not been studied extensively at the brain level. In Aim 2, we study the brain pathways underlying several promising context interventions that enhance the strength of placebo effects, including social modeling of successful or unsuccessful treatment response, initial experiences of treatment success or failure, and the match between placebo suggestions and a person’s predisposition to be receptive to them. Project narrative Though placebo treatments are pharmacologically inert, placebo treatments induce active neurobiological processes related to patients’ expectations, learned associations, perceived care and support, and hope for the future.

"Developing a Data-Driven Management System Using Machine Learning and Mixed-Methods Research to Predict Job Turnover Among MentalHealth Professionals March 11, 2021 Michael C. Freed, Ph.D. Chief, Services Research and Clinical Epidemiology Branch Division of Services and Intervention Research National Institute of Mental Health / NIH Office: 301.443.3747 Email: michael.freed@nih.gov RE: Statement of Candidate Eligibility for a Diversity Supplement to R34 MH119411 (PI: Sadaaki Fukui, Indiana University) Dear Dr. Freed, I am submitting a request for an NIH Diversity Supplement to my parent grant R34. This supplemental request is to support Dr. Eric Kyere who is an assistant professor at Indiana University (IU) School of Social Work. Dr. Kyere is eligible for a diversity supplement as a permanent resident who is originally from Ghana. He is a highly motivated scholar aiming to advance racial equity and justice, making him an ideal candidate for this supplement. Dr. Kyere, who is also a racial minority in the United States, is very passionate about understanding the mechanisms and factors of structural racism and identifying methods to tackle the issue. In order for him to continue his research efforts, he has been preparing for tenure at IU. This diversity supplement is an excellent opportunity to help Dr. Kyere reach his career goals as we describe in the attached proposal. Our supplement research goal (i.e., addressing the racial disparities in the mental health workforce) strongly aligns with the current NIMH strategic plans for strengthening the academic and mental health workforce by recruiting and retaining people from diverse backgrounds. Ensuring the success of diverse academic faculty is critical not only for the minority faculty member but also for us to recruit more diverse students and trainees who eventually will diversify our mental health workforce. Our effort ultimately could improve service access and quality for our minority clients. The supplement will help facilitate Dr. Kyere’s career development as he applies his knowledge and skills to a new project under Aims 2 and 3 of the parent R34 and develops preliminary data that will help him be more competitive for external funding. He will apply for tenure and promotion at IU during the 2022-2023 academic year, and the timing of this award will be ideal. To support his career goals through this diversity supplement, we have created supportive environments to provide quality mentoring. We appreciate your consideration of this proposal. Please let me know if you need additional information. Sincerely, Sadaaki Fukui, PhD., MSW., MA Steven Allen Martin Associate Professor Associate Vice President for Research Administration Indiana University Indiana University School of Social Work Candidate Statement  Eric Kyere, Ph.D. Introduction I am excited to apply for an NIH Diversity Supplement through Dr. Fukui’s R34 grant: Developing a data-driven management system using machine learning and mixed-methods research to predict job turnover among mental health professionals. Under the mentorship of Dr. Fukui, the Diversity Supplement will enable me: (1) develop an in-depth understanding of the experiences of Black employees who provide direct mental health services, and particularly, how they conceptualize their experiences in relation to their decision to stay or leave their organization; (2) increase my statistical knowledge and skills in sub-population data analysis; and (3) strengthen my research portfolio by establishing my expertise in addressing the potential racial disparities in the mental health workforce among persons of African descent. My ultimate goal is to promote a just, fair, and equitable world. The successful completion of work undertaken through Dr. Fukui and his team’s mentorship will improve my ability to secure tenure and sustain my research efforts for addressing structural racism against mental health workers of African descent. Structural racism in the workplace may also affect the health and well-being of their client systems and ultimately society at large. The Diversity Supplement is a great opportunity for me to achieve my research and professional development goals. I am an Assistant Professor at the Indiana University School of Social Work and an Adjunct Professor in the Africana Studies Department at Indiana University. As an immigrant of African descent, originally from Ghana, my research focuses on racism and race (grounded in the racial disparity’s framework), examining the various ways that structural racism may impact the psychosocial, health, and overall well-being of persons of African descent or Blacks, and developing innovative solutions. My professional experiences within mental health organizations, as well as ongoing community engaging research within Black communities, have shown me that the workforce (especially in mental health organizations) has a critical impact on how structural racism affects the psychosocial, health, economic, and overall well- being of Blacks within the organization. Such racial disparities in the mental health workforce in turn may create gaps in mental health organizations’ abilities to serve increasing-diverse client systems. African Americans have been engaged in a series of struggles against cascading racial oppressive forces (including slavery, domestic terrorism, Jim Crow segregation, intentional economic subordination, and racialized mass incarceration) over the course of centuries. Research Gaps As I continue to develop my research agenda with a strong focus on structural racism, I recognize African Americans have made significant strides in several domains of life; however, very visible and vexing racial inequalities (in psychosocial, economics, and health outcomes) persist within the mental health domain and impact performance and retention of Black and other workers of color. Moreover, while structural racism has been suggested as the fundamental driver of racial disparities in the job retention rate and health of Black workers, research has still understudied and undertheorized the impact of structural racism, especially in mental health organizations. Additionally, research, which has examined interpersonal racial discriminations against Blacks in the workplace, is limited when providing rich contextualized experiences that highlight the nuanced realities of racialized experiences of Blacks who work within mental health organizations. From an evolutionary standpoint, structural racism and how it operates are dynamic and respond to the vicissitudes of time. However, there are gaps in the research, since current approaches to measuring and analyzing racism continue to rely on more overt forms of racism. This way of investigating racism limits our ability to accurately measure racism, especially structural racism in the post-Civil Rights era, which in turn constrains our ability to generate relevant knowledge to inform solution-based decisions that address racism within organizations. This Diversity Supplemental grant, under the supervision of Dr. Fukui and his team, will provide me with the opportunity to apply qualitative methodologies to an in-depth investigation of the impact of structural racism with which Black employees (who provide mental health services in mental health organizations) have to contend. We anticipate that the findings will inform policy and practice intervention to enhance organizational culture and conditions for Black and other employees of color to improved job retention and work performance. Under Dr. Fukui’s mentorship, I will work with the research team on the R34 grant, which includes graduate research assistants, to develop qualitative interview protocols and conduct interviews and analysis to identify ways racism operates through organizational processes to affect Black employees’ decisions about their job retention and turnover. I also will analyze the administrative and survey data that have been or will be collected in the parent R34 in order to understand the potential racial disparities that disproportionately affect Black employees. We have planned several sub-population analyses to address our research hypotheses. Research Interests to Address the Gaps As a junior researcher on a tenure track position at the Indiana University School of Social Work, it is important for me to strengthen my research focus on structural racism and its impact on Blacks. It is also important to secure external grants to generate research knowledge that offers innovative solutions to structural racism toward persons of color and in society at large. As part of achieving this goal, I will use the data that will be gathered from the qualitative and quantitative inquiries from Dr. Fukui’s R34 in order to apply for an NIMH grant to work with Dr. Fukui and the research team. Our planned proposal will address structural racism that may impede inclusive and diverse work environments and undermine people of color’s productivity and job retention within mental health organizations. I just completed training on Group Concept Mapping (GCM): a community-based participatory research that uses social dialogue to engage with research participants to generate insights on community concerns and potential solutions (e.g., anti-racist framework), identify implementation strategies, and develop evaluation plans that represent the voices of the stakeholders affected by the problem (in our study, Black employees within mental health organizations). I am planning to use GCM as a core methodology for our planning grant. Securing external grants will enhance my prospect for tenure at my school and position me to advance research on racism and race to serve the Black community and promote racial justice. Our planning studies could contribute to building a diverse and resilient workforce and ultimately the vitality of a racially diverse society, which is strongly aligned with the NIMH strategic plans. My Educational and Training Background My PhD education has provided me with strong methodological and analytical frameworks (e.g., quantitative, qualitative methods, critical institutional analysis) from transdisciplinary perspectives to engage with organizations and individuals in order to understand the nuanced ways by which structural racisms (through institutional or organizational cultures) may affect persons of African descent. They include the various coping and resistance strategies Blacks initiate to resist or cope with their racialized experiences. My research approaches have been focused to identify and interrupt the mechanisms by which racism revives itself through institutions/organizations and fostering a working culture that is responsive to persons of African descent in order for them to thrive, thereby increasing their effectiveness and productivity. However, since my doctoral graduation and joining the faculty at the Indiana University School of Social Work, my work has mostly focused on quantitative secondary data analyses using publicly available data and conceptual methodologies. Further, I have not had the opportunity to collect original data or conduct research within externally-funded projects. Acquiring the procedures and conducts of externally funded research is critical for me to grow as a researcher and to become a future research mentor in this field. Importance of Mentorship I am, therefore, highly motivated and excited to submit this Diversity Supplement grant. The proposed training fellowship, under the mentorship of Dr. Fukui and his team, will provide me with the opportunity to work with the research team on the parent R34 grant to apply my knowledge and skills to understand the experiences of Black employees regarding turnover and retention and to use the data in order to inform the creation of an inclusive work culture that is grounded in the racial disparity framework (e.g., understanding the vast differences, which are unrelated to individual and biological traits, that exist in the experiences, psychosocial, health, and performance of persons of color compared to Whites). Race conscious (rather than colorblind) policies and practices are critical to identify, validate, and address these differences. Dr. Fukui is one of the senior colleagues who is committed to the development and retention of junior faculty at the Indiana University School of Social Work. He has provided me with critical feedback on research, manuscripts, and grant writings. I have worked with him on several manuscripts and grant applications. One of our manuscripts that investigated the impact of racial discrimination on African American youth’s depressive symptoms was recently published. While my work has not been directly on Black employees’ turnover within mental health organizations, my related experiences working in the mental health field as well as my ongoing research and engagement with persons of African descent situate me to make significant contributions to addressing racism within mental health organizations, including the significant issue of turnover among employees of color. Most importantly, the Diversity Supplement grant will provide me with secured training time and solid research experiences with Dr. Fukui, given his long-standing research and experience with mental health organizations, his willingness to mentor me, and my passion and motivation to contribute to addressing structural racism. I am excited about this opportunity and look forward to a favorable decision on this application for my professional development and growth. Summary The Diversity Supplement will secure the quality mentoring time and experiences with Dr. Fukui and his team that will be critical for me to develop my expertise in addressing racial disparities in the mental health workforce.

"Full Scale Randomized Trial of an Innovative Conversational Agent for Smoking Cessation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (DESCRIPTION) Cigarette smoking accounts for 480,000 premature deaths and one third of all cancer deaths annually in the US. There is enormous need for high-impact, cost-effective population-level interventions for smoking cessation. For the past 15 years, mobile phone-delivered text messaging interventions such as the NCI’s SmokefreeTXT have been a prominent technology addressing this need. However, very much like all widely available technologies for smoking cessation (e.g., websites), text messaging interventions have modest quit rates, driven largely by low engagement. Fortunately, a new technology provides a therapeutic conversation to address the problem of engagement that impacts text messaging and other current digital technologies for smoking cessation. Advances in machine learning, natural language processing, and cloud computing are now making it possible to create and widely disseminate conversational agents (CAs), which are computer-powered digital coaches designed to form long-term social-emotional connections with users through conversations. CAs are supportive, empathic, reflectively listen, provide personalized responses, and offer goal setting and advice appropriately timed to the needs of the user. Regarding CAs for smoking cessation, the major knowledge gaps are: (1) their efficacy, (2) theoretical mechanisms, and (3) the cost-effectiveness. Also unexplored are the potential baseline moderators of CAs for smoking cessation. We recently developed a CA for smoking cessation, called “QuitBot,” evaluated it in a diary study, and then tested it in a pilot randomized controlled trial (N = 306), comparing it with the NCI’s SmokefreeTXT. The pilot RCT design was very feasible with 93% three-month follow-up. QuitBot had: (a) high participant engagement and (b) high quit rates at the three-month follow-up—very promising in comparison with SmokefreeTXT. Addressing these knowledge gaps and building on the promising results of our QuitBot research, the project will conduct a randomized controlled trial of QuitBot (n = 760) versus SmokefreeTXT (n = 760) with 12-month follow-up in order to determine whether QuitBot: (1) provides higher quit rates than SmokefreeTXT, (2) has smoking cessation outcomes significantly mediated by therapeutic alliance processes and engagement, and (3) is cost-effective vs. SmokefreeTXT. In addition, this study will explore whether these baseline factors moderate the effectiveness of QuitBot: trust, social support, and demographics (e.g., sex). This innovative project will advance the fields of research on CAs both for smoking cessation in particular and for health behavior change in general— regardless of whether the results are positive or null. Positive results could have high population-level impact and stimulate new lines of research into CA dissemination and implementation, and the adaptation of CAs for multiple subpopulations of smokers, languages, and community and medical settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The overall aim of this project is to determine the effectiveness of a conversational agent for smoking cessation. If successful, this intervention can be cost-effectively scaled on a population level, thereby making a high public health impact.",Full Scale Randomized Trial of an Innovative Conversational Agent for Smoking Cessation,10120658,R01CA247156,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Cost Measures ', ' Cost metrics ', ' cost measurement ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Empathy ', ' Goals ', ' Judgment ', ' Language ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Smoking ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Quality-Adjusted Life Years ', ' QALY ', ' Quality-Adjusted Life Expectancy ', ' smoking cessation ', ' cease smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' stop smoking ', ' Mediating ', ' improved ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Medical ', ' Trust ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' cigarette use ', ' Policies ', ' Sample Size ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Smoker ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' diaries ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' behavior change ', ' American ', ' success ', ' Participant ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' smoking cessation treatment ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Antismoking ', ' anti-smoking ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Health behavior change ', ' Abstinence ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' demographics ', ' public health relevance ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' arm ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' cloud computer ', ' smartphone Application ', ' Android App ', ' Android Application ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smartphone App ', ' iOS app ', ' iOS application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iPhone Application ', ' Text Messaging ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' patient engagement ', ' participant engagement ', ' randomized effectiveness trial ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' Dissemination and Implementation ', ' text messaging intervention ', ' text based intervention ', ' text intervention ', ' ']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2021,730398,WA-07
"UZIMA-DS: UtiliZing health Information for Meaningful impact in  East Africa through Data Science PROJECT SUMMARY – Overall Component Africa is the youngest continent in the world, with 60% of its population under the age of 25. The span between early life to young adulthood represents a critical window where biological, environment and psychosocial events can significantly impact long- term uzima, which means health/well-being in Swahili. Coupled with the recent technological advances and the enormous volumes of data collected in Africa, there is an unprecedented opportunity to leverage data science to identify and improve the health trajectories of young Africans. However, significant analytical and computational barriers persist that impede our ability to use this information to change care at the community and individual level. Our proposed Research Hub, UZIMA-DS, aims to change this narrative by UtiliZing health Information for Meaningful impact in East Africa through Data Science. We will create a scalable and sustainable platform to apply novel approaches to data assimilation and advanced artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML)-based methods to serve as early warning systems to address critical health issues impacting young Africans in two domains: maternal, newborn and child health and mental health. Our Hub addresses three critical needs across the translational spectrum of data science: 1) Harmonization of multimodal data sources for meaningful use and analyses; 2) Leveraging temporal patterns of data to identify trajectories through prediction modeling using AI/ML-based methods; and 3) Engaging with key stakeholders to identify pathways for dissemination and sustainability of these models into target communities. For our Maternal and Child Health Study (Project 1), we will leverage the large and diverse existing data sets in Kenya, including two demographic surveillance systems, cohort studies and hospital data, to develop and validate AI/ML-based prediction models to identify women of childbearing age at high risk for poor pregnancy outcomes (e.g., pregnancy-induced hypertension, low birthweight) and non-communicable diseases later in life and children at risk of future poor life outcomes (e.g., developmental delays). For our Mental Health Study (Project 2), leverage existing surveillance data as well as novel mobile technologies (e.g., mobile apps, wearables) for the development of existing and new AI/ML-based prediction models to identify adolescents and young healthcare workers at risk of depression and suicide ideation in Kenya. Our Hub and Projects will be supported by an Admin Core, Data Management and Analysis Core, and a Dissemination and Sustainability Core, which will facilitate engagement with multisectoral stakeholders to identify sustainable model dissemination pathways into target communities. Ultimately, our work will empower African researchers to carry forward the UZIMA-DS Hub to address on-going and evolving health needs of Africans by building sustainable infrastructure, expertise, and partnerships for long-lasting impact. The UZIMA-DS Hub can serve as a model that can be scaled to other countries and health domains with the greater DS-I consortium to transform care delivery in Africa, ensuring that current and future generations of Africans can achieve uzima. PROJECT NARRATIVE – Overall Component Our proposed Research Hub, UZIMA-DS (UtiliZe health Information for Meaningful impact in East Africa through Data Science) will create a scalable and sustainable platform to apply novel approaches to data assimilation and advanced artificial intelligence/machine learning-based methods to serve as early warning systems to 1) improve health outcomes for at-risk mothers and children and 2) improve mental health outcomes for at-risk adolescents and young adults in Kenya. We will bring together method experts in statistics, computer science, and informatics, health domain experts and practitioners, and partnerships with key stakeholders to not only improve the quality, efficiency, and relevance of multidisciplinary data science in health research, but also its transparency, reproducibility, and dissemination for sustainable impact in Africa. Thus, helping ensure current and future generations of Africans can achieve uzima (health/well-being in Swahili).",UZIMA-DS: UtiliZing health Information for Meaningful impact in  East Africa through

"Computational ontology of brain systems across the human neuroimaging literature Project Summary/Abstract Symptom-based diagnoses of mental illness are highly comorbid, biologically heterogeneous, and poorly predictive of treatment response. The National Institute of Mental Health has led efforts to redefine mental illness by its biological causes, establishing the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework as a guide for investigating variation in basic brain systems. RDoC has been influential, named in hundreds of grants and publications, but it has yet to be systematically validated. It is unknown whether circuit-function links underlying the RDoC brain systems are reproducible across studies, and organizing principles remain largely untested. While the structure of RDoC as a modular hierarchy has evidence in resting state analyses, it has not been shown whether this applies to systems that support the diverse mental states affected in psychiatric disease. It is necessary to validate RDoC, and moreover, to establish fundamental principles of organization for systems defined jointly by human brain structure and function. The objective of this proposal is to apply large- scale computational neuroimaging meta-analyses to build a data-driven ontology that will not only serve as a benchmark in evaluating the validity of RDoC but also characterize the architecture of systems for human brain function. The long-term goal is to redefine mental illness by differences from healthy function within the brain systems of a data-driven ontology, facilitating rational targeting of neuromodulation treatments. The proposed meta-analyses will be the most comprehensive in the field with 18,155 MRI and PET studies already collected. The mental functions considered in these studies have been extracted from article texts using natural language processing, and brain circuits will be mapped from the brain coordinate data that were reported. The hypothesis is that brain systems are comprised of reproducible circuit-function links organized into a modular hierarchy, which for some systems will require updates to RDoC. This will be tested by comparing RDoC systems against those of a data-driven ontology. Aim 1: The reproducibility of circuit-function links will be evaluated by the performance of neural network classifiers predicting functions in article texts from circuits in brain scan data, and vice versa. Aim 2: The modularity of brain systems will be evaluated by a graph theoretic approach, and hierarchical structure will be assessed by representational similarity analysis. The impact of this project will be to validate the foremost psychiatry research framework and to characterize human brain systems through an innovative computational strategy. Together with targeted academic training in neurobiology, the fellowship is designed to offer preparation for a career as a physician-scientist leading advances in computational psychiatry. Training will be supported by an environment that combines world-class computing resources with esteemed and engaged mentors in psychiatry, neuroscience, and computer science. Project Narrative First-line treatments routinely fail for most of the 45 million US adults living with mental illness because psychiatric diagnoses lack a biological basis, making them unreliable predictors of treatment response. The proposed project will lay the foundation for a biologically based diagnostic system in psychiatry by characterizing the composition and structure of human brain systems through innovative computational meta-analyses of nearly 20,000 neuroimaging articles. When it is understood what makes up a brain system and how systems are organized, mental illness can be redefined by variation from healthy function, facilitating successful targeting of brain-based treatments.",Computational ontology of brain systems across the human neuroimaging literature,10194380,F30MH120956,"['Academic Training ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Biology ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Fellowship ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Influentials ', ' Literature ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Mentors ', ' Names ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Physicians ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' PET ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET imaging ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PETT ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' mental state ', ' mental status ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Psychiatric Diagnosis ', ' Scientist ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Brain scan ', ' Performance ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' computer science ', ' Expert Opinion ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Graph ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Social Support System ', ' Support System ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Brain region ', ' Symptoms ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Higher Order Chromatin Folding ', ' Higher Order Structure ', ' Higher Order Chromatin Structure ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict treatment response ', ' therapy prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cognitive ', ' Ontology ', ' Scheme ', ' Update ', ' Preparation ', ' Text ', ' neuroinformatics ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' system architecture ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' mental function ', ' brain circuitry ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network classifier ', ' diagnostic platform ', ' diagnostic system ', ' ']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F30,2021,38222,CA-18
"Mechanisms of resilience to developmental stress in children and adolescents. PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Children and adolescents often grow up in the face of substantial developmental stress (i.e. trauma). While for some, this shifts the developmental trajectory to that of mental and general health disorders, others are resilient. Most research on developmental psychopathology is focused on risk while little is known on the mechanisms that confer resilience. The current study aims to identify biological (genomic, immune), psychological and cognitive mechanisms that underpin resilience in youth as defined by having low mood- anxiety and suicidal outcomes in youth with substantial developmental stress exposure (i.e. trauma and family history of depression). Elucidating resilience mechanisms has huge clinical implications as it will improve stratification of risk to develop depression and/or suicidal behavior, and could identify biological, psychological and cognitive targets that can inform development of future preventive interventions aimed at promoting resilience, reducing the mental and general health adverse outcomes associated with childhood adversity. The study capitalizes on a large dataset of genotyped youths from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC), that have been comprehensively phenotyped for cognitive performance and psychopathology, and that reported substantial trauma exposure. The proposed research integrates genomic and cognitive data with clinical measures used to define resilience in cross sectional analysis of ~9500 PNC youths (Aim 1); incorporates longitudinal data of depression and suicide measures, pulled from electronic medical record in a subset of ~750 PNC youths (Aim 2); and relies on prospective data collection that includes immune profiling of selected PNC individuals to allow identification of immune signature of resilience (Aim 3). Integration of genomic with clinical, cognitive and immune data will allow predictive modeling, and Big Data driven analysis will allow identification of resilience mechanisms. The candidate is a Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist physician scientist who is committed to translational research in youth at risk for psychiatric conditions. His overarching career goal is to develop methods for early identification of subclinical phenotypes before the onset of major psychiatric disorders (i.e. depression and suicide attempts) and, through neuroscience informed interventions, divert the developmental trajectory from that of risk to that of resilience. The career development plan capitalizes on a multidisciplinary mentorship team. It involves one-on one mentoring with the primary “clinical research” mentor as well as the genomic, biostatistical, neurocognitive and immune system expert co- mentors, integrated with hands on research supervision in data collection and statistical analysis, and didactic coursework and workshops. The program is tailored to meet research and training aims. The project will be conducted in the fostering environment of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania, that will provide the academic mentorship and the required resources to execute the research and training aims, allowing the candidate to launch an independent research career. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood adversities impose risk to general and mental health development, including youth depression and suicidal behavior, still most children are resilient. Through integration of genetic, clinical, cognitive and demographic data from research data and medical records, this study will identify mechanisms that underpin resilience in a generalizable large sample of community youth with substantial exposure to adversity. Understanding resilience mechanisms is a critical milestone on the mission to develop neuroscience informed preventive interventions aimed at promoting resilience and reducing the health burden of

"Linking brain activity during naturalistic tasks to individual phenotypes on the depression spectrum PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Rather than a dichotomy between health and pathology, many mental illnesses—especially depression and other mood disorders—are best conceptualized as the far end of a phenotypic spectrum, suggesting that characterizing individual differences in brain function and behavior will help further our understanding of disease. Existing work suggests that fMRI has the potential to predict individual behaviors from brain function, yet progress has been hindered by an overreliance on group studies (i.e., patients versus controls) and limited paradigms (i.e., either highly controlled tasks that risk being artificial, or at the other extreme, resting state, which is entirely unconstrained and difficult to interpret). Naturalistic fMRI, in which subjects do complex, engaging tasks such as watching films or listening to stories, offers an alternative that more closely mimics real-world cognition and may allow researchers to extract richer, more meaningful information from a single individual’s scan. As such, these paradigms are promising candidates for brain “stress tests” that would elicit patterns of brain activity that predict present or future behaviors. The specific aims of this project are: (1) to leverage existing large-scale datasets to develop methods to predict phenotypes from naturalistic fMRI data; (2) to design and conduct an fMRI study using targeted film stimuli to draw out individual variability of interest, specifically in traits related to depression; and (3) to extend the newly developed paradigms and analyses to a longitudinal study of a population at risk for depression and/or other mood disorders. Several innovative approaches to data analysis will be investigated. The central hypothesis is that brain activity evoked by these paradigms will vary across individuals in a continuous, multidimensional space that covaries with phenotype strength, that these relationships will be strong enough to predict phenotypes in unseen individuals, and that modified (e.g., attenuated) versions of patterns associated with illness will be detectable via these paradigms in those at risk before the emergence of symptoms. The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent NIH-funded faculty member at a research-intensive university, with a research program exploring the basic cognitive neuroscience of individual differences in personality and cognition, as well as developing translational applications for psychiatry. To reach this goal, the training objectives for this award are to enhance the PI’s skills in the following areas: (1) applying machine learning techniques to predict individual-subject behavior from fMRI data; (2) conducting neuroimaging and behavioral research on depression and mood disorders with clinical and at-risk populations; and (3) gaining professional skills essential for a successful independent research career. The environment in which the career development will take place is the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Mental Health, a vibrant community with outstanding resources to support the proposed project, including relevant courses and seminars, state-of-the-art facilities for MRI data acquisition and analysis, computing power, and expertise and guidance from senior scientists in neuroscience, engineering, machine learning and psychiatry. PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Mental illness—especially depression and other mood disorders—is a massive burden on individuals, families and societies, yet psychiatrists lack brain-based biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. This project seeks to fill that gap by conceptualizing mood disorders as the extreme end of a continuous phenotypic spectrum in the human population, and using functional brain imaging to study how individuals differ in their neural and behavioral responses to naturalistic, emotionally evocative stimuli. This project will deepen our understanding of the neurobiology of individual variability related to mood disorders, and has the potential to lead to a “stress test” for psychiatry that would help identify at-risk individuals for earlier intervention.",Linking brain activity during naturalistic tasks to individual phenotypes on the depression spectrum,10238174,R00MH120257,"['Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cognition ', ' Combined Modality Therapy ', ' Multimodal Therapy ', ' Multimodal Treatment ', ' combination therapy ', ' combined modality treatment ', ' combined treatment ', ' multi-modal therapy ', ' multi-modal treatment ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emotions ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Mental Processes ', ' Methods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Personality ', ' Phenotype ', ' Psychiatrist ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Societies ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Film ', ' Glean ', ' Clip ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' Attenuated ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' interest ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' trait ', ' skills ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' movie ', ' Categories ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Normalities ', ' Normalcy ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Intramural Program ', ' Intramural Research Program ', ' Senior Scientist ', ' Behavioral ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Population ', ' Stress Tests ', ' Individual Differences ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' emotional stimulus ', ' data acquisition ', ' brain behavior ', ' healthy volunteer ', ' public health relevance ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' anxious ', ' behavioral response ', ' behavior response ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' diagnostic biomarker ', ' diagnostic marker ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' mood symptom ', ' individual variation ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variability ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' Hyperactivity ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R00,2021,249000,NH-02
"Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for the assessment of severity of depressive symptoms Depression is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, affecting an estimated 300 million people. Evidence-based treatments are available and measurement-based care has been described as the gold standard. Monitoring of depressive symptoms is currently performed with self-administered and interview- based assessment methods conducted by clinicians in their offices. However, the shortage of mental health specialists and the limited resources available to primary care physicians who often manage patients with depression, prevent close monitoring of symptoms delaying optimal treatment potentially prolonging suffering. Passive recording of behavioral data (gathering information without individual's direct input) has been identified as a potentially feasible method for long-term monitoring of depression. To date, most studies have collected passive behavioral data in ""real time"" through mobile apps (i.e. accelerometer, phone clicks) with the goal of identifying potential markers of depression. However, this method lacks critical biological indicators of depression, including sleep, arousal, and motion. Recent development in wristband sensor technology developed by out lab has allowed to measure physiological parameters like gait, heart rate variability (HRV) and electrodermal activity (EDA) continuously in “real time”, allowing a broader anatomical and neurophysiological understanding of emotion, behavior, and cognition in mood disorders as they occur during routine activity. During the past decade, along with the development of sensors, we have seen the progressive use of machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence that enables the detection of complex patterns in multimodal data, allowing the development of complex models. The combination of sensor technology and machine learning allows detailed measurement in real time of a wealth of behaviors predicting mood variation. Over the past 2 years, our interdisciplinary team, including one of the leading lab on depression research, and one of the most innovative lab on affective computing, has conducted a study applying machine learning analytics to create a model combining wristband sensors data and phone- based passive measurements to assess severity of depressive symptoms. In our pilot study with depressed patients monitored over 8 weeks, we found that an algorithm based on biological and behavioral sensor data could estimate depression severity evaluated by a clinician with high accuracy. The proposed study will further refine our model in a sample of 100 adults with depression, assessed over 12 weeks. We anticipate that the proposed study will enable the development of an objective, passive, sensor-based algorithm able to measure depressive symptom severity. The identification of reliable, objective, passive assessment of depressive symptoms with biosensors will have significant ramifications for the monitoring of depression, early detection of response, remission and relapse and ultimately contribute to the advancement of precision medicine. Narrative  The proposed project will create a novel method to assess depressive symptoms by harnessing modern machine learning analytics, phone sensors, and wrist-band sensors. Measurement-based treatment is considered optimal and the development of a valid passive, objective, behavioral and biological assessment of depressive symptoms that does not rely on clinician interviews will improve monitoring and ultimately improve treatment significantly. Ultimately, the ability to leverage a remarkable wealth of behavioral and biological data has the potential to transform the delivery of treatment for depression.",Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for the assessment of severity of depressive symptoms,10063043,R01MH118274,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Arousal ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Cognition ', ' Communication ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Emotions ', ' Gait ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Interview ', ' Melancholias ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Moods ', ' Motion ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Self Administration ', ' Self-Administered ', ' Sleep ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Temperature ', ' Time ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physical activity ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Remission ', ' Disease remission ', ' information gathering ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' biological sensor ', ' Biosensor ', ' novel ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' portability ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict treatment response ', ' therapy prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' heart rate variability ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile device application ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' anxious ', ' depressed patient ', ' Accelerometer ', ' accelerometry ', ' activity monitor ', ' activity tracker ', ' sensor technology ', ' sensing technology ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' optimal treatments ', ' optimal therapies ', ' affective computing ', ' multimodal data ', ' multi-modal data ', ' multi-modal datasets ', ' multimodal datasets ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,498501,MA-08
"Closing the loop: development of real-time, personalized brain stimulation Project Summary  We are in critical need of targeted and individualized treatments for mental health disorders, which affect nearly 50% of Americans during our lifetimes. Brain stimulation treatments, including repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), represent the front-line of innovative approaches to correct dysfunctional brain networks for patients suffering from mental illness. rTMS is FDA-approved for depression and obsessive- compulsive disorder (OCD) with clinical trials underway for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use, among others. However, as currently administered, rTMS lacks a biomarker to individually optimize treatment and thus suffers from a poor clinical response rate (<50%). Without personalization of rTMS, we risk a one-size-fits-all treatment for all psychiatric disorders, not dissimilar to how antidepressants are administered.  Using simultaneous TMS and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG), I identified a depression severity biomarker from a double-blind randomized clinical trial treating depressed patients with one month of active or placebo rTMS. The degree of this biomarker change significantly predicted clinical improvement after rTMS treatment. Direct brain recordings further suggest that a single stimulation session is sufficient to modulate this biomarker, indicating that this brain-based biomarker can be monitored daily to support empiric treatment optimization.  With this in mind, I propose to develop the first broadly generalizable platform for real-time biomarker monitoring (Aim #1) and personalized rTMS treatment (Aims #2 & 3). I will enroll 54 depressed patients to participate in a cross-over, placebo-controlled study directly comparing personalized, adaptive rTMS to standard rTMS. Primary outcome will be target engagement and dose-response of the depression severity biomarker. Successful implementation of this work includes the early stratification of treatment responders and personalized and more effective treatments for non-responders. This approach is broadly applicable to other depression biomarkers, all psychiatric populations treated with rTMS, and other brain stimulation modalities. More generally, my goals are to establish the fundamental principles of human brain plasticity and to construct platforms for rapid biomarker development, engagement, and integration into personalized brain stimulation treatments. Project Narrative We need targeted, individualized treatments for mental health disorders, which affects nearly 50% of Americans. Brain stimulation treatments target dysfunctional brain networks with minimal side effects but are currently applied in a one-size-fits-all manner, thus limiting its efficacy. I aim to develop a non-invasive personalized brain stimulation platform for neuropsychiatric disorders; here I will create a real-time monitoring system for brain changes, evaluate the mechanism underlying these brain changes, and develop and test an adaptive stimulation paradigm to maximally drive individual brain changes and improve clinical outcome.","Closing the loop: development of

"Using Machine Learning to Develop Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions for Smoking Cessation PROJECT SUMMARY Mobile technology has enormous potential for delivering highly innovative, dynamic smoking cessation interventions. Phone sensors, wearable technology, and real time data collection methods such as ecological momentary assessment (EMA) have made it possible to collect a wealth of environmental and physiological data such as location, heart rate, and mood. Environmental and situational cues such as craving and proximity to others smoking are highly predictive of lapse among those trying to quit, suggesting that lapse risk is characterized by immediate, dynamic influences. Emerging strategies such as just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAI), aim to prevent smoking lapse using tailored support delivered via mobile technology in the moments when it is most needed. Although research has identified antecedents of smoking lapse based on observations from EMA data, studies have been unable to utilize the full spectrum of contextual and environmental data available with current technology. Given the importance of dynamic influences on lapse risk, there is a critical need for strategies that accurately identify moments of highest lapse risk to improve cessation interventions. Recent research has demonstrated the utility of machine learning to predict individual behavior. Machine learning is a robust data analytic strategy that can produce highly accurate predictive models from large datasets and can automatically adapt to new data in real time. The overall objective of this application is to use supervised machine learning methods to develop an automated algorithm to quantify smoking lapse risk at the individual level. Specifically, we aim: 1) to apply supervised machine learning methods to quantify personalized risk of smoking lapse, and 2) to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of delivering a personalized, just-in-time adaptive intervention driven by machine learning prediction of smoking lapse risk in real time. The proposed research and training plan will take place at The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC) and the Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC). Training will focus on increasing knowledge of machine learning methodology, and the conduct and analysis of JITAIs, which will facilitate completion of the proposed project. Results of the proposed research have the potential to reduce the amount and frequency of data needed from participants and sensors, enabling the development of less burdensome interventions. It is expected that completion of these aims will yield preliminary data to inform an automated, dynamic intervention that fully utilizes the strengths of mobile technology for measuring individual behavior and environmental context in real time. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will be among the first to use machine learning methods to predict risk of individual smoking lapse in real time. The resulting algorithm will provide a personalized model for each participant that adapts to new data and triggers the delivery of a tailored, precision intervention when it is most needed. If successful, this project and its methodology could be adapted to target other health behaviors such as diet, physical activity, or other substance use disorders.",Using Machine Learning to Develop Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions for Smoking Cessation,10294298,R00DA046564,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Control Groups ', ' Cues ', ' Data Collection ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Moods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Oklahoma ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Smoking ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Frequencies ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' craving ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' smoking cessation treatment ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile device application ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile technology ', ' Data Analytics ', ' Accelerometer ', ' accelerometry ', ' activity monitor ', ' activity tracker ', ' secondary analysis ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' adaptive intervention ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' automated algorithm ', ' automatic algorithm ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R00,2021,248999,TX-09
"Racial disparities in biomarkers, tobacco cessation, and smoking relapse in association with electronic cigarette use Project Summary Although enormous progress has been made in reducing cigarette smoking in the United States, large disparities remain across subpopulations such as racial minorities. Quitting smoking can greatly reduce the risk of disease and early death. However, African Americans (AA) are less likely to quit smoking successfully than are non-Hispanic Whites, and they are also three times more likely to smoke menthol cigarettes than Whites. There is a remarkable variation in the incidence of lung cancer due to cigarette smoking among racial/ethnic groups in the United States, and African Americans have significantly greater risks than Whites at lower levels of smoking. Tobacco use landscape is changing among U.S. adults with an estimated 4.5% of adults aged 18 years and older reporting current use of electronic cigarettes (EC). Evidence suggests that e-cigarette aerosol is substantially less toxic than combustible cigarette smoking, but e-cigarette use may also post elevated risk for former smokers to relapse back to combustible cigarette smoking. Biomarker can play an important role in assessing the potential health effects of tobacco products and studies have found that AA have higher levels of serum cotinine per cigarette smoked, higher urinary amount of TNE and NNAL than Whites. However, evidence on the racial disparities of biomarker outcomes of EC use is scarce, especially whether and to what extent they are different from use of various EC devices, flavors, and transitions in EC ↔ cigarettes. The overarching goal of this study is to examine the racial disparities in biomarkers of exposure and toxicants in association with EC use by analyzing the restricted Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Wave 1-4 biomarker data. We will link the biomarker data with the PATH adult surveys to identify the between- person and within-person differences in biomarkers by use of different vaping products, flavors, and transition in EC and combustible cigarettes across different waves (Aim 1). We will further leverage machine learning algorithms to develop a composite bio (biomarker)-socio (socio-demographics) -psycho (psychosocial factors) risk index score for each racial/ethnic group to predict subsequent abstinence from cigarette smoking and relapse to cigarette smoking since these 2 outcomes represent the most meaningful transitions from a public health perspective. This study is innovative in its focus on racial disparities of biomarkers by leveraging the nationally longitudinal data, and on using machine learning algorithms to predict future smoking cessation and relapse behaviors in EC ↔ cigarette transition. Fulfillment of these aims will build a scientific base for maximizing the value of existing biospecimen collections. Findings from this R21 study are expected to inform regulatory strategies to reduce tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and set the stage for a future R01 application that will develop personalized intervention strategies that incorporate biomarker measures to reduce racial disparities in tobacco use and improve health outcomes. 1 Project Narrative The proposed study seeks to examine racial disparities in biomarkers of e-cigarette use by linking the PATH Waves 1-4 restricted biomarker data and adult survey data. The study will extend our knowledge on the heterogeneity in biomarkers of exposure and toxicants across racial and ethnic groups, including use of different vaping products, flavors, and transition between e-cigarettes and cigarettes. We will further develop a bio-socio-psycho risk index score to predict abstinence from cigarette smoking, relapse to cigarette use, and tobacco-related health outcomes using machine learning algorithms across racial and ethnic groups.","Racial disparities in biomarkers, tobacco cessation, and smoking relapse in association with electronic cigarette use",10232728,R21DA054818,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavior ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Communities ', ' Cotinine ', ' Scotine ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Ethnic People ', ' Ethnic Population ', ' Ethnicity People ', ' Ethnicity Population ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Menthol ', ' Metals ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Nicotine ', ' Play ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Respiratory Signs and Symptoms ', ' airway symptom ', ' pulmonary symptom ', ' respiratory symptom ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Measures ', ' smoking cessation ', ' cease smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' stop smoking ', ' African American ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' Hispanics ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' cigarette use ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' lung cancer ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Smoker ', ' Cigarette Smoker ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' psychosocial ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' tobacco product use ', ' Tobacco use ', ' toxicant ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' Cigarette ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Data ', ' Population Analysis ', ' Collection ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' urinary ', ' reduce tobacco use ', ' reduction in tobacco use ', ' tobacco use reduction ', ' tobacco exposure ', ' exposure to tobacco ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' 18 year old ', ' 18 years of age ', ' age 18 years ', ' eighteen year old ', ' eighteen years of age ', ' Abstinence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' ethnoracial ', ' high risk ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' smoking relapse ', ' Electronic cigarette ', ' e-cig ', ' e-cigarette ', ' ecig ', ' ecigarette ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' vaping ', ' racial disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' racial minority ', ' Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health ', ' electronic cigarette user ', ' e-cig user ', ' e-cigarette user ', ' ecig user ', ' ecigarette user ', ' cigarette user ', ' combustible cigarette ', ' conventional cigarette ', ' traditional cigarette ', ' electronic cigarette use ', ' e-cig use ', ' e-cigarette use ', ' ecig use ', ' ecigarette use ', ' cigarette smoke ', ' tobacco toxicant ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' tobacco products ', ' e-cigarette aerosols ', ' e-cig aerosols ', ' e-cig vapor ', ' e-cigarette vapor ', ' ecig aerosols ', ' ecig vapor ', ' ecigarette aerosols ', ' ecigarette vapor ', ' electronic cigarette aerosol ', ' electronic cigarette vapor ', ' 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol ', ' NNAL ', ' former smoker ', ' ex-smoker ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2021,204739,NE-02
"Next generation drugs for bipolar depression and maintenance Blue Oak Pharmaceuticals is developing the next generation of drugs for the treatment of acute bipolar depression and long-term maintenance (BPD), a mental disorder that affects ~6 million adult Americans. Existing drug classes are relatively ineffective and very few new modes-of-action have been developed in the past 40+ years. This is due, in part, to the biopharma industry’s focus on drugging single molecular targets, and the lack of predictive animal models for bipolar disorder. To overcome these significant hurdles, Blue Oak’s drug discovery paradigm combines custom-designed privileged chemotypes with a proven deep behavioral profiling method. Successful Phase I studies using this novel, but previously validated, approach resulted in the discovery and optimization of a novel lead compound for the treatment of BPD. The therapeutic utility of drug candidates was confirmed using molecular target profiling, ex vivo imaging of the forebrain circuits implicated in BPD and predictive translational medicine biomarkers. Phase II studies are focused on advancing the lead compound through Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies, the necessary next step for FDA review and approval of human studies. Aims include: (1) quantification of the preclinical therapeutic (safety) margin for the lead, or superior back-up molecule, including analyses of antidepressant activity; (2) confirmation of an enhanced EEG gamma band as a reliable translational biomarker of BPD drug activity and efficacy in non-human primates; (3) manufacture and qualification of cGLP drug product suitable for IND-enabling studies; and (4) completion of preclinical studies necessary for an IND filing with the FDA, including standard absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADME/TOX) preclinical studies and preclinical dose escalation studies necessary prior to first-in-human clinical studies. The successful completion of these aims will result in a Type B meeting to obtain guidance from the FDA and the filing of an IND package. The Blue Oak Pharmaceuticals team includes experienced “drug hunters” with expertise in systems neurobiology, medicinal chemistry and informatics, and advisors with proven track records in drug development and commercialization. The internal team is supported by trusted partners in preclinical research, development and validation of translational medicine biomarkers, clinical site management, and clinical development.

"Biobehavioral Predictors of Illness Progression in Adolescent Depression PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Adolescent depression is a major public health concern associated with significant morbidity and mortality. We know that adolescent depression varies considerably in severity and course, but its underlying mechanisms remain unknown. This proposal addresses this concern, aiming to identify biobehavioral predictors of illness trajectory in adolescents to inform treatment influencing its course. Our overall hypothesis is that reward dysfunction and its underlying neuro-immunological mechanisms contribute to maintenance of depression in youth. We propose the following model: (1) peripheral inflammation (e.g., cytokines, kynurenines) is associated with anhedonia; (2) inflammation extends to the CNS, inducing oxidative stress [↓glutathione (GSH, antioxidant)] and GABA (inhibitory neurotransmitter) deficits; (3) such neuro-chemical changes alter the reward circuitry, leading to anhedonia, and contribute to depression progression. In support, we documented that of adolescent depression’s core symptoms, only anhedonia—reflecting deficits in reward processes—and not irritability was associated with worse outcome, including suicidality and chronicity. We also reported associations between circulatory cytokines and kynurenines with both anhedonia and reward neurocircuitry. Utilizing proton MR spectroscopy (1H MRS), we showed that decreased anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) GABA in adolescent depression was driven by anhedonia. Additionally, using fMRI, we mapped striatal-based connectivity in relation to anhedonia and documented distinct neural activation patterns of reward anticipation and attainment—both reward processes that contribute to anhedonia. In pilot studies, we found that ACC GABA and reward- anticipation brain activation predicted anhedonia severity at 2-year follow-up. Building upon our compelling findings to date, we propose a prospective study of reward processes and neuroimmunological mechanisms, with the goal to identify modifiable pathways predictive of depression course in adolescents. We will study 120 adolescents with depressive symptoms. Three in-laboratory comprehensive clinical evaluation and computerized reward task sessions will be done at baseline, 12-, and 24-month follow-ups. At baseline and 12 months, visits will include: a) immune blood collection for kynurenine metabolites, immune cell profiling, and cytokine secretion post immune stimulation (as a biological stressor); b) fMRI resting state and tasks examining distinct reward processes (e.g., anticipation, attainment, learning); and c) 1H MRS to probe ACC GABA and striatal GSH as indices for inflammatory neurometabolic consequences in reward-related brain regions. Outcome measures will include anhedonia severity (primary), along with depression severity, functioning, anxiety, and suicidality. Principled variable selection approach will address multiple comparison concerns. Dynamic causal modeling and machine learning classification methods will explore the relationships among all examined factors.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Our overall goal is to better understand the mechanisms contributing to the maintenance and severity of adolescent depression. A prospective multimodal study will test the overall hypothesis that reward dysfunction and associated neuroimmunological abnormalities contribute to depression progression in youth. Such work would provide information on modifiable factors to facilitate novel treatment approaches influencing the course of illness early on and prior to chronicity effects, so that we may work to ameliorate morbidity and mortality of this devastating disorder.",Biobehavioral Predictors of Illness Progression in Adolescent Depression,10128500,R01MH120601,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Antioxidants ', ' anti-oxidant ', ' Anxiety ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' gamma-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' 4-Aminobutanoic Acid ', ' 4-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' 4-amino-butanoic acid ', ' Aminalon ', ' Aminalone ', ' GABA ', ' γ-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' Gambling ', ' Glutathione ', ' gamma-L-Glu-L-Cys-Gly ', ' gamma-L-Glutamyl-L-Cysteinylglycine ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Cetacort ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cortef ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortril ', ' Dermacort ', ' Eldecort ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Hytone ', ' Nutracort ', ' Proctocort ', ' Immunization ', ' Immunologic Sensitization ', ' Immunologic Stimulation ', ' Immunological Sensitization ', ' Immunological Stimulation ', ' Immunostimulation ', ' indexing ', ' Inflammation ', ' Kynurenine ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ', ' MR Spectroscopy ', ' Maintenance ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' neurochemistry ', ' neurochemical ', ' Neurotransmitters ', ' Nerve Transmitter Substances ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Protons ', ' H+ element ', ' Hydrogen Ions ', ' Puberty ', ' Public Health ', ' Rest ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stress ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' cytokine ', ' Measures ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' Mediating ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Anhedonia ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Anterior ', ' Peripheral ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Inflammatory ', ' depressed ', ' sadness ', ' Depressed mood ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Severities ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' pleasure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Sum ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Collection ', ' Immunologics ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologically ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' biobehavior ', ' biobehavioral ', ' reward circuitry ', ' computerized ', ' subthreshold depression ', ' child depression ', ' adolescent depression ', ' adolescents with depression ', ' childhood depression ', ' childhood onset depression ', ' depressed adolescents ', ' depression in adolescence ', ' pediatric depression ', ' youth depression ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Trauma ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' primary outcome ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' behavioral construct ', ' behavior construct ', ' causal model ', ' causal diagram ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' reward anticipation ', ' ']",NIMH,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,786200,NY-14
"Socioemotional Processing and Aggression Project Summary/Abstract Complex relationships exist between mental illness and aggression, particularly interpersonal aggression that can lead to antisocial behavior. Unfortunately, conducting high-impact mental health research among those who have committed serious aggressive acts against persons has been strategically challenging for many reasons. This research plan employs unique resources that enable advanced cognitive neuroscience research to be conducted in forensic environments. Here we leverage these resources to examine impaired functioning of neural circuits that contribute to specific varieties of serious aggressive behavior. Callous and unemotional traits, impulsive/disinhibited behavior, and appetitive desire to harm others, all have identifiable roots in neurocognitive function. We will examine how clinical levels of these latter traits are related to abnormalities in the neural circuits involved in affective perspective taking, moral decision-making, and behavioral inhibition. Normative neural responses for each of these processes have been well-characterized by our prior work. We seek to differentiate between unique pathophysiological etiologies that contribute to specific behavioral tendencies. We further aim to elucidate the modifying influence of early childhood trauma in these neurocognitive domains. Understanding these differences will promote more sophisticated prevention and intervention strategies that incorporate specific knowledge of neurocognitive vulnerabilities and remedial approaches for improving long-range outcomes for individuals and for the public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Aggressive behavior is a major public health concern that intersects with challenging venues of mental health research. This research plan implements unique resources to carry out cognitive neuroscience research among highly aggressive inmates with mental illnesses to differentiate among several etiological trajectories promoting these behaviors. The outcomes of this work will foster more sophisticated strategies for recognizing the potential for aggression and implementing more effective interventions, with the ultimate goal of preventing aggression and victimization in society.",Socioemotional Processing and Aggression,10067382,R01MH114028,"['Accounting ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Desire for food ', ' Appetite ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cognition ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emotions ', ' Empathy ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Forensic Medicine ', ' Forensics ', ' Goals ', ' Judgment ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentally Ill Persons ', ' Mentally Ill ', ' Methods ', ' Morals ', ' Motivation ', ' Multivariate Analysis ', ' Multivariate Analyses ', ' Persons ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Paraphilias ', ' Pathology ', ' Perception ', ' Public Health ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Societies ', ' Suggestion ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Work ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' morphometry ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Anterior ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Self Perception ', ' Personal awareness ', ' Self image ', ' Self view ', ' self awareness ', ' self knowledge ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' mental state ', ' mental status ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavior Control ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Victimization ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' criminal offender ', ' offender ', ' neural function ', ' Neurophysiology - biologic function ', ' antisocial ', ' anti social ', ' Ventral Striatum ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Brain region ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Mind Research ', ' Mind/Body Research ', ' mind-body research ', ' mind/body method ', ' Mind-Body Method ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' intervention for prevention ', ' prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' preventive intervention ', ' Cognitive ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' callous unemotional trait ', ' callousness ', ' pediatric trauma ', ' adolescent trauma ', ' childhood trauma ', ' trauma in children ', ' neglect ', ' Behavior monitoring ', ' behavioral monitoring ', ' Behavioral inhibition ', ' Outcome ', ' independent component analysis ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' Impairment ', ' Affective ', ' data structure ', ' cognitive control ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' treatment strategy ', ' neural patterning ', ' aggression prevention ', ' prevent aggression ', ' Secure ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' Social Processes ', ' antisocial behavior ', ' trait impulsivity ', ' Preventive measure ', ' Preventative measure ', ' Preventive treatment ', ' Preventative treatment ', ' symptomatology ', ' multimodal data ', ' multi-modal data ', ' multi-modal datasets ', ' multimodal datasets ', ' ']",NIMH,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2021,680832,NM-01
"Sensing Technologies for maternal depression treatment in low resource settings (StandStrong) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There is a high global burden of untreated postpartum depression. Untreated postpartum depression presents acute and long-term risks to a mother's mental and physical health, as well as her child's survival, health, and development. Although there is increasing willingness among funders and health systems to involve non- specialists, such as community health workers, in the delivery of psychological interventions for postpartum depression, the outcomes of these non-specialist interventions have been mixed. Digital technology, specifically the use of passive sensing data collection to learn more about a mother's life and support behavior change, has the potential to improve the effectiveness of psychological interventions delivered by non-specialists. For the proposed R21/R33, we will build on preliminary development work of Sensing Technologies for Maternal Depression Treatment in Low Resource Settings (StandStrong) to demonstrate feasibility, acceptability, and functionality for postpartum depression treatment in Nepal. StandStrong is a digital platform consisting of two mobile apps, internet-of-things (IoT) passive sensors, and a data analysis engine built using modern machine learning approaches. StandStrong incorporates passive sensing data collection from mothers and their infants that can be monitored by non-specialist counselors and then incorporated to better personalize psychological treatment. For Aim 1 (R21 phase), we will use human-centered design to iteratively refine the StandStrong platform and associated implementation material. For Aim 2 (R21 phase), we will evaluate the StandStrong platform and associated contents according to acceptability, feasibility, usage, benefit, and validity. If milestones are met for the R21, we will proceed to the R33 stage, in which we will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing a psychological treatment as usual with the psychological treatment supplemented by the StandStrong passive sensing platform with 112 depressed mothers (56 in each arm). For Aim 3 (R33 phase), we will identify parameters for sustainability and scalability through engagement of policy, healthcare, and telecom stakeholders, as well as costing the intervention and building mHealth research capacity. Successful completion contributes to the NIMH's 2020 Strategic Plan to tailor existing interventions and develop innovative service deliver for diverse populations. This project will contribute to NIMH's Opportunities and Challenges of Developing Information Technologies through improving treatment of mental illness through use of passive sensing technologies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Untreated postpartum depression impacts maternal morbidity and mortality and has long-term impacts on children's survival, mental and health physical health, and development. We will refine development of a digital platform that can be used by non-specialists to improve delivery of psychological interventions for postpartum depression by incorporating passive sensing data collected from a mobile phone and passive Bluetooth beacon with the mother and her infant.

"Sex hormones and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Project summary The untreated burden of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the United States is a massive contributor to healthcare budgets in both the military and civilian sectors, and better treatment and prevention methods are needed. Fortunately, awareness of PTSD among military service members has grown in recent years, and yet, there is a hidden epidemic of PTSD among civilians and women. Women experience PTSD at about twice the rate of men (11% vs. 5%), but the causes for this sex difference are largely unknown. It has long been suspected that sex hormones play a major role in development of – and also potentially protection from – PTSD and other mental health disorders. This project will provide the largest ever study of sex hormone effects on PTSD and the related mental health outcomes of depression and anxiety disorders. Whereas studies in the past were limited by small sample sizes and results were inconclusive, this investigation will use a massive sample size of approximately 500,000 participants to answer questions about two well-known sex hormones (testosterone and estradiol) and three psychiatric outcomes (PTSD, depression, and anxiety disorders). These variables were measured in the UK Biobank, and we have been granted access to the data to study sex hormone effects on mental health outcomes and to study genetic effects underlying both sex hormone levels and mental health disorders. The completion of this work will reveal whether rates of mental health disorders vary with testosterone and estradiol levels. It may be the case that levels of hormones that are both too high and too low are problematic. Given this reality, we will use sophisticated regression and machine learning techniques, and therefore we will be able to detect linear and non-linear relationships between sex hormones and PTSD, depression, and anxiety disorders. The sample size and study design make this the most powerful study conducted to date, and the results will be generalizable to diverse populations. In addition to the outcomes mentioned above, we will further explore genetic effects underlying relationships between sex hormones and mental health disorders. To do this, we will conduct genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of both testosterone and estradiol. We will then make polygenic scores for testosterone and estradiol, yielding genetic proxies of sex hormone levels which can be used in studies in which sex hormones have not been measured. Finally, we will test for shared genetic effects between genetic effects on sex hormones and genetic effects on psychiatric disorders in order to better understand the etiology of these common, debilitating, and inadequately treated mental health disorders. Taken together, these findings will provide critical foundational knowledge relevant to clinical trials which are currently testing testosterone and estradiol as treatments for PTSD, depression, and anxiety disorders. These results will also provide actionable findings for the development of novel treatment and prevention strategies. Project Narrative / Public Health Relevance Sex hormone altering medications are prescribed to over 40% of American adults, and yet the mental health consequences of sex hormones are still poorly understood. This project will be the largest ever investigation of sex hormone effects on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety disorders, and the results of this powerful study design will provide much-needed information relevant to the development of new treatment and prevention strategies.

"Risk modeling and shared decision making for postpartum depression PROJECT ABSTRACT Postpartum depression (PPD) is a strikingly common and potentially life-threatening mental health condition, affecting 1 in 5 mothers in the US. PPD poses serious health concerns, not only to mothers but also their children and the family. PPD has been associated with increased infant mortality, higher rates of hospitalizations, impaired mother-child attachment, developmental problems in children, and increased stress within families. However, in reality, women who are at high risk for depression during the childbearing years are usually neither identified nor treated. In addition, even when depression is detected by health professionals, women rarely obtain assistance, despite the wide availability of treatment choices. In this project, we plan to leverage large-scale, integrated electronic health record and claims from the New York City Clinical Data Research Network to develop automated, scalable risk prediction models for PPD. We will also develop a digital shared decision-making (SDM) tool for PPD treatment by working collaboratively with healthcare providers and patients. The PPD risk model and the digital SDM tool for PPD treatment developed in this STTR Phase I project will be used to conduct a future large, prospective, multi-site clinical effectiveness trial to test their feasibility and utility in routine clinical care of women during the postpartum period. PROJECT NARRATIVE Postpartum depression (PPD) is a strikingly common and potentially life-threatening mental health condition, affecting 1 in 5 mothers in the US. Successful identification of patients who are at the risk of PPD can lead potential clinical interventions for improving patient outcomes.
