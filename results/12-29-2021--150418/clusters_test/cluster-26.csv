"A Human-Mimetic AI System for Automatic, Passive and Objective Dietary Assessment A Human-Mimetic AI System for Automatic, Passive and Objective Dietary Assessment  Unhealthy diet is strongly linked to risks of chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and certain types of cancer. The Global Burden of Disease Study has found that, among the top 17 risk factors, poor diet is overwhelmingly the No. 1 risk factor for human diseases. Despite the strong connection between diet and health, unhealthy foods with large portion sizes are widely consumed. Currently, 68.5% of U.S. adults are overweight, among the highest in developed countries. The recent decline in U.S. life expectancy sent another alarming signal about the general health of the American people. Understanding how the diet-related risk factors affect people’s health and finding effective ways to empower them in improving lifestyle habits are among the most important tasks in public health. Unfortunately, dietary assessment in real-world settings has been exceedingly complex and inaccurate to implement. Technology is needed that allows researchers to assess dietary intake easily and accurately in real world settings so that effective intervention to manage obesity and related chronic diseases can be developed. We propose a biomedical engineering project to address the dietary assessment problem, taking advantage of advanced mathematical modeling, wearable electronics and artificial intelligence.  Our research team has been improving the ability to assess diet for over a decade. We have designed the eButton, a small wearable device pinned on clothes in front of the chest, capable of collecting image-based dietary data objectively and passively (i.e., without depending on subject’s self-report or volitional operation of the device). We have also developed algorithms to compute food volumes and nutrients from images. Since the eButton was developed, it has been used by many researchers in the U.S. and other countries for objective and passive diet-intake studies in both adults and children.  Despite the past successes, there have been two lingering critical problems associated with the objective and passive dietary assessment using wearable devices: 1) substantial manual efforts are required for researchers to visually examine image data to identify foods and estimate their volumes (portion sizes), and 2) there are privacy concerns about researchers’ viewing of participants’ real-life images. Although solving these problems could enable the eButton and other wearable devices for large-scale diet-intake studies, we were not able to find effective solutions until recently when Artificial intelligence (AI) emerged. Advanced AI systems, especially those based on deep learning, can be trained by large amounts of labeled data to produce results comparable or even superior to those produced by human in numerous fields of applications. AI technology is also a powerful tool for dietary assessment, potentially providing an ideal solution to the two previously mentioned problems. We thus propose to develop a human-mimetic AI system to recognize foods from images, estimate portion sizes, and find energy and nutrient values from a database in a fully automatic process. Using the AI approach, there will be no need for researchers to view participants’ real-life images, and the AI system well-respects individuals’ privacy because it is trained to recognizes human foods only, nothing else.  Currently, the performances of existing AI systems are limited by the extensive variety and high variability of human foods, insufficient training data, and difficulty in finding appropriate nutritional information from food databases. In this application, we propose a new strategy to personalize the AI system for each research participant using an advanced mathematical model of personal food choices. With this personalization step, the dimensionality of our envisioned AI system can be reduced drastically, and our goal of automatic, objective and passive dietary assessment can be reached realistically. We also propose to improve the electronic hardware and develop a biomimetic camera to enlarge the field of view for the eButton. Finally, we will conduct a thorough evaluation of the personalized AI system in real-world settings using human subjects. This research aims to apply advanced mathematical modeling, wearable electronics and artificial intelligence to evaluate individual’s energy and nutrient intake automatically and objectively.","A Human-Mimetic AI System for Automatic, Passive and Objective Dietary Assessment",10111099,R01DK127310,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bio-engineered ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bioengineering ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Dietetics ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Feedback ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Habits ', ' Health ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' care facilities ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Manuals ', ' Persons ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Play ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Technology ', ' Volition ', ' Privacy ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' infancy ', ' infantile ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' developed country ', ' developed nation ', ' developed nations ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Life ', ' Adopted ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Healthy diet ', ' balanced diet ', ' good diet ', ' Country ', ' American ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Nutrient ', ' Participant ', ' validation studies ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Dietary Assessment ', ' Thorace ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorax ', ' Chest ', ' Modeling ', ' Biological Mimetics ', ' Biomimetics ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' mimetics ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' Update ', ' Nutritional ', ' nutritious ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' Food Energy ', ' obesity management ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' cancer type ', ' Consumption ', ' human disease ', ' effective intervention ', ' operation ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' nutrition science ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' Unhealthy Diet ', ' poor diet ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' robotic system ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' overweight adults ', ' over-weight adults ', ' dietary ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,657303,PA-18
"Multiplex interrogation of neuromodulatory signaling in behaving animals with enhanced depth and resolution Project Summary The dynamic adaptability of the mammalian brain to environmental changes is remarkable, as it is the complexity of the networks of neurons underlying the operations that allow for such adaptations. Although we have some understanding of the anatomical and functional basis of this, we are still lacking a detailed picture of how the modulation of neuronal activity works. What is the timing and locations of these neuromodulator release and relationship with excitatory/inhibitory circuits? How does the neuromodulators circuitry accomplish the regulation of firing and synaptic properties of targeted neurons? Filling these gaps in knowledge would advance our understanding of all aspects of neuromodulator biology and allow discovery of new therapeutic strategies. To help close this gap, we have used creative approaches to the development of genetically encoded to directly report behaviorally triggered and modulated neuromodulator release including serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE). We have disseminated these indicators to the neuroscience community and spurred major discoveries of novel mechanisms regulating neuromodulator release underlying motivation and addiction. Build on this initial success, we propose to further expand the effectiveness of this toolbox of NM sensors to enable imaging sparse release at depth and subcellular resolution. Our specific goals are to (1) improve the sensitivity of our current sensors to enable robust imaging of sparse neuromodulator release, push their spatial resolution to the subcellular level and increase linearity of response at lower concentrations; (2) expand their spectral range to red/far-red to enhance imaging depth, SNR and in vivo multiplex measurement and manipulation of multiple circuit components using two or three distinct colors, and (3) characterize the possible interference of current sensors with endogenous signaling and systematically validate emerging sensors with a wide-ranging microscopy approaches in vivo. Our strategy relies on a dynamic collaboration between the sensor design team and end users to obtain continuous feedback to implement efficient improvements to the sensors. It is our goal to rapidly disseminate a wide range of well-characterized, highly sensitive indicators for the neuroscience community to be employed to study behaving mice, fish, flies and worms, to enrich our knowledge on the functional roles of neuromodulators in the brain circuitry. Altered neurotransmitter and neuromodulator (NM) signaling is a key feature of virtually all human neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, depression, and addiction. We will engineer, validate and disseminate optimized genetically encoded sensors for visualizing neuronal communication with enhanced depth and resolution using advanced microscopy techniques. Combined with optogenetics and calcium/voltage imaging, applications of these tools will reveal the full richness of neuromodulatory signaling to greatly extend, and potentially transform, our understanding of how neurochemical inputs influence cell and circuit function in health and disease.",Multiplex interrogation of neuromodulatory signaling in behaving animals with enhanced depth and resolution,10166304,U01NS120820,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Biology ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Calcium ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Color ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dopamine ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Endorphins ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Fishes ', ' Glutamates ', ' L-Glutamate ', ' glutamatergic ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Image Enhancement ', ' nerve supply ', ' innervation ', ' Microscopy ', ' Motivation ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' neurochemistry ', ' neurochemical ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurotransmitters ', ' Nerve Transmitter Substances ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Norepinephrine ', ' Levarterenol ', ' Levonorepinephrine ', ' Noradrenaline ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Peptides ', ' Photometry ', ' Robotics ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Serotonin ', ' 5-HT ', ' 5-Hydroxytryptamine ', ' 5HT ', ' Enteramine ', ' Hippophaine ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Opsin ', ' Rod-Opsin ', ' Measures ', ' Photons ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Microscopic ', ' Penetration ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Ensure ', ' Fiber ', ' Measurement ', ' Collaborations ', ' Directed Molecular Evolution ', ' directed evolution ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' scaffolding ', ' scaffold ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' extracellular ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' success ', ' transdisciplinary collaboration ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' voltage ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neurotransmitter release ', ' monoamine ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' G Protein-Complex Receptor ', ' G Protein-Coupled Receptor Genes ', ' GPCR ', ' G-Protein-Coupled Receptors ', ' Reporting ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Regulation ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Neuromodulator ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Brain region ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Ligand Binding ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' fly ', ' Flies ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' environmental change ', ' two-photon ', ' 2-photon ', ' virtual ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic strategies ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' minimally invasive ', ' operation ', ' optogenetics ', ' screening ', ' brain circuitry ', ' multiplexed imaging ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,U01,2021,869559,CA-03
"Multi-modal Health Information Technology Innovations for Precision Management of Glaucoma PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Glaucoma is the world's leading cause of irreversible blindness and will affect >110 million people by 2040. Early detection and treatment are critical, as symptoms typically do not present until the disease is advanced. A data-driven precision medicine approach is needed to better identify individuals who are at greatest risk of developing the disease and who are at greatest risk of progressing quickly to vision loss. While there has been considerable progress in eye imaging and testing to improve glaucoma monitoring, precision management of glaucoma is incomplete without accounting for patients' co-existing systemic conditions, concurrent systemic medications and treatments, and adherence with prescribed glaucoma treatment. Understanding how systemic conditions, and specifically vascular conditions such as hypertension, impact glaucoma presents growing public health importance given the increasing co-morbidities facing aging populations. Preliminary studies have demonstrated the predictive value of systemic data, even without ophthalmic endpoints. Similarly, measuring medication adherence is important for guiding patient counseling and engagement and avoiding downstream interventions such as surgeries, which carry high cost and morbidity. These factors are important for providing a more comprehensive perspective of glaucoma management and for improving patient outcomes, yet they are relatively understudied. I propose applying multi-modal advancements in health information technology (IT) to address these gaps and achieve the following specific aims: (1) Develop machine learning-based predictive models classifying patients at risk for glaucoma progression using systemic electronic health record (EHR) data from a diverse nationwide patient cohort; (2) evaluate how integrating blood pressure (BP) data from novel smartwatch-based home BP monitors enhance predictive models for risk stratification in glaucoma, and (3) measure glaucoma medication adherence using innovative flexible electronic sensors to validate their use for future interventions aimed at improving adherence and clinical outcomes in glaucoma. These studies would leverage state- of-the-art methods in big-data predictive modeling as well as cutting-edge advancements in sensor technologies. This multi-faceted approach will build a foundation for a health IT framework geared toward improving risk stratification and generating novel therapeutic targets for glaucoma patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE A precision medicine approach is critical for early detection and treatment of glaucoma, an insidious chronic eye disease that can lead to blindness and severely decreased quality of life. The relationship between systemic conditions and treatments with glaucoma progression, as well as methods for monitoring and promoting glaucoma medication adherence, represent areas of glaucoma management that are not well-understood and are thus critical opportunities for technology-driven interventions. This study proposes the development and application of multi- modal health information technology innovations – such as machine learning-based predictive modeling, massive electronic datasets, wearable devices, and flexible sensor electronics – to enhance understanding of glaucoma pathophysiology and identify new potential therapeutic strategies.",Multi-modal Health Information Technology Innovations for Precision Management of Glaucoma,10260459,DP5OD029610,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Award ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Counseling ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electronics ', ' electronic device ', ' Exhibits ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye diseases ', ' eye disorder ', ' ophthalmopathy ', ' Eyedrops ', ' Eye Drops ', ' Fellowship ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Glaucoma ', ' glaucomatous ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Institutes ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Smartphone-based mindfulness training for health following early life adversity PROJECT SUMMARY Over 25% of the US population reports exposure to early life adversity (ELA)—physical or emotional trauma or neglect in childhood. ELA predicts life-long health disparities, including increased risk for chronic cardiometabolic and autoimmune diseases and early mortality. Exposure to adversity in childhood is thought to program biological adaptations to stress that contribute to disease risk in adulthood. There are currently no evidence-based interventions to offset these risks in adulthood. Mindfulness meditation interventions have been effective for reducing stress and improving markers of physical health. However, it is unclear whether mindfulness interventions are acceptable and effective for improving health among people with a history of ELA. In a sample of emerging and young adults with a history of ELA, the proposed study evaluates feasibility of using smartphone-based mindfulness and control interventions and of measuring stress in daily life using ambulatory assessment and mobile sensor models with the long-term goal of implementing a stress-triggered just-in-time (JIT) mindfulness intervention in future research. Emerging/young adults with a history of ELA (n=80) will provide two weeks of baseline ambulatory stress ratings, continuous mobile sensor data (e.g., heart rate, activity, and location from wearable devices and smartphones), and blood samples to assess inflammatory biomarkers. Participants will then be randomly assigned to a 14-lesson smartphone-based (a) mindfulness training intervention or (b) matched coping control intervention, both boosted with randomly-delivered practice prompts to permit retrospective evaluation of JIT prompts. Ambulatory stress, sensor data, and inflammatory biomarkers will again be assessed at post-intervention and one-month follow-up. The following primary hypotheses will be tested: (1) interventions and assessments will be feasible in an ELA sample and (2) mindfulness training will improve daily life stress and inflammatory processes. Additionally, toward the design of a JIT mindfulness intervention, mobile sensor data will be used to develop machine-learning models predicting daily life stress, and practice prompts delivered at high stress moments will be evaluated for stress reduction benefit. To meet these aims, the candidate has assembled a mentorship team and training plan focused on (1) conceptual and methodological issues in ELA and health disparities, (2) advanced methods for assessing ambulatory and biological outcomes, and (3) new technology for optimizing outcome assessment and intervention delivery. Combined with the candidate’s background in mechanistic mindfulness research, the proposed research and training will launch an independent career dedicated to maximizing the efficacy of mindfulness interventions for addressing health disparities. These goals align with NCCIH’s objectives to advance understanding of complementary health interventions for improving health in at-risk populations using novel assessment technologies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Early life adversity—reported by over 25% of the US population—is thought to program biological adaptations to stress that contribute to life-long health disparities, including increased risk for chronic disease and early mortality. Interventions to offset these risks in adulthood are needed; mindfulness meditation interventions have been effective for reducing stress and improving markers of physical health, but whether they are acceptable and effective for improving health among people with a history of ELA remains unclear. From a public health perspective, establishing an evidence base for remote, just-in-time mindfulness interventions may help to address health disparities in a wide population.",Smartphone-based

"Immulogical Niches and Non-invasive Biosensors for Autoimmune Monitoring Multiple sclerosis is a demyelinating autoimmune disease that is difficult to manage clinically, because it is characterized by unpredictable periods of remission and relapse. If the disease could be adequately monitored, it is possible drugs could intervene to prevent damage, reducing rates of relapse and overall progression. Ideally, it would be possible to repeatedly biopsy the CNS for monitoring, but this is too challenging/morbid to have utility. Herein, we propose an approach that harnesses tissue engineering principles to develop an immunological niche (IN) in vivo to enable harvest of physiologically relevant immune populations. The central hypothesis of this work is that INs can be created to reflect aspects of the innate and/or adaptive immune system that correlate with the CNS. Furthermore, we hypothesize that INs will provide a location into which a non-invasive optical sensor of multiple sclerosis can be implanted. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that the FBR to implanted materials can be harnessed to create an IN reflective of innate immunity in the CNS and will dynamically monitor the formation of this niche. Scaffolds will be excised at appropriate time points during disease induction and analyzed with high-throughput gene expression arrays, scRNAseq, and machine learning to develop multivariate signatures capable of determining whether a mouse is diseased or healthy. Aim 2 (K99) will harness specific antigen-binding peptides to build noninvasive sensors for biomarkers of disease progression. Fluorophore-labeled peptides that specifically bind biomarkers of disease will be incorporated into PEG hydrogels which will be engineered such that the binding of the desired antigen will enable detection via FRET. These sensors will be incorporated into the pores of the IN to enable non-invasive monitoring of MS. Aim 3 (R00) will develop INs reflective of adaptive immune populations in the CNS, by incorporating antigens within the scaffolds. This section will create a non-invasive sensor and multivariate signature reflective of adaptive immune changes within the surrogates and harness both innate and adaptive INs to investigate mechanistic questions about innate-adaptive crosstalk in the development of MS. Taken together these studies will create engineered immunological niches and non-invasive sensors that enable the creation of enhanced diagnostics, prognostics, treatment monitors, and longitudinal immunology studies without euthanasia.  This work is at the intersection of immunology and biomaterials and will require biomaterials synthesis, scRNAseq, computational analysis, tissue engineering, immunology, and biosensor design and validation. The applicant has significant experience in biomaterials, tissue engineering, and the host response, but requires further training in immunology, computational analysis, and biosensor design/validation. Both this award and the advisory committee will provide the applicant tools and expertise to begin his career as an independent investigator. Furthermore, this work will develop new diagnostics, new techniques useful to the field as a whole, and contribute to an understanding of unanswered questions in innate-adaptive crosstalk in autoimmunity. Project Narrative Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease characterized by immune infiltrate into the CNS and subsequent damage to myelin, that is difficult to diagnose and monitor because the site for disease cannot be readily biopsied for analysis. The goal of this proposal is to create engineered immunological niches and corresponding non- invasive sensors that will correlate with the innate or adaptive immune responses during disease onset and progression by implanting engineered scaffolds in the subcutaneous space.

"SCH: Multidimensional Microfluidic Salivary Sensor with Adversarial Knowledge Distillation for Point-of-Care Assessment of Periodontitis and Comorbidities The goal of this research is to develop a sensor device prototype to rapidly measure an array of diverse salivary biomarkers as input for novel machine learning (ML) methods that can predict periodontitis and monitor periodontal progression. Our long-term goal is to develop a rapid, user-friendly, and low-cost pointof-care (POC) device, for use in either a dentist’s office or at home, that rapidly integrates and analyzes data to support patient management. It addresses the priority area of the Data Science, Computational Biology, and Bioinformatics Program of NIDCR in integrating and analyzing high-volume and diverse data to better understand dental, oral, and craniofacial biology and diseases. According to the CDC, nearly 50% adults have some form of periodontal disease. Perioodontitis is silently progressive and patients often seek professional care only in an advanced stage where advanced, painful and costly procedures are needed to control disease or replace lost teeth. Early detection of periodontal disease at an individual patient level is required and there is growing awareness that multiple biomarkers are valued in predicting risk of disease in individuals. We hypothesize that predictive models can be established based on the measurements of a large set of periodontitis-associated biomarkers in saliva; a sensor device that integrates multi-sensor modalities and the machine learning (ML) models will advance the clinical goal of early diagnosis of periodontitis to enable earlier clinical interventions. Thus, we will develop and apply three distinctive sensor modalities for detecting concentrations of salivary analytes relevant to various stages of periodontal progression, i.e., inflammation, soft tissue destruction or bone destruction (Aim 1). Data from both sensor outputs and clinical examination will be used to train ML models via a novel multi-modal adversarial knowledge distillation ML framework, which promotes accurate early prediction with partial longitudinal data representations (Aim 2). The multi-sensor modalities and the ML models will be embedded in a single microfluidic device, incorporating steps such as sampling, detection, and data analysis as an integrated lab-on-a-chip, and permitting the sensor data preprocessed to transmit only the actionable information to the outside platform to protect the user's privacy (Aim 3). Such a device is anticipated to offer for unobtrusive, accurate, and frequent saliva-based self-monitoring, and provide detailed medical data to support clinical decisions. It will be an effective tool for future personalized medicine and dramatically improve patients' oral health. The primary objective of the proposed project is to develop a saliva-based biosensor by integrating research advances in sensing elements, machine learning, data analysis, microfluidics and communications for periodontal disease prediction which has high public health relevance. We will establish predictive models for periodontitis based on data from both sensor and patient. The new device will be useful for saliva-based self-monitoring for periodontitis and other oral or systemic diseases to improve the patient's overall health.",SCH: Multidimensional Microfluidic Salivary Sensor with Adversarial Knowledge Distillation for Point-of-Care Assessment of Periodontitis and Comorbidities,10438075,R01DE031832,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Awareness ', ' Biology ', ' bone ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Communication ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Dentists ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Inflammation ', ' Learning ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Periodontal Diseases ', ' Parodontosis ', ' periodontal disorder ', ' periodontium disease ', ' periodontium disorder ', ' Periodontitis ', ' Chronic Periodontitis ', ' Research ', ' Saliva ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Students ', ' Tooth structure ', ' Tooth ', ' teeth ', ' Measures ', ' Privacy ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' Label ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' teacher ', ' soft tissue ', ' Dental ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Prediabetes ', ' Prediabetic State ', ' pre-diabetes ', ' pre-diabetic ', ' prediabetic ', ' Prediabetes syndrome ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' computer biology ', ' Computational Biology ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Oral ', ' Salivary ', ' System ', ' empowered ', ' craniofacies ', ' craniofacial ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' solid state ', ' microbial ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' miniaturize ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disease control ', ' disorder control ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' µfluidic ', ' Microfluidics ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Lab On a Chip ', ' Lab-On-A-Chips ', ' Microfluidic Device ', ' Microfluidic Lab-On-A-Chip ', ' microfluidic chip ', ' Microfluidic Microchips ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' NIDCR ', ' NIDR ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' Collection ', ' Monitor ', ' point of care ', ' Output ', ' oral care ', ' cost ', ' care systems ', ' care services ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' nanopore ', ' nano pore ', ' nanoparticle ', ' nano particle ', ' nano-sized particle ', ' nanosized particle ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' user-friendly ', ' prototype ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' Secure ', ' signal processing ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' Data Science ', ' individual patient ', ' inflammatory bone loss ', ' liquid biopsy ', ' procedure cost ', ' procedural costs ', ' clinical decision support ', ' deep learning ', ' diverse data ', ' data diversity ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' clinical examination ', ' clinical exam ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIDCR,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,299999,IL-01
"Effects of Orally Administered Nicotinamide Riboside on Bioenergetic Metabolism, Oxidative Stress and Cognition in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Mild Alzheimer's Dementia Project Summary/Abstract  This study will serve as a supplement to the current NIA funded study “Effects of Orally Administered Nicotinamide Riboside (NR) on Bioenergetic Metabolism, Oxidative Stress and Cognition in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Mild Alzheimer’s Dementia”. The primary study will assess the effect of NR supplementation on oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) levels and downstream markers of mitochondrial function and oxidative stress in the brain of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). The study will use NAD+ and redox ratio changes as the primary outcome and changes in CK/ATPase activity and glutathione levels in the brain as the secondary outcome. The parent study will also assess the impact of NR supplementation on mood and functioning as measured by standardized tests of mood, cognition, and daily functioning. However, these outcome measures for these markers of clinical and functional status are all self- or observer-reported measures that are subject to associated limitations, including fewer data points, recall bias, responder bias, require the presence and engagement of an observer, and include no measures to capture variations using continuous measurement in vivo.  We propose a novel approach to augment the current outcome measures with continuous sensor data to facilitate digital phenotyping of functioning and mood using a sensor called Emerald. Emerald uses radio signals to map motion, spatial location and sleep patterns in patients with AD and requires no direct interaction or contact and can collect continuous passive behavioral data. Customized machine-learning algorithms will extract (i) sleep efficiency, (ii) gait speed, and (iii) diurnal rhythm. The Emerald device can also track spatial location within the living environment and quantify levels and patterns of motion, which in turn are markers of psychomotor activity. These variables will facilitate a continuous, temporally dense and highly ecologically valid assessment of day-to-day variations in functioning to augment the data currently being collected. Sensor data will also allow continuous longitudinal mapping of behavioral/functional changes and comparison of trends of change in each individual variable.  We will deploy the Emerald device in the living environment of consenting study subjects and collect data on sleep and behavior for the duration of their enrolment in the parent trial. While the study requires visits at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks, the Emerald will track functioning and mood between visits, chronological patterns of behavior, and functional change in response to NR administration. The Emerald device will be deployed in forty study participants. Due to the small sample size, this is exploratory, but the data generated using digital phenotyping will enable us to develop and test hypotheses about the relationship between NR supplementation, bioenergetics/oxidative stress, imaging markers, and real-world functioning/clinical outcomes in future studies of AD and mild cognitive impairment. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Emerald device passively gathers continuous data on motion, spatial location, psychomotor activity, and sleep patterns in patients with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), allowing longitudinal mapping of their behavioral and functional changes over time. Machine learning algorithms will extract patients’ sleep efficiency, gait speed, and diurnal rhythms to assess changes in their behavior and functioning, capturing in vivo variations possibly attributable to nicotinamide riboside (NR) supplementation. This administrative supplement will enable us to develop and test hypotheses about the relationship between NR supplementation, bioenergetics and oxidative stress, imaging markers, and real-world functioning/clinical outcomes that will benefit future studies of AD.","Effects of Orally Administered Nicotinamide Riboside on Bioenergetic Metabolism, Oxidative Stress and Cognition in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Mild Alzheimer's Dementia",10394467,R01AG066670,"['ATP phosphohydrolase ', ' ATPase ', ' Adenosine Triphosphatase ', ' Adenosinetriphosphatase ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Bed Occupancy ', ' bed days ', ' Behavior ', ' Bioenergetics ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Chronology ', ' Cognition ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Glutathione ', ' gamma-L-Glu-L-Cys-Gly ', ' gamma-L-Glutamyl-L-Cysteinylglycine ', ' Maps ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Moods ', ' Motion ', ' Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ', ' Dihydronicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide ', ' Diphosphopyridine Nucleotide ', ' Nadide ', ' Nicotinamide-Adenine Dinucleotide ', ' NADH ', ' Persons ', ' Oxidation-Reduction ', ' Redox ', ' oxidation reduction reaction ', ' Oxides ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Sleep ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' nicotinamide-beta-riboside ', ' nicotinamide ribonucleoside ', ' nicotinamide ribose ', ' nicotinamide riboside ', ' Measures ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' Hour ', ' Oral ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Visit ', ' functional status ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Participant ', ' Study Subject ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' assisted living ', ' assistive living ', ' assistive living facilities ', ' Assisted Living Facilities ', ' Radio ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' digital ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' daily functioning ', ' Outcome ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' standardize measure ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' Gait speed ', ' serial imaging ', ' longitudinal imaging ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' functional independence ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' sleep behavior ', ' sleep habit ', ' Diurnal Rhythm ', ' diurnal variation ', ' sleep pattern ', ' COVID-19 ', ' COVID19 ', ' CV-19 ', ' CV19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' nicotinamide riboside supplementation ', ' ']",NIA,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2021,313981,MA-05
"Device to control circadian-effective light in Alzheimer's disease environments Project Summary This proposed project will develop and field-test a device that accurately monitors and controls the circadian stimulus (CS) for Alzheimer disease (AD) and Alzheimer-disease-related dementia (ADRD) patients in nursing homes. Human biology has evolved to have two distinct optical systems: the visual system, by which we see and process images, and the circadian system, which regulates our biological clock and associated biological systems. These two systems have significantly different spectral and temporal responses to optical input. Specifically, circadian stimulation peaks at 460 nm and responds after several minutes of optical activation, while the visual system peaks at 555 nm and responds nearly instantaneously to inputs. All lighting systems are designed and installed in buildings with consideration only given to the photopic (visual) system and all light meters used to characterize lighting buildings are calibrated to measure photopic light, not CS. While a broad and growing body of research has documented the impacts of the circadian system on human health, including regulating sleep and improving cognition in AD/ADRD patients, research on the CS experienced by AD/ADRD patients is extremely limited. Researchers at the Lighting Research Center at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute developed the Daysimeter, a calibrated light meter that measures circadian light and circadian stimulus. In Phase I of this project, researchers modified an existing workstation-based lighting control system they previously developed for the visual system to include Daysimeter technology, allowing this control system to record CS measurements. The accuracy of these CS measurements was confirmed in the laboratory and field-testing of 20 of devices is currently ongoing in AD/ADRD nursing homes. In this Phase II application, researchers propose adding control features to this device so that lighting can be controlled to optimize CS dosages in AD/ADRD patient environments. Machine learning-based lighting control algorithms will be driven by continuous light level and spectrum measurements as well as periodic (e.g., daily) patient health data. Data from these devices would be wirelessly transmitted to researchers via an Internet gateway and associated cloud-based data management systems. These data would be of immediate value for gaining a better understanding of AD/ADRD patients' CS exposure and could ultimately result in new lighting systems and/or building codes that consider both our visual and circadian systems. Following the development phase, 30 CS-enabled lighting control systems will be field tested over a 22-week test period. Researchers aim to commercialize this CS-enabled lighting control system shortly after the completion of this field test and the Phase II project specifically targeting AD/ADRD nursing home applications. Project Narrative A growing body of research has demonstrated how light impacts human circadian systems and how these impacts can affect sleep, alertness, cognition and agitation in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's-disease-related dementia (ADRD). Still, significant knowledge gaps exist in determining how much circadian stimulation is typically provided to AD/ADRD patients and there are no commercial products designed to control lighting in AD/ADRD environments in ways that promote circadian-related health. This project aims to fill in these gaps by developing and testing a device specifically designed to measure and control the circadian stimulation experienced by AD/ADRD patients in nursing homes.",Device to control circadian-effective light in Alzheimer's disease environments,10448533,R44AG060857,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Clocks ', ' Biologic Clock ', ' body clock ', ' internal clock ', ' Building Codes ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' Database Management Systems ', ' Data Base Management ', ' Data Base Management Systems ', ' database management ', ' database systems ', ' relational database management systems ', ' Environment ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Lighting ', ' Illumination ', ' Moods ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Patients ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Phototherapy ', ' Actinotherapy ', ' Light Therapy ', ' Photoradiation Therapy ', ' light treatment ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Retina ', ' Rotation ', ' Running ', ' Sleep ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Wakefulness ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Agitation ', ' Psychomotor Agitation ', ' Psychomotor Excitement ', ' Psychomotor Hyperactivity ', ' Psychomotor Restlessness ', ' Restlessness ', ' falls ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Stimulus ', ' awake ', ' Visual ', ' residence ', ' residential building ', ' residential site ', ' Measurement ', ' Planet Earth ', ' Earth ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hour ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' meter ', ' interest ', ' Visual System ', ' Visual system structure ', ' experience ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Human Biology ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' alertness ', ' Dose ', ' Feeds ', ' Data ', ' device development ', ' instrument development ', ' Device or Instrument Development ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' wireless ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' active control ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Population ', ' circadian pacemaker ', ' circadian clock ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' biological systems ', ' cloud based ', ' health data ', ' circadian ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' appropriate dose ', ' optimal drug dosage ', ' optimal drug dose ', ' effectiveness testing ', ' ']",NIA,"BLUE IRIS LABS, INC.",R44,2021,18000,CA-02
"HEALing LB3P: Profiling Biomechanical, Biological and Behavioral phenotypes Project Summary Identifying the optimal treatment for chronic low back pain (CLBP), the most prevalent of painful musculoskeletal disorders, on a patient-specific basis is an important and unresolved challenge. Tailoring interventions according to patient movement characteristics may improve clinical outcomes. Multi-modal studies are underway to characterize CLBP patients and to provide insight into the phenotypes associated with the experience of CLBP in relation to direct targeted and improved treatments. Comprehensive assessment of lumbar spine movement CLBP patients may be an important facet of such treatments such that patient-specific spine biomechanics may be included in predictive models to improve the ability to characterize them. To that end, the purpose of this administrative supplement is to explore additional clinical tools for characterizing lumbopelvic kinematics during functional tasks and daily activities. Specifically, this work aims to develop computer vision methods with which to characterize motions of the lumbar spine, thereby providing an accurate and unobtrusive clinical tool that can be used to supplement or replace currently considered tools such as wearable sensors, handheld sensors, and complex marker-based motion capture systems. This project will use video, marker-based 3D video motion capture data, and wearable inertial measurement data to create and validate single-camera computer-vision algorithms that can be used to compute known clinical metrics. During clinical assessments of patients in the Pitt LB3P Biomechanics Core study, participants are asked to perform functional tasks (e.g., repeated flexion/extension, axial rotation, lateral bending, lifting, chair rises) while wearing inertial measurement units (IMUs) attached to the upper back at T1, low back at L1 and L5, and thigh. The functional performance exams are also recorded by video. The standard metrics determined from these trials will include maximum and minimum lumbar spine and hip ROM, angular velocity at mid-excursion, maximum rotation acceleration, and phase angles for lumbar and hip joint rotation. The goal of this supplemental proposal is to use collected data to develop and train computer vision algorithms (so-called markerless motion capture) to quantify the metrics of interest. Use of video is much simpler for clinicians as it avoids the setup process required by wearable sensors. Recent developments in markerless motion capture have enabled simple camera systems to provide quantitative information about human motions but few studies have assessed computer vision for use in the clinical setting. The research plan in this proposal involves the use of existing data to train and validate computer vision algorithms, and then to further investigate their use in the clinical setting with single camera video to determine the extent to which video-based markerless motion capture may be clinically useful in the assessment of CLBP patients. Project Narrative Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a common musculoskeletal disorder with major public health and socioeconomic impacts. A clinical measure that is used to characterize and ultimately prescribe treatment is the extent to which a patient has difficulty executing physical activities, but making reliable quantified measurements of patient motions can be challenging with conventional tools and even with modern motion capture systems. This research will investigate the degree to which a simple camera may be used in conjunction with machine-learning based computer vision algorithms to provide patient motion during physical activities that can be used in the assessment and treatment of CLBP.","HEALing LB3P: Profiling Biomechanical, Biological and Behavioral phenotypes",10415626,U19AR076725,"['Acceleration ', ' Algorithms ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' E-learning ', ' computer-assisted instruction ', ' computer-based education ', ' computer-based instruction ', ' computer-based learning ', ' computer-based training ', ' digital education ', ' digital learning ', ' eLearning ', ' electronic learning ', ' internet-assisted education ', ' internet-based training ', ' multimedia learning ', ' on-line education ', ' on-line learning ', ' online education ', ' online learning ', ' technology-enhanced learning ', ' virtual learning ', ' web-based instruction ', ' web-based training ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Goals ', ' Hip region structure ', ' Coxa ', ' Hip ', ' Hip Joint ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Musculoskeletal Diseases ', ' musculoskeletal disorder ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Rotation ', ' Vertebral column ', ' Spinal Column ', ' Spine ', ' backbone ', ' Thigh structure ', ' Thigh ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Lifting ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' insight ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' kinematic model ', ' kinematics ', ' Participant ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' healing ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Chronic low back pain ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable biosensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' pain patient ', ' optimal treatments ', ' optimal therapies ', ' behavioral phenotyping ', ' behavior phenotype ', ' ']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U19,2021,134064,PA-18
"Personalized Deep Learning Models of Rapid Changes in Major Depressive Disorder Symptoms using Passive Sensor Data from Smartphones and Wearable Devices ABSTRACT Major depressive disorder (MDD) is highly prevalent and the leading cause of global disease burden. Associated with over 1,000 different symptom profiles, MDD is highly heterogeneous. The majority of MDD symptom change occurs across hours. Consequently, there is a need to increasingly focus MDD research on personalized assessment of these rapid symptom fluctuations. To date, personalized models of MDD have shown promise, but relied solely on self-report measures. There is thus a critical need to develop personalized models of MDD that incorporate objective signals. Passively collected information from smartphones and wearable sensors can continuously and unobtrusively track behavioral and physiological signals related to core disturbances associated with MDD, including psychomotor retardation, sleep disturbances, social contact, behavioral activation, heart rate variability, and screen time. Preliminary data suggest that personalized artificial intelligence (i.e., personally weighted deep learning models) are well suited for creating novel personalized digital biomarkers of these passive indicators, and that these biomarkers can predict rapid changes in MDD symptoms. This proposal will investigate the ability to develop personalized deep learning models of rapid changes in MDD symptoms among a nationally representative sample of 120 treatment seeking adults with MDD across 90 days using passively collected data from smartphones and wearable sensors. This proposal aims to test the accuracy of personalized, subtyped, and cohort-based modeling techniques and uncover personalized digital biomarkers of moment-to-moment changes in MDD symptoms. The project proposes the following innovations: it will (1) conduct the first passive-sensing study of MDD in a nationally-representative cohort; (2) utilize deep learning models to aid in the discovery of novel maintenance factors of MDD symptom changes; and (3) use personalized multimodal assessments of MDD to address the heterogeneity in MDD. In line with the aims of the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), this project will study MDD symptom changes across multiple units of analysis and integrate multiple systems. This study will provide a critical step towards uncovering novel personalized maintenance patterns of MDD symptom changes in daily life. Further, it will allow for scalable personalized treatments to be developed using technology to deliver behavioral interventions in the moments immediately preceding rapid MDD symptom changes. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to utilize personalized artificial intelligence techniques and objective data (collected from smartphones and wearable devices) to create individualized digital biomarkers of rapid changes in major depressive disorder symptoms. This is important because, if we were to uncover personalized patterns between objectively measured physiology and behavioral changes and understand their resulting impact on rapid fluctuations in major depressive disorder symptoms, we would be able to define new, person-specific maintenance patterns that underlie the wide-ranging heterogeneity that is currently seen in patients suffering from major depressive disorder. Moreover, these advancements will provide a crucial step forward towards developing personalized, scalable, technology-based interventions that will be able to be delivered immediately (and, ideally, before rapid symptom changes) among those persons with major depressive disorder.",Personalized Deep Learning Models of Rapid Changes in Major Depressive Disorder Symptoms using Passive Sensor Data from Smartphones and Wearable Devices,10229551,R01MH123482,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Arousal ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Maintenance ', ' Moods ', ' Persons ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' Research ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Sleep ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' aberrant sleep ', ' disrupted sleep ', ' disturbed sleep ', ' impaired sleep ', ' irregular sleep ', ' sleep disruption ', ' sleep dysregulation ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' Photoplethysmography ', ' Light Reflection Rheography ', ' Photoreflexometries ', ' Photoreflexometry ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' analog ', ' Exposure to ', ' depressed ', ' sadness ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Life ', ' Hour ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' meetings ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' treatment planning ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' social ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' actigraph ', ' actigraphy ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Subgroup ', ' Collection ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' tv watching ', ' screen time ', ' television watching ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' digital ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' heart rate variability ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' Positive Valence ', ' Negative Valence ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' phenomenological models ', ' phenomenology ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' biomarker-driven ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable biosensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' deep learning ', ' microphone ', ' ']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2021,493784,NH-02
"Ghost in the Machine: Melding Brain, Computer and Behavior Implantable devices are playing a greater role in neurologic care, but their effectiveness is limited, because they are blind to human thoughts, feelings, and behavior – factors that most dramatically affect our health. Coupling peripheral sensors to implants might help, but wouldn’t it be easier if the devices just asked us? Armed with this knowledge, next generation machines will more effectively drive neural activity in the brain to healthy states. They will also quickly learn behaviors that worsen health and guide us to better choices. Though DARPA, the NIH, and Neuralink are spending millions of dollars on new hardware for brain-computer interfaces, none focus on reciprocal, natural communication between host and machine. There is a desperate need for novel, practical methods that enable devices to learn from and guide human behavior.  In this application I propose to develop a new generation of autonomous brain-machine interfaces – devices that can question, record, act - and combine learning algorithms applied to neurosignals with teaching by their human hosts. Life with these implants will entail a subtle human- machine dialogue in which devices and humans teach and learn from each other. Humans will inform intelligent algorithms about what we are doing and feeling, while machines will incorporate this information into therapy and guide us to optimize quality of life in personalized ways. This is a paradigm shift from today’s simple devices, which are programmed by physicians during occasional office visits. I propose to demonstrate this paradigm in a practical, scalable way using current epilepsy implants that is rapidly translatable to many neurological disorders.  To achieve this goal, I will meld several cutting-edge technologies in novel ways, including: (1) State-of-the-art, high bandwidth implantables that sample neural activity, link to vast cloud- based computational power to process it, and intervene to modulate brain, spinal cord or peripheral neural activity. This work utilizes my experience from the past 20 years; (2) I will deploy powerful new computer science tools in novel ways. I will use convolutional neural nets (a.k.a. Deep Learning) to learn patterns from vast streams of continuous high-bandwidth neural data, build a two way human-machine interface using Natural Language Processing (NLP)., and probe networks with changes in human behavior and electrical stimulation and guide interventions toward therapeutic goals using Reinforcement Learning. Combining these computer science, machine learning techniques and measurements of human behavior is a new area of investigation for me that will leverage my unique background in clinical neurology and engineering to build a new class of interactive, human therapeutic devices. The goal of this project is to develop a revolutionary, new generation of implantable neurodevices that will communicate with, learn from, and teach their human hosts to better treat disease. Current implantable devices are blind to human actions, thoughts and behavior, which limits their effectiveness. State of the art computer techniques that can measure behavior and link them to brain activity will empower patients to teach, control and learn from their devices to improve health and quality of life.","Ghost in the Machine: Melding Brain, Computer and Behavior",10267167,DP1NS122038,"['Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communication ', ' Computers ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electric Stimulation ', ' Electrical Stimulation ', ' electrostimulation ', ' Engineering ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' implantable device ', ' biomedical implant ', ' implant device ', ' indwelling device ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurology ', ' Office Visits ', ' physician office visit ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Spinal Cord ', ' Medulla Spinalis ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Technology ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' User-Computer Interface ', ' human computer interface ', ' human machine interface ', ' man machine interface ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Caring ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Peripheral ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Link ', ' Measurement ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Stream ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' computer science ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' next generation ', ' brain computer interface ', ' brain machine interface ', ' blind ', ' Coupling ', ' Implant ', ' learned behavior ', ' learning behavior ', ' cloud based ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' learning algorithm ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,DP1,2021,1137500,PA-03
"Effective, Reagent-free Detection of the Odor Signature of Covid-19 Infection Using a Nano-Enabled Sensor Array PROJECT SUMMARY COVID-19 presents a public health emergency: There is a critical need for rapid, not reagent intensive, non- invasive testing technologies. This program will lead to the production of a prototype system to diagnose COVID-19 infection using the body odor signature of the disease. Our goal is to maximize societal impact by creating a validated prototype that can be used in a community or workplace setting by minimally trained personnel for low-cost, on-the-spot diagnosis within minutes. The system will be developed in a manner that puts it on a pathway for rapid FDA approval. The Research Aims are: Aim 1. Optimization, assembly, and integration of a prototype system with the ability to odor signature of COVID-19 in samples of body odor. The system will be simple to use, pose essentially zero risk to the operator and the test subject, and report a result within minutes. The production cost at scale will be approximately $9,000 for the complete measurement system, with a per test cost of approximately $0.50. The design and construction of the prototype will be conducted by Novo Engineering, a leading firm with extensive experience in medical device development. Aim 2. Software development. Software for the system from VOC sampling to final diagnostic result will be developed to ensure error-free operation of the device. Our preliminary results suggest that simple linear discriminant analysis (LDA) does an excellent job of classifying VOCs from human body odor as COVID-19 positive or negative (92% sensitivity and 87% specificity). Optimization of the sensor array (Aim 1) and use of richer feature sets in our classifier models will lead to further performance improvements in the prototype system. Aim 3. System Benchmarking and Validation. We will benchmark the full prototype system against a number of VOC mixtures, with and without in vitro skin models. The system will undergo extensive testing against body odor samples from individuals with pathological conditions other than COVID-19 and other sources of potentially confounding VOCs. The prototype will be validated against 1000 samples drawn from the COVID-SAFE program at Penn. The screening will include all members of the Penn community, and represents incredible racial and ethnic diversity as well as a wide variance in age, sex, and gender. Aim 4. Regulatory Approval Plan The plan will be developed under the direction of Sr/Key personnel John Fuson, JD, an attorney at Crowell & Moring LLP and a former Associate Chief Counsel at FDA. Novo Engineering has extensive experience in guiding prototype design in alignment with the requirements for FDA approval. The proposed COVID-19 VOC-based testing device will be regulated by the FDA, likely as a Class I or II medical device. Because there is no clear predicate device to reference in this case, we intend to submit a direct de novo petition to FDA asking the agency to categorize and clear the proposed COVID-19 testing device as Class I or Class II without reference to any predicate. PROJECT NARRATIVE This program addresses the critical unmet need of an effective means to screen for COVID-19 infection, and potentially other novel virus infections, in a community setting based upon the body odor signature of the disease. The program will result in a validated prototype system, with a test time of minutes, a test cost of approximately $0.50, on a path to rapid FDA approval.","Effective, Reagent-free Detection of the

"EAT: A Reliable Eating Assessment Technology for Free-living Individuals. Project Summary/Abstract Overeating and unhealthy eating are often associated with various health risk conditions such as obesity, high blood pressure, and some chronic diseases. To get a better understanding of overeating and unhealthy eating, researchers often rely on self-reports provided by individuals. Suggestions regarding changing lifestyle is often provided based on observations from these self-reports. However, it is well known that self-reports can be erroneous and subject to reporting biases. Thus, an objective way to measure the eating activity and validating self-reports is necessary. Recently, there has been growing interest in moving beyond self-reports and monitoring the eating activity automatically. To monitor automatically, and in real time, researchers have looked at using sensor data from wrist worn devices, neck-worn devices, or ear-worn devices to automatically detect eating. These devices often enable capturing the eating periods. However, these devices seldom capture images, thus limiting the possibility of visually confirming the consumed food and their quantity. With the increasing popularity of wearable cameras, it is gradually becoming possible to capture the eating activities and associated context automatically and without any user intervention. Advances in machine learning enables automatically extracting eating related information from these captured images. However, wearable cameras often capture more information than necessary, like capturing bystanders. This unnecessary information capturing reduces participant's willingness to wearing the camera. Currently, no camera exists that can capture the eating activity and at the same time limit capturing unnecessary information. Obfuscating the unnecessary information might increase participant's willingness to wear the camera. However, it is unclear if and which obfuscation technique will increase participant's willingness to don the wearable camera and at the same time ensure automatic context determination. In this project, we will determine the possibility of using machine learning to detect eating in videos and identify the obfuscation technique that can allow detecting the eating activity without collecting unnecessary information. To this end, first we will develop an activity detection algorithm that will allow detecting the eating activity using data from an IR sensor array and RGB images. Next, we will test various obfuscation methods in a cross-over trial and select the best obfuscation method based on the greatest participant acceptability. We will then deploy the eating detection algorithm with the best obfuscation approach on a novel wearable camera that has an infrared sensor array. We will use this camera to test the possibility of detecting eating in a real-world setting. To validate our algorithm, we will ask people to confirm or refute predicted eating and non-eating moments. We will compare the performance of this algorithm against both real-time user response and 24-hour dietary recall to objectively evaluate the algorithm's performance. Our proposed system will improve current research practices of evaluating dietary intake and pave the way for personalized interventions for behavioral medicine. Project Narrative Monitoring an individual's eating behavior will provide detailed understanding of the causal relationship between the eating activity and conditions such as problematic eating and obesity. Manual self-reports are often erroneous and biased. The availability of wearable video cameras makes it possible to objectively capture the eating activity. However, manually observing video frames to obtain the objective measure of eating is burdensome. Additionally, wearable video cameras pose privacy concerns in real-world settings. To overcome these challenges, we are developing an automated eating detection system to monitor real-time eating behavior via a privacy-conscious wearable device that individuals will wear. We will confirm eating activities in real time. Such automatic and privacy-conscious real-time eating detection will allow us to advance our understanding of the eating activity, laying the foundation for future interventions to change problematic eating behaviors.",EAT: A Reliable Eating Assessment Technology for Free-living Individuals.,10280789,R01DK129843,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Medicine ', ' Bite ', ' Energy Intake ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Cartoons ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Cues ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Ear ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Controlled Environment ', ' artificial environment ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Female ', ' Fishes ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Gestures ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Hyperphagia ', ' Overeating ', ' polyphagia ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Incentives ', ' Crystalline Lens ', ' Eye Lens ', ' Ocular Lens ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Locales ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Names ', ' Neck ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Privatization ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Suggestion ', ' Technology Assessment ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Video Recording ', ' Videorecording ', ' video recording system ', ' Weight Gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' wt gain ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' Privacy ', ' Surrogate Markers ', ' surrogate bio-markers ', ' surrogate biomarkers ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Ensure ', ' Conscious ', ' Consciousness ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' diet intervention ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hour ', ' Calories ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Agreement ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Thorace ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorax ', ' Chest ', ' response ', ' miniaturize ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Dietary intake ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' BMI ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Monitor ', ' sex ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' food consumption ', ' tv watching ', ' screen time ', ' television watching ', ' willingness ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' hedonic ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' emotional eating ', ' emotional eater ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' Cross-Over Trials ', ' Crossover Trials ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' smart watch ', ' smartwatch ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' preservation ', ' real time monitoring ', ' realtime monitoring ', ' detection platform ', ' detection system ', ' dietary ', ' ']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,701652,IL-07
"Novel methods and devices to deliver substitution therapy in addiction PROJECT SUMMARY Current treatment options for addiction do not sufficiently address the clinical needs of patients. Due to low efficacy, misaligned treatment objectives, or lack of accessibility, patients are not able to durably abstain from substances or reduce their use to safer levels. Substitution therapy (ST) is a proven treatment approach and has resulted in massive global public health benefits for tobacco use disorder and opioid use disorder; however, the potential impact of ST is limited by concerns for causing more widespread harms. Thus substitution therapy is either underutilized or underexplored in other addictions due to risks of abuse, misuse, and diversion. Through implementing safe prescribing systems, health systems have solved for the provision of existing ST like methadone and buprenorphine. Nevertheless, there remains significant potential for broader access to current and novel ST treatments by utilizing advancement in software and hardware technology. Atman Therapeutics is an early-stage company seeking to develop novel therapeutics in addictive disorders. We are developing a platform to enable increased access to as well as novel development of ST. To achieve this objective, our platform uses cutting-edge machine learning methods, patient-centered research, and sophisticated hardware technology. Our technology will also enable the concurrent delivery of contingency management services, thus creating safe, engaging, and durably effective treatments for these complex neurobehavioral disorders. This Small Business Innovation and Research (SBIR) project aims to establish the feasibility of machine learning and integrated sensor technologies to confirm medication adherence in a diverse sample of patients. We will develop a deep-learning algorithm utilizing a feed-forward convolutional neural network (CNN), such as ResNet- 50, U-NET, PCU-Net, to enact classification of medication ingestion events. We will also demonstrate the feasibility of integrating a hardware microcontroller unit with multi-dimensional MEMS sensors into a device that can classify ingestion events in a highly sensitive and specific manner. These efforts will demonstrate the early feasibility of the Atman platform and form the basis for regulated development efforts of ST-enabling products and services. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our proposal aims to develop automated methods to confirm ingestion of medication, as this is a critical step to ensure medication compliance. In this proof-of-concept study, we will demonstrate the feasibility of automated ingestion confirmation and integrate hardware components capable of accurately confirming ingestion to enable a novel

"Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices Project Summary/Abstract This is a project to develop new statistical methods for comparing groups of subjects in terms of health outcomes that are assessed using data from wearable devices. Inexpensive wearable sensors for health monitoring are now capable of generating massive amounts of data collected longitudinally, up to months at a time. The project will develop inferential methods that can deal with the complexity of such data. A serious challenge is the presence of unmeasured time-dependent confounders (e.g., circadian and dietary patterns), making direct comparisons or borrowing strength across subjects untenable unless the studies are carried out in controlled experimental con- ditions. Generic data mining and machine learning tools have been widely used to provide predictions of health status from such data. However, such tools cannot be used for signiﬁcance testing of covariate effects, which is necessary for designing precision medicine interventions, for example, without taking the inherent model selection or the presence of the unmeasured confounders into account. To overcome these difﬁculties, a systematic de- velopment of inferential methods for functional outcome data obtained from wearable devices will be carried out. There are three speciﬁc aims: 1) Develop metrics for functional outcome data from wearable devices, 2) Develop nonparametric estimation and testing methods for activity proﬁles and a screening method for predictors of activity proﬁles, 3) Implement the methods in an R package and carry out two case studies using accelerometer data. For Aim 1, the approach is to reduce the sensor data to occupation time proﬁles (e.g., as a function of activity level), and formulate the statistical modeling in terms of these proﬁles using survival and functional data analytic meth- ods. This will have a number of advantages, the principal one being that time-dependent confounders become less problematic because the effect of differences in temporal alignment across subjects is mitigated. In addition, survival analysis methods can be applied by viewing the occupation time as a time-to-event outcome indexed by activity level. For Aim 2, nonparametric methods will be used to compare and order occupation time distributions between groups of subjects that are speciﬁed in terms of baseline covariate levels or treatment groups. Further, a new method of post-selection inference based on marginal screening for function-on-scalar regression will be developed to identify and formally test whether covariates are signiﬁcantly associated with activity proﬁles. Aim 3 will develop an R-package implementation, and as a test-bed for the proposed methods they will be applied to two Columbia-based clinical studies: to the study of physical activity in children enrolled in New York City Head Start, and to the study of experimental drugs for the treatment of mitochondrial depletion syndrome. Project Narrative The relevance of the project to public health is that it will develop statistical methods for the physiological eval- uation of patients on the basis of data collected by inexpensive wearable sensors (e.g., accelerometers). By introducing methods for the rigorous comparison of healthcare status among groups of patients observed longi- tudinally over time using such devices, treatment decisions that can beneﬁt targeted populations of patients in terms of continuously-assessed health outcomes will become possible.",Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices,10135813,R01AG062401,"['Acceleration ', ' Beds ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Preschool Child ', ' 1-5 years old ', ' preschool child (1-5) ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Drug Combinations ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' indexing ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Motivation ', ' New York City ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Stochastic Processes ', ' stochastic method ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Syndrome ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' Head Start ', ' Head Start Program ', ' Proxy ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Bypass ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Data ', ' dietary pattern ', ' Dietary Practices ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' time use ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' patient population ', ' Regimen ', ' screening ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' treatment group ', ' Data Analytics ', ' Accelerometer ', ' accelerometry ', ' activity monitor ', ' activity tracker ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' lower income families ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable biosensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' circadian ', ' data complexity ', ' ']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,298890,NY-13
"Improved AD/ADRD Assessment Sensitivities Using a Novel In-Situ Sensor System Project Summary/Abstract  Accurate assessment of daily functions for individuals at risk for and with AD/ADRD, is fundamental to detection, diagnosis, and characterization of its progression and prescribed treatments. Current assessment techniques typically rely on non- continuous, discreet observations provided from a third party and covering single or limited performance domains. With significantly larger portions of American’s choosing to age in place, any assessment technology must be able to be in-situ (low-cost, ubiquitous) and operate without user interface (autonomous) to provide objective, cross-domain, and continuous daily function measurements and reporting.  The primary objective of this fast track SBIR project is to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of using the Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system to continuously and accurately assess daily functions, ADLs, and IADLs, for persons experiencing cognitive decline in a home or assisted care settings. This includes direct comparison with an accepted assessment technique, ADCS-ADL/23. Machine learning and artificial intelligent techniques will be employed to identify novel subfactors for improved sensitivities from available sensor data combinations. Secondary objectives include establishing a significant data set of detailed daily actions (<10 sec resolution) for 100+ individuals with AD/ADRD. Long-term goals support future intervention studies through improved assessment tools with enhanced sensitivity to early and mid-stage decline.  The Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system makes use of patented proximity-based energy monitoring and control sensors, data analytics and change detection algorithms to continuously monitor activities of individuals in a home or assisted care environment. Intelligent power-strips and battery-based sensors located throughout the home or facility, monitor real time absolute location of individuals, caregivers, and devices they interact with. Correlation of high-fidelity data allows accurate determination of activities, attribution to a specific individual, mobility measurement, and behavior assessment across traditional and novel ADL/IADL categories. Birkeland Current is teamed with Texas A&M Center for Population Health and Aging, Georgia, Tech Institute for People and Technology, Baylor Scott and White Division of Gerontology, and multiple home-care and assisted-care facilities, in the development of the study approach, implementation plan, analytics tools, and applications to aging populations and future intervention studies. Project Narrative  The proposed research would utilize novel, ubiquitous Internet-of-Things sensors and automated analytics to demonstrate enhanced sensitivity and future utility of continuous in-situ IADL/ADL data for dementia research and its effectiveness in characterizing interventions for Alzheimer’s and related dementias of aging populations in support of NIA stated priorities.",Improved AD/ADRD Assessment Sensitivities Using a Novel In-Situ Sensor System,10144919,R44AG065118,"['Adoption ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavioral Symptoms ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' care facilities ', ' Industry ', ' Institutes ', ' Intelligence ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patents ', ' Patients ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Publishing ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Technology ', ' Technology Assessment ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Use Effectiveness ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' patient home care ', ' Home Care ', ' patient homecare ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Gerontology ', ' biogerontology ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' In Situ ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' American ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Categories ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Early identification ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' Effectiveness ', ' IADL ', ' instrumental activity of daily living ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Centers for Population Health ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Monitor ', ' Grouping ', ' groupings ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' cost ', ' data integration ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' daily functioning ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' analytical tool ', ' data acquisition ', ' aging population ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' database structure ', ' data base structure ', ' personalized care ', ' Precision care ', ' individualized care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Data Analytics ', ' Internet of Things ', ' real time monitoring ', ' realtime monitoring ', ' aging in place ', ' age in place ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' learning algorithm ', ' home test ', ' home-based test ', ' detection platform ', ' detection system ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIA,BIRKELAND CURRENT LLC,R44,2021,1807912,TX-17
"Incorporating Learning Effects into Medical Device Active Safety Surveillance Methods Implantable medical devices have revolutionized contemporary cardiovascular care, and are used in a wide spectrum of acute and chronic cardiovascular conditions. However, medical device design fault or incorrect use may lead to significant risk of patient injury and represents an important preventable public health risk in the United States. To help identify device-related safety issues, a strategy of active, prospective, post-market safety surveillance has been recommended by the FDA, and evaluated methodologically. This type of surveillance offers significant advantages over traditional adverse event reporting strategies. However, all such approaches are challenged by the need to incorporate learning effects into expectations regarding safety. These learning impacts been repeatedly shown to have dramatic impacts on outcomes during early device experience. Quantifying learning effects on the outcomes associated with high-risk cardiovascular devices will improve our understanding of intrinsic device performance, thereby identifying patient populations best treated with such devices while simultaneously providing necessary feedback to device manufacturers to support iterative improvement in device design. Separately, understanding the impacts of learning may identify opportunities for targeted training as well as help to tease apart institutional and operator characteristics that may accelerate the achievement of optimal outcomes in the use of the specific cardiovascular device.  This proposal seeks to extend the previously validated, open-source, active, prospective device safety surveillance tool, by developing and validating robust learning curve (LC) detection and quantification algorithms, designed to simultaneously account for the effects at the operator and institutional levels. We propose a “blinded” development strategy, in which one team will generate robust synthetic clinical data simulator with LC impacts, and the other team develops and applies LC detection and quantification algorithms, without knowledge of the underlying relationships, determine performance and accuracy through sequential refinement and validation steps. We propose to formally validate the optimized LC tools in real-world data through re-analysis of previously published LC effects on transcatheter valves and vascular closure devices using national cardiovascular registries. In addition, the LC tools will be incorporated into two active, prospective device safety surveillance studies of novel implantable cardiovascular devices using large clinical registries. This proposal seeks to understand the impact of institutional and physician learning on the safety of newly approved cardiovascular devices, and to use this knowledge to support and improve effective medical device safety surveillance. We propose a “blinded” strategy of separating simulated dataset generation from the learning effects detection and quantification algorithm development. Incorporating learning effects adjustment into a validated, prospective, near-real-time safety surveillance system, this research will improve public health by identifying poorer performing cardiovascular devices, and provide physicians, device manufacturers and public health officials with better information to optimize the use of medical devices, iteratively improve their design, and identify opportunities for enhanced training that will result in improved patient outcomes.",Incorporating Learning Effects into Medical Device Active Safety Surveillance Methods,10088471,R01HL149948,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Algorithms ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Data Aggregation ', ' Aggregated Data ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' implantable device ', ' biomedical implant ', ' implant device ', ' indwelling device ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Medical Device Designs ', ' Medical Device Safety ', ' Medical Device ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Registries ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Generations ', ' Device Designs ', ' Device Safety ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Blinded ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Provider ', ' Institution ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Surveillance Methods ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' systems research ', ' post-market ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Implant ', ' open source ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' surveillance strategy ', ' surveillance study ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' Algorithm Design ', ' Algorithmic Design ', ' Algorithmic Engineering ', ' algorithm engineering ', ' algorithmic composition ', ' Data Analytics ', ' Injections ', ' clinical heterogeneity ', ' algorithm development ', ' safety outcomes ', ' ']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,768996,TN-05
"Dense life-log health analytics from wearable senors using functional analysis and Riemannian geometry The growth and acceptance of wearable devices (e.g., accelerometers) and personal technologies (e.g., smartphones), coupled with larger storage capacities, waterproofing, and more unobtrusive wear locations, has made long-term monitoring of behaviors throughout the 24-hour spectrum more feasible. Wearable devices relevant for human activity (e.g., GENEActiv accelerometer) contain several complementary sensors (accelerometers, gyro, heart- rate monitor etc.) and sample at high rates (e.g., 100Hz for accelerometer). These high-sampling rates and the long duration of capture result in life-log data that truly qualifies as multimodal and big time-series data. The challenges and opportunities involved in fully harvesting these types of data, for widely applicable interventions, suggest that an interdisciplinary approach spanning mathematical sciences, signal processing, and health is needed. Our innovation includes the use of functional-data analysis tools to represent and process the dense time-series data. Functional data analysis is then integrated into machine learning and pattern discovery algorithms for activity classification, prediction of attributes, and discovery of new activity classes. We anticipate that the proposed framework will lead to new insights about human activity and its impact on health outcomes. This interdisciplinary project builds on several research activities of the team. Our past work includes: a) new mathematical developments for computing statistics on time-series data viewed as elements of a function-spaces, b) algorithms for activity recognition that integrate the function-space techniques, and c) data from long-term observational studies of human activity from multimodal sensors. The new work we propose addresses the unique mathematical and computational challenges posed by densely multimodal, long-term, densely-sampled Iifelog big-data in a comprehensive framework. The fusion of ideas from human activity modeling, functional-analysis, geometric metrics, and algorithmic machine learning, present unique opportunities for fundamental advancement of the state-of-the-art in objective measurement and quantification of behavioral markers from wearable devices. The proposed approach also brings to fore: a) new mathematical developments of elastic metrics over multi-modal time-series data, b) comparing sequences evolving on different feature manifolds, c) estimation of quasi- periodicities, d) and a new generation of machine-learning and pattern discovery algorithms. The mathematical and algorithmic tools proposed have the potential to significantly advance how wearable data from contemporary devices with high-sampling rates and large storage capabilities are represented, processed, and transformed into accurate inferences about human activity. Wearable devices are becoming more widely adopted in recent years for general health and recreational uses by the broad populace. This research will result in improved algorithms to process the data available from such wearable devices. The long-term goal of the research is to enable personalized home-based physical activity regimens for conditions such as stroke and diabetes.

"Clinical Evaluation of Burns using Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Durkin, Anthony J. Abstract The central aim of this 3 year competing R01 renewal is to characterize and apply a new, compact, clinic- friendly Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging (SFDI) device to objectively and non-invasively classify burn severity (burn grade) over a large areas of skin. Delays in determining burn severity directly impacts patient treatment plans (including decisions whether to graft), rates of infection and scarring, duration of hospitalization and ultimately cost of care. Currently, the primary method of determining burn severity continues to be clinical assessment, which is highly subjective. While both superficial thickness and full-thickness burns are typically readily diagnosed based on visual clinical impression, partial thickness burns are difficult to classify and carry with them considerable potential for complications. Burn severity classification accuracy, even by experts, is only 60–80%. Our research in animal models demonstrates that SFDI data can successfully be used to classify different regions of burn severities. Typically, these differences are not apparent to the unaided eye and a great deal of training and experience is required in order for clinicians to accurately differentiate them Our work using a research grade, hybrid-SFDI device suggests that objective parameters provided by SFDI can be used within 24 hours after injury, to accurately classify burn severity. Specifically, we have demonstrated in a porcine burn model that the research grade SFDI outperforms laser speckle imaging and thermal imaging at 24 hours post-burn, in terms of predicting whether a burn will require a graft or not. However, translating these results to the clinic has been difficult due to several device limitations. The research grade SFDI device has slow acquisition times that can result in motion artifacts. It is also sensitive to ambient light which is often an issue in a clinical setting. Additionally, the SFDI device generates so much diverse data (oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin, water fraction, reduced scattering coefficients at multiple wavelengths), there is no obvious way to present it to a clinical user to make a quick decision. To this end, we propose to methodically investigate an improved next generation SFDI device that addresses these issues by using brighter LEDs and fewer wavelengths to rapidly collect data in a way that reduces motion artifacts and is independent of clinical lighting conditions. In addition, we will develop a machine learning based classification framework that will provide the clinical with actionalble diagnostic information. The central aim of this 3 year competing R01 renewal is to characterize and then modify a new clinic-friendly SFDI device (Clarifi) to objectively classify in- vivo regions of different burn severity over large areas. The proposed research seeks to investigate this via the following Specific Aims: 1) Test & Validate Clinical SFDI Instrument, 2) Compare Clinical SFDI Instrument to other Modalities on a Long Term Swine Model of Graded Burns, 3) Develop Spatially Resolved Classification Maps of Burn Severity based on SFDI Data, 4) Conduct Clinical Measurements of Burn Severity using the new SFDI device and Spatially Resolved Burn Severity Classification Maps based on SFDI data. Program Director (Last, first, middle): Durkin, Anthony J. PROJECT NARRATIVE Burn injuries rank in the top 15 causes of global burden of disease. Burn severity assessment, which is a critical step in treatment planning, is subjective, depending on the experience of the treating physician. This leads to misdiagnosis and increased days of hospitalization and cost. In order to address this, we propose to test, validate and apply a novel optical imaging device in order to provide noninvasive objective assessment of burn wound severity.

"An Autonomous, Non-invasive, and Bioanalytics-enabled Wearable Platform for Precision Nutrition and Personalized Medicine Project Summary  This proposal aims to enable precision nutrition by creating a wearable technology that can be scaled across the general population to non-invasively track the diurnal profiles of a panel of putative circulating nutrients and biomarkers. Accordingly, we will address fundamental and intermeshed engineering bottlenecks and scientific questions at sensor, device, and data analytics levels to realize a sweat-based wearable bioanalytical technology, equipped with autonomous sweat secretion modulation, biofluid management, and analysis capabilities. To illustrate our technology’s transformative potential, we will particularly position it to monitor a panel of nutrients and indicators of the metabolic and disease state that are relevant in cystic fibrosis (CF, the most common inherited multisystemic disorder), in order to enable individualized nutritional support, which is central to the CF treatment.  Accordingly, in the first phase (R21), we will develop microsensor arrays targeting glucose, triglyceride, and β- hydroxybutyrate. We will incorporate our readily developed auxiliary sensing modalities (sweat sodium, chloride, pH, and sweat secretion rate sensing interfaces) to enable the in-situ characterization of the secretion profile (which is useful for the normalization of sweat readings and tracking of the CF progression). In parallel to these engineering efforts, we will conduct sweat characterization experiments to study the effect of the secretion rate on analyte partitioning from blood into sweat. These datasets will be augmented with state-of-art machine learning algorithms to formulate a dedicated analytical framework that accounts for sweat secretion variabilities and determines optimal sweat secretion condition(s) to provide undistorted and physiologically meaningful sweat readings.  In the second phase (R33), we will establish the clinical utility of our technology by demonstrating the ability to non-invasively track the target nutrients’ temporal profiles in relation to their circulating levels in blood (in both healthy subjects and CF patients and through simple/mixed meal-modulated studies). Accordingly, we will first measure the sweat and blood analytes’ excursion profiles after controlled single/binary combinations of nutrients intake and develop a machine-learning based algorithm to correlate the sweat analyte readouts to their circulating concentrations. Then we will assess and characterize the predictive utility of our solution in the context of complex nutritional supplement studies. Upon its validation, we will recruit a cohort of CF patients and perform a longitudinal randomized nutritional support study to demonstrate the enabling remote patient monitoring capabilities rendered by our solution.  The success of this work will represent a groundbreaking contribution towards the development of strategies to enable precision nutrition and personalized medicine. Project Narrative This proposal aims to enable precision nutrition by creating a wearable sweat bioanalytical technology— equipped with autonomous sweat secretion modulation, biofluid management, and analysis capabilities—that can be scaled across the general population to non-invasively track the diurnal profiles of a panel of putative circulating nutrients and biomarkers.

"Clinical performance of hemodynamics-based non-invasive device for skin cancer testing Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the US, accounting for just under half of all diagnosed cancers (5+ million diagnoses), 27,000+ deaths each year and the annual treatment costs of over $8.1 billion. The early diagnosis of skin cancer has significant impact on patient outcomes and health care costs but remains highly subjective and requires highly specialized training while existing diagnostic devices offer low positive predictive value which results in both, missed skin cancers as well as a large number of unnecessary biopsies. When a patient presents with a suspicious skin lesion, uncertainty in the initial assessment by a dermatologist may lead to biopsies that suggest that no subsequent treatment is necessary (false positive - FP) while at the same time lesions that are not biopsied may warrant treatment (false negative - FN) potentially giving rise to claims of malpractice. FPs subject patients to unnecessary procedures and the health care system to unnecessary costs. FNs result in delayed treatment, compromising patient outcomes and increasing health care costs. This diagnostic problem is exacerbated when a patient first presents to a primary care practice due to lesser diagnostic performance. Here, some patients may be referred unnecessarily to dermatologists while other cases go undetected. The Veriskin’s TruScore device is a proprietary, non-invasive, low-cost, easy-to-use, hand-held unit that supports the diagnosis of skin cancer. It rapidly and objectively determines whether a suspicious skin lesion is cancerous, reducing the number of FNs and also reducing the need for unnecessary biopsies. The device provides a score of 0% to 100% indicating the probability of malignancy. The TruScore works by detecting and analyzing force-induced hemodynamic abnormalities due to pathological angiogenesis which is a well established early hallmark of cancer. Pilot clinical studies indicate >99% sensitivity and >94% specificity in differentiating of skin cancer from a variety of benign conditions. The device is useful at all levels of care, but the greatest benefits to patients may result when the device is used in primary care practice. The specific goal of this project is to test the device in a larger scale clinical study. The long-term goal of the project is to achieve widespread clinical adoption of this simple-to-use and low-cost non- invasive skin cancer diagnostic method and device that will (1) facilitate sensitive, specific and non-subjective assessment of suspect skin regions by general practice clinicians and nurse practitioners, (2) enable precise targeting of patients for biopsies and/or escalation of care and (3) provide overall reduction in skin cancer treatment costs. Project Narrative The lack of accurate, objective skin cancer assessment tool for frontline caregivers leads to preventable loss of lives and costs the US healthcare system over $8B each year.  VeriSkin device enables a low cost, non-invasive, easy-to-use skin cancer diagnostic method that will (1) facilitate accurate and non-subjective assessment of suspect skin lesions by general practice clinicians, nurse practitioners and physician assistants, (2) enable precise targeting of patients for biopsies and/or escalation of care resulting in reduction in both the number of missed skin cancers and the number of unneeded referrals to dermatologists and unnecessary biopsies, and (3) provide overall reduction in skin cancer treatment costs.  The requested funds will be used to demonstrate the safety and the effectiveness of the device in a larger clinical study needed to enable regulatory approval of the device.",Clinical performance of hemodynamics-based non-invasive device for skin cancer testing,10127607,R44CA250768,"['absorption ', ' Accounting ', ' Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Biopsy ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Blood capillaries ', ' capillary ', ' Skin Cancer ', ' Malignant Skin Neoplasm ', ' malignant skin tumor ', ' Squamous cell carcinoma ', ' Epidermoid Carcinoma ', ' Planocellular Carcinoma ', ' Squamous Carcinoma ', ' Squamous Cell Epithelioma ', ' Certification ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Family Practice ', ' family medicine ', ' General Practitioners ', ' Generalists ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Internal Medicine ', ' Investments ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Malpractice ', ' melanoma ', ' Malignant Melanoma ', ' Methods ', ' Neoplasms ', ' neoplasia ', ' neoplastic growth ', ' Pathologic Neovascularization ', ' Pathologic Angiogenesis ', ' Pathological Angiogenesis ', ' Pathological Neovascularization ', ' Nevus ', ' Melanotic Nevus ', ' skin mole ', ' Nurse Practitioners ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Patients ', ' Physician Assistants ', "" Doctor's Assistants "", "" Physicians' Extenders "", ' Pigments ', ' pressure ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Privatization ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Savings ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' skin lesion ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vascular resistance ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' General Practices ', ' Specialist ', ' Treatment Cost ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Caring ', ' Intercellular Fluid ', ' Interstitial Fluids ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Malignant ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Cutaneous ', ' Blood flow ', ' Painless ', ' non-painful ', ' nonpainful ', ' not painful ', ' Measurement ', ' Device Approval ', ' Device Approval Process ', ' Funding ', ' Dermatologist ', ' Screening for Skin Cancer ', ' skin cancer early detection ', ' Morphology ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Unnecessary Procedures ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Frequencies ', ' Tumor Tissue ', ' Using hands ', ' Hand functions ', ' Basal Cell ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' mechanical pressure ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' peace ', ' Devices ', ' response ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Skin ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Detection ', ' Cancer Diagnostics ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Non-Invasive Cancer Detection ', ' Non-Invasive Detection ', ' Noninvasive Cancer Detection ', ' Noninvasive Detection ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Pathologic ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Mind ', ' Coupled ', ' Cancerous ', ' commercialization ', ' tumor ', ' clinical practice ', ' safety testing ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' IRB ', ' IRBs ', ' screening ', ' Algorithmic Analysis ', ' Algorithmic Analyses ', ' Analyses of Algorithms ', ' Analysis of Algorithms ', ' vascular abnormality ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' provider behavior ', ' clinician behavior ', ' physician behavior ', ' ']",NCI,"VERISKIN, INC.",R44,2021,833460,CA-52
"Creating adaptive, wearable technologies to assess and intervene for individuals with ADRDs PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Advances in machine learning and low-cost, wearable sensors offer a practical method for understanding, assessing, and intervening for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRDs) in everyday spaces. We propose to create a Behaviorome research program that will create ground-breaking methods for building health-predictive models from wearable sensor data by mapping patterns of behavior using machine learning and pervasive computing technologies. This program will create innovative multidisciplinary ideas to address NIH ADRD Milestone 11.c, Embed wearable technologies/pervasive computing in existing and new clinical research. Our research program builds on a history of interdisciplinary research contributions in areas including human behavior modeling from longitudinal sensor data and design of novel assessment and intervention mechanisms. We propose to design and validate methods for mapping a human behaviorome “in the wild”, automatically assessing cognitive and functional health from behavior markers, scaling technologies through machine learning, linking health and behavior with their influences, and closing the loop with automated interventions. Similarly, our mentoring program builds on experience training students and early- career investigators to become leaders in the field of gerontechnology. We will recruit and train graduate students and early-stage researchers, including those from underrepresented groups, to grow an institutional multidisciplinary Behaviorome research program and to establish new research programs that contribute to the targeted Milestone. We will scale the impact of mentoring by establishing a webinar series and creating youtube videos that highlight and explain breakthroughs in the design and application of Behaviorome research. Results of this program will include scripts and templates to construct a behaviorome with resource- limited wearable devices, scale data and models to large diverse populations, integrate data with multiple information sources (e.g., genetics), automate health assessment and intervention, and create understandable explanations of data and models. These will contribute to existing clinical studies such as the clinician-in-the- loop smart home, digital memory notebook, and pervasive computing measures of functional performance. Furthermore, they will lead to new clinical studies that formalize connections between health and its influences, exploration of the impact of ethnicity and the built environment on health, and the design of ADRD interventions for medication adherence, task prompting, and negative interaction de-escalation. The proposed contributions are significant because they will provide insights on detecting and assessing ADRDs within a person's everyday environment using wearable sensing and pervasive computing methods that have not been investigated in prior work. Additionally, the mentoring steps will pave the way for a new generation of researchers to offer improved methods of addressing the need to understand, assess, and intervene for ADRDs in everyday settings, thereby improving quality of life and reducing health care costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to build a multidisciplinary research and mentoring program that will design wearable sensing and pervasive computing technologies to improve detection, assessment and intervention for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs). Built on a foundation of existing research and mentoring collaboration between computer science and neuropsychology, we will design and validate methods to analyze the relationship between ADRDs and behavior. We will create robust health-predictive models from longitudinal sensor data collected in naturalistic settings and will connect health and behavior with multiple influences, such as genetics and environment, to advance quality of care and reduce functional disability associated with ADRDs.","Creating adaptive, wearable technologies to assess and intervene for individuals with ADRDs",10168052,R35AG071451,"['Behavior ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Memory ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Technology ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' career ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' computer science ', ' novel ', ' graduate student ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Cognitive ', ' medication compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' built environment ', ' student training ', ' webinar ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' under representation of groups ', ' under represented groups ', ' under represented populations ', ' underrepresentation of groups ', ' recruit ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable biosensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' health assessment ', ' smart home ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' ']",NIA,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,918000,WA-05
"Towards a Convenient, Point-of-Care Device for Screening and Surveillance of Aortic Aneurysms PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT An aortic aneurysm carries increasing risk of rupture with growing aneurysm diameter. This condition is typically asymptomatic, so screening and surveillance are essential. Ultrasound and other imaging methods are employed for such monitoring at high accuracy. However, these methods require an expert-operator and are expensive, and aortic aneurysms are considerably underdetected at present and may become even more underdetected in the future as the disease prevalence increases with societal aging. The broad goal is to establish a point-of-care device that is convenient in use and cost (e.g., in a smartphone form factor) for aortic aneurysm screening and surveillance. The underlying hypothesis is that arterial waveforms, which can be obtained with such a device, constitute a non- imaging solution for indicating aneurysm size. This new hypothesis will be efficiently and effectively tested by leveraging a wealth of existing patient data. These data include high-fidelity, non-invasive waveforms from four arterial sites and reference imaging measurements of aneurysm size from at least 217 patients and 217 matchable controls. The specific aims are to develop and validate (1) physics-based methods and (2) machine learning methods for predicting aneurysm size from arterial waveforms. The physics-based methods will fit tube-load models of arterial wave transmission and reflection to the waveforms to estimate parameters indicative of aneurysm size. The machine learning methods will employ linear regression or a neural network and take inputs comprising waveform features such as pulse wave velocity, which decreases with increasing aneurysm diameter as predicted by the well-known Moens-Korteweg equation, and number of local waveform maxima, which may increase with enhanced negative wave reflection induced by aneurysm growth, as well as confounding factors such as blood pressure and age, which also alter pulse wave velocity, to predict aneurysm diameter. These methods will be optimized using a portion of the patient data for application to various combinations of the arterial waveforms (e.g., proximal and distal waveforms or single waveforms). The developed methods will then be tested using the remaining data, while blinded to the reference aneurysm measurements, in terms of their ability to track aneurysm diameter and classify patients versus controls and patients before versus after endovascular repair. The final method will be chosen as the one that best balances accuracy of aneurysm monitoring with convenience of arterial waveform measurements. Successful completion of this project will guide the design and justify the development of a point-of-care device that may ultimately help mitigate aortic aneurysm mortality. PROJECT NARRATIVE An aortic aneurysm – a balloon-like bulge in the body’s main blood vessel – is at risk for rupture, which often leads to death. However, taking a picture of inside the body to make a diagnosis requires an expert-operator and is expensive, and the condition is often left undetected.

"Implantable Neurostimulators for Control of Oscillatory Brain Networks We propose to develop an implantable brain stimulation system to measure and control oscillatory local field potential (LFP) synchrony within brain networks. Implantable neurotechnologies like deep brain stimulation (DBS) have revolutionized the treatment of movement disorders and epilepsy. DBS has some clinical signal in psychiatry as well, but individual trial results are highly variable. We have argued that this is a target engagement problem – that the high-frequency constant stimulation used in Parkinson’s or other tremor disorders is not the right approach to the circuits of mental illness. Instead, we believe the correct approach is to identify signatures of healthy communication in these circuits/networks, then design stimulation protocols that specifically produce those signatures. LFP synchrony is likely one of those communication signatures. Across multiple domains of cognitive and emotional function, behavioral performance (a read-out of successful network communication) improves when brain regions show synchronous (coherent) LFP oscillations. Further, clinically effective DBS, in movement and psychiatric disorders, is associated with changes in LFP synchrony. Co-PI Widge has developed algorithms that specifically control inter-regional LFP synchrony, by locking electrical stimulation pulses in one region to the phase of an ongoing oscillation in another region. The translational challenge is that efficient, implantable real-time synchrony monitoring and phase-locked stimulation require signal processing capabilities not found in any existing or anticipated device. Co-PI Shoaran has developed power-efficient phase estimation circuits, specifically optimized for DBS- like implants. We propose to combine these approaches. Aims 1 and 2 will develop a new application- specific integrated circuit (ASIC) that integrates Dr. Shoaran’s measurement and neural decoding frameworks with Dr. Widge’s oscillation-control methods. We will validate this circuit’s recording and phase-locking capabilities in vivo in Dr. Widge’s rodent lab. In Aim 3, a world-leading contract implant manufacturer (Cirtec) will integrate that new ASIC into a packaged, implant-ready device ready for large animal safety testing. Cirtec has already developed a DBS prototyping platform optimized to get new therapies more quickly into first-in- human, allowing us to greatly accelerate the path to the clinic and reduce regulatory risk. At the end of 5 years, we will either be ready for that clinical pilot or have only modest safety testing remaining. Our team has expertise in electronics, medical device fabrication, clinical brain stimulation, and technology commercialization. The work will be headquartered in Minnesota’s “Medical Alley”, an epicenter of medical device innovation. We are well-qualified to execute these Aims and bring the resulting technology to market. Success would yield a new implant optimized for network monitoring and therapy, a powerful new tool for both psychiatric treatment and cutting-edge neuroscience research. Project Narrative We will develop a new implantable medical device for treating severe psychiatric illness, especially mood and anxiety disorders. Many, if not all, of these disorders arise from communication failure in distributed brain networks, networks that communicate through rhythmic, oscillatory firing of large groups of brain cells. Our device will implement new algorithms that measure and control that rhythmic firing, restoring patterns of healthy communication.",Implantable Neurostimulators for Control of Oscillatory Brain Networks,10227769,R01MH123634,"['Algorithms ', ' Laboratory Animals ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Budgets ', ' Communication ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electric Stimulation ', ' Electrical Stimulation ', ' electrostimulation ', ' Electronics ', ' electronic device ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Equipment ', ' Future ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Medical Device Designs ', ' Medical Device ', ' Methods ', ' Minnesota ', ' Modernization ', ' Movement Disorders ', ' Dyskinesia Syndromes ', ' Movement Disorder Syndromes ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Patients ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Physiology ', ' Play ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Rattus ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rat ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Risk ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Seizures ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Tremor ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Psychiatric therapeutic procedure ', ' psychiatric care ', ' psychiatric therapy ', ' psychiatric treatment ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' analog ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Manufactured form ', ' programs ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' cognitive function ', ' Deep Brain Stimulation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' brain cell ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' Devices ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Brain region ', ' Symptoms ', ' Animal Testing ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Therapeutic Effect ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' conditioning ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' nanofabrication ', ' nano fabricate ', ' nano fabrication ', ' nanofabricate ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' Coupling ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Implant ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' neurotechnology ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' industry partner ', ' industrial partnership ', ' industry partnership ', ' safety testing ', ' translational neuroscience ', ' signal processing ', ' trigonometry ', ' trigonometric ', ' brain dysfunction ', ' dysfunctional brain ', ' psychiatric symptom ', ' first-in-human ', ' first in man ', ' animal safety ', ' emotional functioning ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2021,871272,MN-05
"Digital Biomarkers of Ulcerative Colitis Flare This project will evaluate longitudinally collected physiological metrics, with a focus on autonomic nervous system function (heart rate variability [HRV]), using wearable devices. It will investigate the ability of these physiological metrics to identify and predict symptomatic ulcerative colitis (UC) flares. It will explore the modifiability of these metrics through a HRV directed biofeedback intervention and its impact on UC symptoms. Candidate: The primary objective of this application is to support the development of Dr. Robert Hirten into an independent patient-oriented researcher in the field of digital health and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) research. Dr. Hirten’s career goal is to be an independent researcher and leader in leveraging the dense physiological data acquired through novel wearable technologies in IBD research. Dr. Hirten’s proposed training activities are in five areas: (1) Advanced statistical methodology, (2) Digital health, (3) Clinical trial design, (4) Behavioral intervention science, (5) Career development. To achieve these goals Dr. Hirten has assembled a mentorship team led by Dr. Bruce Sands, Chief of Gastroenterology at The Mount Sinai Hospital who has expertise in longitudinal and clinical trial research in IBD. Environment: The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai has a strong tradition of research and is a top 20 medical school in NIH funding. The Mount Sinai Division of Gastroenterology is a top 10 division in the country by US News and World Report and is a leader in IBD research and clinical care. The Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai is an international institute with expertise in data science, biomedical and digital engineering. Research: UC is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the colon with symptomatic flares characterized by diarrhea, blood per rectum and abdominal pain. Flares are frequent, occurring in at least 30% of patients per year, and are associated with morbidity and impaired quality of life. Current methods to identify and predict flare are suboptimal and limited. If flares can be identified earlier and predicted strategies for mitigation or prevent could be instituted. Advances in digital and wearable technology allow for collection of continuous, non-invasive physiological parameters potentially linked with disease activity. Therefore, our specific aims are to (1) To determine the association of physiological metrics, including HRV, with symptomatic flare in UC, (2) To assess the predictive ability of physiological metrics, with a focus on HRV, for the development of symptomatic flare in UC, (3) Determine the feasibility, acceptability, and effect size of a HRV biofeedback intervention in subjects with symptomatic UC. To accomplish this we will perform a longitudinal cohort study enrolling 160 subjects with UC in remission and follow them for 12 months or until flare, collecting physiological indices from a wearable device (Apple Watch) and survey metrics from a smart phone application. In addition, we will perform a HRV directed biofeedback intervention in 23 subjects with UC and symptomatic flare. The general approach and skills acquired during this award can be applied to future R01 grants aimed at building upon the findings from this work. There are not effective strategies to identify or predict flares of ulcerative colitis (UC), which are common and result in morbidity. We aim to identify and modify readily obtainable physiological metrics, focusing on autonomic nervous system function, to recognize flares early, predict their development and improve symptomatology.

"Portable GC detector for breath-based COVID diagnostics Project Summary/Abstract: This proposal has two major goals: 1) Define signature exhaled breath volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infections, and 2) Develop a portable chemical sensing device that can capture and detect exhaled VOCs and includes machine learning algorithms for automated data processing and results interpretation. This project will bring a portable sensor forward into clinical use with the aim of supplementing COVID-19 diagnostics with a reagentless alternative. Breath testing of exhaled VOC biomarkers is a relatively new concept that has the potential to transform healthcare in the US and globally. Our overarching hypothesis is that a miniature breath analysis device can measure signatures of exhaled breath VOCs in real-time and correlate their profile to viral upper respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV-2, even asymptomatically. In Aim #1, we propose a prospective, observational study to analyze breath samples from COVID-19 positive and negative subjects, solely for the purpose of analysis through gold standard GC- MS to define breath VOC biomarkers of infection. We will recruit subjects at two local sites, the UC Davis Medical Center (Sacramento, CA) and VA Northern California Health Care System (Mather, CA), where MPI Dr. Kenyon and Co-Is Drs. Harper and Schivo have joint clinical appointments. Our group has a proven track record to conduct these types of clinical breath studies. In Aim #2, we will develop a portable breath analysis device using our novel miniature differential mobility spectrometry (DMS) detector, coupled with chip-based gas chromatography. DMS is a subset of ion mobility spectrometry and detects VOCs at ambient temperatures and pressures, making it highly appropriate for portable devices. This device would include our custom chip- based preconcentrator, which is packed with a chemical sorbent for extraction of VOCs from breath, and will compare functionality of a compact commercially available GC column to a micro-GC column chip from Deviant, a subcontractor in this work. Individual components of this device have already been developed, and under direction of MPI Prof. Davis, Chair of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, a team of research engineers would integrate these pieces together into a single unit. Collaborator Prof. Chuah would guide development of a custom software package for the device with machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities for automated data processing and interpretation. The device would be placed in the hands of clinicians, who would provide feedback that engineers would immediately incorporate into the device and return to the clinicians for more testing. Under Aim #3, our team would process the GC-MS and GC-DMS data generated in this work, identifying a novel VOC profile for COVID-19 diagnostics. Aim #4 would initiate towards the end of this study to develop both a regulatory pathway & contract manufacturing plan for large scale production and deployment of the device for clinical approval. These efforts are supported by collaborator Dr. Nam Tran, Director of Clinical Pathology & Clinical Chemistry at the UC Davis Medical Center. Project Narrative: In the United States and worldwide, public health experts agree that nations must increase their capacity to test for COVID-19, yet global supplies for testing materials remain scarce. This project would lead to the development of an entirely new type of COVID-19 test, one that could diagnose infections with only a breath sample. Through this proposal, our team would develop a portable device that could identify people with COVID-19 infections by analyzing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) found in exhaled breath.",Portable GC

"Device to control circadian-effective light in Alzheimer's disease environments Project Summary This proposed project will develop and field-test a device that accurately monitors and controls the circadian stimulus (CS) for Alzheimer disease (AD) and Alzheimer-disease-related dementia (ADRD) patients in nursing homes. Human biology has evolved to have two distinct optical systems: the visual system, by which we see and process images, and the circadian system, which regulates our biological clock and associated biological systems. These two systems have significantly different spectral and temporal responses to optical input. Specifically, circadian stimulation peaks at 460 nm and responds after several minutes of optical activation, while the visual system peaks at 555 nm and responds nearly instantaneously to inputs. All lighting systems are designed and installed in buildings with consideration only given to the photopic (visual) system and all light meters used to characterize lighting buildings are calibrated to measure photopic light, not CS. While a broad and growing body of research has documented the impacts of the circadian system on human health, including regulating sleep and improving cognition in AD/ADRD patients, research on the CS experienced by AD/ADRD patients is extremely limited. Researchers at the Lighting Research Center at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute developed the Daysimeter, a calibrated light meter that measures circadian light and circadian stimulus. In Phase I of this project, researchers modified an existing workstation-based lighting control system they previously developed for the visual system to include Daysimeter technology, allowing this control system to record CS measurements. The accuracy of these CS measurements was confirmed in the laboratory and field-testing of 20 of devices is currently ongoing in AD/ADRD nursing homes. In this Phase II application, researchers propose adding control features to this device so that lighting can be controlled to optimize CS dosages in AD/ADRD patient environments. Machine learning-based lighting control algorithms will be driven by continuous light level and spectrum measurements as well as periodic (e.g., daily) patient health data. Data from these devices would be wirelessly transmitted to researchers via an Internet gateway and associated cloud-based data management systems. These data would be of immediate value for gaining a better understanding of AD/ADRD patients' CS exposure and could ultimately result in new lighting systems and/or building codes that consider both our visual and circadian systems. Following the development phase, 30 CS-enabled lighting control systems will be field tested over a 22-week test period. Researchers aim to commercialize this CS-enabled lighting control system shortly after the completion of this field test and the Phase II project specifically targeting AD/ADRD nursing home applications. Project Narrative A growing body of research has demonstrated how light impacts human circadian systems and how these impacts can affect sleep, alertness, cognition and agitation in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's-disease-related dementia (ADRD). Still, significant knowledge gaps exist in determining how much circadian stimulation is typically provided to AD/ADRD patients and there are no commercial products designed to control lighting in AD/ADRD environments in ways that promote circadian-related health. This project aims to fill in these gaps by developing and testing a device specifically designed to measure and control the circadian stimulation experienced by AD/ADRD patients in nursing homes.",Device to control circadian-effective light in Alzheimer's disease environments,10312690,R44AG060857,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Clocks ', ' Biologic Clock ', ' body clock ', ' internal clock ', ' Building Codes ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' Database Management Systems ', ' Data Base Management ', ' Data Base Management Systems ', ' database management ', ' database systems ', ' relational database management systems ', ' Environment ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Lighting ', ' Illumination ', ' Moods ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Patients ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Phototherapy ', ' Actinotherapy ', ' Light Therapy ', ' Photoradiation Therapy ', ' light treatment ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Retina ', ' Rotation ', ' Running ', ' Sleep ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Wakefulness ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Agitation ', ' Psychomotor Agitation ', ' Psychomotor Excitement ', ' Psychomotor Hyperactivity ', ' Psychomotor Restlessness ', ' Restlessness ', ' falls ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Stimulus ', ' awake ', ' Visual ', ' residence ', ' residential building ', ' residential site ', ' Measurement ', ' Planet Earth ', ' Earth ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hour ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' meter ', ' interest ', ' Visual System ', ' Visual system structure ', ' experience ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Human Biology ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' alertness ', ' Dose ', ' Feeds ', ' Data ', ' device development ', ' instrument development ', ' Device or Instrument Development ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' wireless ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' active control ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Population ', ' circadian pacemaker ', ' circadian clock ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' biological systems ', ' cloud based ', ' health data ', ' circadian ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' appropriate dose ', ' optimal drug dosage ', ' optimal drug dose ', ' effectiveness testing ', ' ']",NIA,"ERIK PAGE AND ASSOCIATES, INC.",R44,2021,10487,CA-02
"An Interoperable HL7 FHIR-based Medical Device Data System (MDDS) For Accessing And Integrating Live Point-Of-Care Data From High-Acuity Bedside Patient Monitoring Equipment Abstract The overall goal of this proposal is to combine expertise and approaches from biomedical engineering and critical care medicine to design a universal system to acquire, record and transmit physiological signals from bedside monitored patients. Patient monitors generate over a million datapoints of information per hour, however, only a tiny fraction of those data are transmitted or recorded. In order to improve data exchange in healthcare, the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard was published in 2014. However, it has yet to make a significant impact on Medical Device Integration (MDI), which is the process of automating the flow of clinical data from bedside medical devices, such as patient monitors, to external systems such as Electronic Medical Records (EMR). Also, MDI is a complex task because data from these devices are high-frequency and high- volume and because most devices use proprietary protocols and outdated interfaces such as serial cables. Hospitals and researchers have therefore been left with few options except to use expensive and vendor-specific MDI solutions to access these data or to use manual data entry into the patient EMR, which leads to data entry errors, late entry of data, and lost time for clinical care. Manual data entry only captures a tiny fraction of the available data, and with increased research interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning, there is a growing need for a standardized way to access the vast amounts of data from bedside devices. This project will develop a vendor-neutral software-based Medical Device Data System (MDDS) that acquires and records data from bedside devices across a hospital network and makes live data available to 3rd party systems using a FHIR application programming interface (API). The proposed proof-of-concept will consist of three elements: [i] a transmitter which encrypts and transmits patient signals across the network, [ii] an aggregator which receives, translates and records the signals to a central location, and [iii] a FHIR Server with API for allowing external systems to access live data as FHIR resources. This proposal seeks to create a novel design that will overcome a critical barrier in healthcare, medicine and research. The proposed MDDS will be valuable to hospitals, clinicians, researchers and app developers because it makes data accessible which were previously only available to clinicians at the bedside in real-time. Narrative MediCollector’s proposed vendor-neutral medical device data system (MDDS) will be a valuable research tool to access, acquire and record high-frequency bedside patient monitor data for facilitating clinical research in hospitals. In addition, it will make live patient monitor data accessible to external systems through an HL7 FHIR application programming interface (API), thereby improving interoperability in hospitals and opening the doors to the integration of live data into external systems, such as smartphone apps and artificial intelligence algorithms, which can improve clinical workflow and healthcare in general.",An Interoperable HL7 FHIR-based Medical Device Data System (MDDS) For Accessing And Integrating Live Point-Of-Care Data From High-Acuity Bedside Patient Monitoring Equipment,10353084,R43EB030890,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bio-engineered ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bioengineering ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Critical Care ', ' Elements ', ' Equipment ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Device ', ' Medicine ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Publishing ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Standardization ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Vendor ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' interest ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Process ', ' point of care ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' interoperability ', ' encryption ', ' clinical care ', ' data exchange ', ' data transfer ', ' data transmission ', ' application programming interface ', ' application program interface ', ' data access ', ' smartphone Application ', ' Android App ', ' Android Application ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smartphone App ', ' iOS app ', ' iOS application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iPhone Application ', ' Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources ', ' FHIR ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' ']",NIBIB,"MEDICOLLECTOR, LLC",R43,2021,40963,MA-05

"Periodontal Ultrasound/Photoacoustic Imaging (PUPI) PROJECT SUMMARY The objective of this proposal is to design and validate a Periodontal Ultrasound/Photoacoustic Imaging (PUPI) device which can non-invasively measure periodontal pocket depth, clinical attachment loss based on cementoenamel junction (CEJ) location, gingival biotype and inflammation. Current periodontal evaluation methods are inaccurate because they are based on visual inspection and periodontal probing. While radiography offers detailed information about hard tissues such as bone and teeth, more detailed information about soft tissue is usually missed in radiography. Ultrasound/photoacoustic approach has been used in soft tissue imaging but rarely in dentistry because they have a large size transducer which limits the entire oral cavity scan. This is a fundamental limitation of existing technology. To solve this problem, StyloSonic LLC will construct and validate a miniaturized handpiece with a compact laser diode for ultrasound/photoacoustic imaging to provide key periodontal metrics. PUPI offers real-time, accurate, and repeatable measurements with utility in diagnosis and therapy monitoring. That is the value of this proposal. The workflow will include two parts: Aim 1 will design and fabricate the PUPI prototype and Aim 2 will evaluate the fundamental functionality of the device and confirm the validation in a pilot clinical study in collaboration with Dr. Casey Chen at University of Southern California. 100 teeth (5-10 patients) with moderate periodontitis (pocket depth: 4-6 mm) will be evaluated with PUPI and manual probing method before and 4-week after the nonsurgical treatment (i.e., scaling and root planning). That will give us 80% statistical power assuming an alpha of 0.05 based on our preliminary data. Our goal is to build a handpiece that can easily scan the entire oral cavity. We will test the designed miniaturized handpiece using an oral care manikin. We hypothesize that the correlation coefficient between probing and PUPI is R2 > 0.8. We also hypothesize that the PUPI will show a significant difference in pocket depth, clinical attachment loss, gingival biotype and inflammation before and four weeks after treatment (p <0.05). This approach is innovative because for the first time, the miniaturized handpiece of PUPI will provide anatomical and functional information of the entire gingiva architecture. In addition, PUPI will enable accurate diagnostics and therapy monitoring which add enormous value for recommended treatment and ensure best outcomes. The clinical impact is the proposed device will assist dentists and periodontists to accurately diagnose gingivitis in the early stage and reduce the rate of advanced periodontitis. This work will introduce a non-invasive and non- ionizing dual modality imaging technique which has significant impacts on oral health care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Dental health is critical to quality of life, but the tools that dentists use for periodontal exams are largely anatomical and inspect the gingiva by eye or periodontal charting. This work will develop and validate a non- invasive Periodontal Ultrasound/Photoacoustic Imaging (PUPI) with a miniaturized handpiece.

"Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis One out of every two of the 2.3 million persons with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) report a fall in any given three- month period. The onset of MS is often during early or middle adulthood, making MS-induced falls a significant, long-term problem in need of new preventative interventions. Here we propose to advance several components of Just-In-Time Fall Prevention – a novel mHealth (mobile health) approach for preventing falls and to demonstrate each component in a sample of PwMS. The proposed mHealth system will be composed of wireless, wearable sensors and a mobile phone application. The wearable sensors will capture patient biomechanics and a network of statistical models, created using machine learning and deployed on the mobile phone, will predict fall risk based upon these measurements. Fall risk predictions will inform personalized interventions, delivered through the mobile application, that leverage strategies from social psychology designed to induce biomechanical and behavioral changes to immediately reduce fall risk. This approach enables real- time assessment and intervention to prevent future falls. Data to develop and pilot each component of this mHealth system will be collected in a study of N=50 PwMS that will a) capture concurrent measurements from wearable sensors, optical motion capture, force platforms, and an instrumented treadmill during functional assessments and simulated daily activities, b) track falls and objective biomechanical and behavioral measures during a 3-month in-home study, and c) assess the efficacy of point-of-choice prompts for altering fall-related biomechanics during balance-challenging daily activities. These data will be used to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Validate wearable sensor algorithms for capturing biomechanics and behavior of PwMS, 2) Identify digital biomarkers for quantifying fall risk in real time during daily life in PwMS, and 3) Pilot point-of- choice prompts for inducing biomechanical changes in PwMS under realistic cognitive load. These aims are the first step toward our goal of developing a paradigm-shifting mHealth system for fall prevention and lead naturally to future R01 support for a randomized, controlled clinical trial testing the efficacy of this approach. This project will advance several components of a novel mobile health intervention for preventing falls. If successful, this approach has the potential to shift fall preventions efforts from reactive and physician centered to preventative and patient centered improving long-term health outcomes and quality of life for those with balance and mobility impairment.",Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis,10251154,R21EB027852,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Exercise ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Heart ', ' Judgment ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Motion ', ' Multiple Sclerosis ', ' Disseminated Sclerosis ', ' insular sclerosis ', ' Persons ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Social Psychology ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Science ', ' Self-Help Devices ', ' Assistive Technology ', ' assisted device ', ' assistive device ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' falls ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' medical costs ', ' Fall prevention ', ' preventing falls ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Measurement ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' novel ', ' Study Subject ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' fall risk ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' intervention for prevention ', ' prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' preventive intervention ', ' Cognitive ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' wireless ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Impairment ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' medical attention ', ' standard measure ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' efficacy testing ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile device application ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' cognitive load ', ' cognitive burden ', ' treadmill ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable biosensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R21,2021,190266,VT-00
"Novel Approaches to Advance Coordinated Registry Networks (CRNs). Project Summary The technological transformation of US health care with the explosion of new devices and iterative changes mandates the acquisition of real-world evidence (RWE) to study devices and technologies pragmatically. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has spearheaded the RWE framework development in the pursuit of sufficient evidence that is required for regulatory decision-making such as device approvals and surveillance. With regulatory support since the launch of the National Medical Device Registry Task Force in 2015, the Medical Device Epidemiology Network (MDEpiNet) created 15 national and international coordinated registry networks (CRNs), which develop or link well-curated national RWE sources such as registries, administrative, and electronic health records (EHRs) data. The MDEpiNet is a key partner of the National Evaluation System of Technologies (NEST) coordinating center and is an international public-private partnership focusing on building global infrastructure and methodologies to advance the use of RWE for medical device evaluation. CRNs not only focus on prevention of harms but also the promotion of safer device innovation through the development of study designs that expedites patient recruitment at lower costs than traditional clinical research. MDEpiNet developed a maturity model for CRNs with various levels of achievements in seven key domains: 1) device identification, 2) quality improvement, 3) total product life-cycle, 4) data quality, 5) efficiency, 6) governance and sustainability, 7) patient engagement. This proposal focuses on the creation of innovative tools and methods necessary to achieve maturation of the networks through efficient curation of robust RWE. We will capitalize on established partnerships with registries, professional societies, integrated health systems, and many academic institutions to advance this critical national infrastructure as a foundational component of NEST. We will facilitate advancements of RWE through stakeholder roundtables, patient-facing mobile app development, and continued innovative methods development to link registries with Medicare, commercial, statewide, and EHR data to enable better research and surveillance for devices. Our specific aims facilitate stakeholder engagement for device-specific core minimum data development in women's health, prostate cancer, orthopedics, vascular disease, robot-assisted surgery, and temporomandibular joints. We will also advance and enrich linked data capacities in vascular disease, hernia repair, breast implant, prostate cancer, Women's Health, and gastrointestinal cancer CRNs. Finally, we conduct advanced analytics to determine gender disparities in device outcomes and use machine learning and active surveillance methods in hernia repair, orthopedics, stroke treatment, vascular disease, and Women's health CRNs. The CRN community of practice will enable centralized knowledge sharing to support cross-specialty and technology learning and applications. Through this, we advance the CRNs using innovative, scalable, and dynamic approaches and help them become foundational components of NEST. Narrative Medical Device Epidemiology Network will advance the research and surveillance capabilities of coordinated registry networks through stakeholder roundtables, patient-facing mobile app development, and linkages of real-world data sources.

This includes an extremely high quality BTE system we designed; an ITE system adapted by us, as well as an appropriate interface circuitry for typical wearables (e.g; headsets via the line input). Finally, a smart phone app features interfaces both for the researcher and the subject. The system runs the Master Hearing aid sweet developed concurrently in R01DC015429 (PIs Hohmann and Pavlovic). In this CRP renewal we will achieve the following goals: 1. Implement various Design for Excellence Measures (DFX) and super modern manufacturing  technology to obtain the highest product quality at the lowest product cost. This would make  the product affordable for large clinical studies and, potentially, for some consumer sales. 2. In response to the recent availability of, and the recent research demand for, a far greater  processing power to enable the development of algorithms which rely on machine learning,  we plan to increase the processing power of the device by at least 10 times, and likely 20  times, by changing the processor core to a multicore system. 3. Introduce modern low-latency BLE technology to enable efﬁcient noise reduction by utilizing  remote microphones and machine learning. 4. The other complementary requirement to extract speech from noise is being able to inform  the system whom the listener is actually listening to. This will be achieved by providing on  the PHL the interface means for external multi-sensor arrays such as EEG, OEG, etc. 5. Execute electrical and mechanical design changes dramatically reducing the size and  weight of the device. This would not only be a much more acceptable device for long clinical  trials, but would also open up a direct-to-consumer, secondary market for the device. 6. It is our strong determination to provide continuous support to the Beta sites for extensive  further testing of the device in a variety of settings. We consider this the best means to  reach the perfection. Portable Hearing Laboratory (PHL), developed in R44DC016247 has been deployed successfully at various research centers and it features a central unit connected to a number of realistic interfaces such as BTEs, ITEs, or typical wearables. In this CRP renewal we upgrade the technology to support demanding machine learning algorithms interfaced almost inconspicuously to a number of EEG and EOG electrodes to extract perfectly speech from noise. Simultaneously, we apply modern manufacturing technology to produce small, powerful and low cost devices.",Portable Hearing Laboratory  - CRP,10138807,R44DC016247,"['novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' response ', ' portability ', ' Institution ', ' Data ', ' device development ', ' instrument development ', ' Device or Instrument Development ', ' Request for Applications ', ' NIH RFA ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Validation ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' wireless ', ' Process ', ' Source Code ', ' National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders ', ' NIDCD ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' manufacturing process ', ' Linux ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' open source ', ' parent project ', ' signal processing ', ' smartphone Application ', ' Android App ', ' Android Application ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smartphone App ', ' iOS app ', ' iOS application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iPhone Application ', ' microphone ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' speech in noise ', ' hearing in noise ', ' speech in background noise ', ' speech in speech recognition ', ' speech recognition in noise ', ' algorithm development ', ' Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Algorithms ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Ear ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Environment ', ' Esthetics ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Hearing ', ' Hearing Aids ', ' assistive hearing device ', ' assistive listening device ', ' hearing amplification ', ' hearing assistance ', ' hearing assistive device ', ' hearing device ', ' Laboratories ', ' Libraries ', ' Modernization ', ' Noise ', ' Parents ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Running ', ' Sales ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' sound ', ' Speech ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transducers ', ' Universities ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' System ', ' meter ', ' simulation ', ' ']",NIDCD,"BATANDCAT, INC.",R44,2021,837653,CA-18
"Wearable Multi-modality Cuffless Blood Pressure Monitoring Abstract Continuous blood pressure (BP) is one of the most critical monitoring parameters during anesthesia, surgery and in intensive care units (ICU). Both hypotension and hypertension can impair the function of vital organs (e.g. brain, heart and kidneys), and intraoperative hypotension is associated with postoperative mortality, which makes it important to detect BP changes as quickly as possible to prompt timely intervention or therapy. However, the current gold standard technology for BP monitoring, an invasive arterial line (a-line), causes patient suffering (physical pain) and increases the risk of infection. In the United States, about 80,000 blood stream infections caused by an arterial catheter are reported annually. Due to the inherent risks associated with a-line, it is used only for clinically indicated high risk surgeries or ICU patients. As a result of the a-line risks and discomforts, even though more than 300 million surgeries are performed worldwide each year, only a small portion receive continuous BP monitoring. In addition, although vital sign (ECG, pulse oximetry, BP etc) monitoring is routine in surgical rooms and ICUs, currently most monitoring devices are fixed in individual rooms, which result in gaps in patient monitoring, accidents during patient transport process, and extra work to disconnect and reconnect sensors when leaving and entering a new facility. Seamless “continuum of care” monitoring—for instance from surgical room to ICUs, including transport in between and without reconnecting sensors—is on top of the wish list by clinician. In recent years, efforts have been made to develop portable ECG monitors and “mobile ICUs”; however so far, no continuous and seamless BP monitoring has been achieved. This proposal fully leverages the outcomes from the related R21 (EB022271) project. We will develop novel machine learning and deep learning based data fusion algorithms to use existing vital signs for continuous BP monitoring, then integrate them with our unique wearable patient monitoring system to form a novel perioperative patient monitoring system. We will test the system’s performance against gold standard a- line and Finapres BP technologies. to develop a fully functional technology for noninvasive, continuous, and seamless BP monitoring. We will also develop a public database for future BP technology development. The proposed multimodality algorithms, seamless BP monitoring system and PhysioNet database will provide major steps forward to meet the clinical need for noninvasive continuous BP monitoring. Project Narrative Continuous blood pressure (BP) is one of the most critical monitoring parameters during anesthesia, surgery and in intensive care units (ICU). However, the current gold standard technology for BP monitoring, the invasive arterial line (a-line), causes patient suffering (physical pain) and increases the risk of infection, and current noninvasive BP technologies have poor stability.

"WildCam: A Privacy Conscious Wearable Eating Detection Camera People will Actually Wear in the Wild Project Summary Behavioral interventions for weight loss include self-monitoring and self-report of diet. However, few people adhere to self-monitoring because they believe it will be a burden. For those who do adhere, biased reporting leads to poor accuracy. Self-report measures have helped us understand contextual factors of problematic eating behaviors, but we cannot validate such relationships to dietary intake and weight because of unreliable reporting. Therefore, we need an objective way to validate self-report measures. Automated self-monitoring, however, can lead to high eating false alarm detection rates (calling something eating when it is not eating). It also requires participants to push buttons during the start and end of a meal. Passive and unobtrusive ways to capture images of food intake would improve accuracy of detection, avoid the need for a person to remember what they ate, and limit bias based on what participants believe to be socially desirable. Such methods could also ease the self-monitoring burden, decrease errors associated with self- report measures, and lay the foundation for understanding when and how problematic eating behaviors occur. Image capture using wearable cameras may help us better understand obesity and its context (that is, the situation in which eating occurs). However, privacy and ethical concerns of bystanders whose images are taken are a significant barrier. Currently there is no privacy-preserving camera that participants are both willing to wear and that provides meaningful information on food intake and context associated with problematic eating behaviors. Several methods exist, known as obfuscation, that can filter unnecessary information in the scene. However, we do not know which method is most acceptable to a person wearing the device in everyday life that would encourage greatest wear-time. Our project aims to determine which method is best for preserving privacy while providing enough information to understand eating behaviors and their context. To do this, we will observe participants in their everyday life, with special attention to eating behaviors. We will use these new image capture techniques to help understand eating behaviors associated with obesity. First, we will select the best obfuscation method by testing the most well-known obfuscation methods in a cross-over trial to identify which method has the greatest participant acceptability and feasibility (compared with no obfuscation). We will test a novel wearable camera with an infrared sensor (allows us to determine objects that are near vs. far in the camera) with 3 obfuscation methods in real-world settings, including a cartooning gaming–based method. We will then select the obfuscation method that increases wear time and design an eating algorithm around it. Using this algorithm we will assess our ability to capture behaviorally meaningful context from the obfuscated image, such as whether people are eating alone or not, at home, using screen time, and eating prepared or cooked food. This will improve current research practices of evaluating dietary intake and pave the way for personalized interventions in behavioral medicine. Project Narrative Obesity treatment would benefit greatly from an accurate understanding of problematic eating behaviors in real-world settings. Wearable video cameras provide significant utility in understanding eating behaviors, yet pose a major privacy concern in the real-world, significantly impacting longitudinal wear time. We are testing a privacy-conscious wearable device that individuals with obesity will wear and that can accurately detect eating, which will advance our understanding of behavioral phenotypes surrounding obesity, laying the foundation for future interventions to change problematic eating behaviors.",WildCam: A Privacy Conscious Wearable Eating Detection Camera People will Actually Wear in the Wild,10109884,R03DK127128,"['Algorithms ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Behavioral Medicine ', ' Energy Intake ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Cartoons ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Environment ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Feeding behaviors ', ' Ingestive Behavior ', ' feeding-related behaviors ', ' nutrient intake activity ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Gestures ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Hand ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Privatization ', ' Reading ', ' Real-Time Systems ', ' realtime systems ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Social Desirability ', ' Social Desirabilities ', ' Temperature ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Video Recording ', ' Videorecording ', ' video recording system ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Privacy ', ' Device Designs ', ' base ', ' career ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Oral cavity ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Mouth ', ' Conscious ', ' Consciousness ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' diet intervention ', ' lightweight ', ' light weight ', ' cooking ', ' Life ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Hour ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' magnetic ', ' Magnetism ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Thorace ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorax ', ' Chest ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Adherence ', ' Detection ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Device ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' Population-based research ', ' Population-level research ', ' Population Research ', ' Food Patterns ', ' Monitor ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' food consumption ', ' obesity treatment ', ' obesity intervention ', ' obesity therapy ', ' tv watching ', ' screen time ', ' television watching ', ' feeding ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' willingness ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' weight loss intervention ', ' weight loss therapy ', ' weight loss treatment ', ' usability ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Secure ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' Cross-Over Trials ', ' Crossover Trials ', ' crowdsourcing ', ' crowd source ', ' crowd-sourcing ', ' crowdsource ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' preservation ', ' adult obesity ', ' adult adiposity ', ' adults with obesity ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' privacy preservation ', ' behavioral phenotyping ', ' behavior phenotype ', ' acceptability and feasibility ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R03,2021,116737,IL-07
"BandPass: A Remote Monitoring System for Sarcopenia and Functional Decline ABSTRACT Clinical Need: As the US population ages, managing pathologies that largely affect older adults, including sarcopenia (e.g., loss of muscle mass and strength), represents a significant and growing clinical challenge. In addition to increased rates of sarcopenia with age, it is well-accepted that its incidence and impact increases after acute illness, placing persons at additional risk for functional decline, institutionalization, or death. Resistance-based exercises promote muscle regeneration and strength, and are an advised therapy for such patients. Yet, exercises are normally conducted either under direct clinical oversight, or unsupervised by patients at home, where compliance rates are low. Limitations: Current regimens rely on self-report diaries or verbal reports that may be inaccurate and subject to recall bias. Remote monitoring systems that measure, track, analyze, and provide patient-oriented feedback may overcome these limitations and enhance exercise regimen engagement. An at-home device that monitors and transmits exercise data to the user and clinician represents a potential solution to this clinical challenge. Our Product – BandPass is a remote-sensing, bluetooth-enabled resistance exercise band that will accurately gauge force through a potentiometric sensor rigidly fixed to elastic-tubing purposely designed for resistance training. The device is similar to currently available exercise bands familiar to clinicians and patients, with the significant novel addition of integrated force monitoring and internet-connectivity. A mobile app and cloud-based platform will provide computational resources for data visualization, storage and analysis, which will enable direct patient feedback, clinical monitoring of patient compliance and progress, and serve as a platform for more advanced operations such as automatic exercise-type classification to ease user burden (e.g., minimizing required interactions between the user and mobile device). We hypothesize that BandPass will provide clinically relevant data on compliance and use of exercise training with feedback that will be personalized. Specific Objectives: We specifically propose to design custom electronics and housing for BandPass and to perform in-lab validation studies of device accuracy, precision, and long-term stability. BandPass will be interfaced to a mobile app and cloud-based platform we will implement for data transmission, storage, and analysis. Finally, we will deploy BandPass in a human subjects pilot study to demonstrate usability and system stability in an at-home setting. Future Directions: SynchroHealth is a small company developing an mHealth platform that uses internet-connected devices to help improve quality of life in older adults. This device will complement our existing efforts. By the end of this Phase 1 effort, we will have demonstrated that BandPass is functional in a human population and we will have provided evidence that this approach can be deployed effectively in an at-home setting. This will position us for Phase 2 funding focused on optimizing our device for manufacturing, developing and optimizing a full suite of cloud-based analysis tools and mobile applications, conducting clinical trials aimed at demonstrating efficacy, and preparing to register this as a 510(k)-exempt device for marketing purposes and establishing Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP). PROJECT NARRATIVE Clinical care for older adults that suffer from sarcopenia (e.g. loss of muscle mass and strength) typically involves the use of physical therapy regimens that rely on patients performing a series of at-home resistance-based exercises in order to retain or build muscle strength and prevent further atrophy. Resistance exercises using elastic bands has been a primary tool for clinicians, however remotely monitoring a patient’s compliance, confirming the quality of exercises performed, and tracking performance has been a significant challenge, with no tools currently available to provide this level of insight. Here, we propose to develop BandPass, an internet-enable resistance exercise band instrumented to automatically sense forces generated during exercise which will enable remote monitoring, compliance checking, and exercise classification and help to overcome the current shortcomings in clinical management of these patients.",BandPass: A Remote Monitoring System for Sarcopenia and Functional Decline,10152884,R41AG071290,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', ' Boston ', ' Capital ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electronics ', ' electronic device ', ' Equipment ', ' Exercise ', ' Faculty ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Health ', ' Housing ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Inpatients ', ' Institutionalization ', ' Interview ', ' Marketing ', ' Muscular Atrophy ', ' Muscle Atrophy ', ' muscle breakdown ', ' muscle degradation ', ' muscle deterioration ', ' muscle loss ', ' muscle wasting ', ' Persons ', ' Orthopedics ', ' Orthopedic ', ' Orthopedic Surgical Profession ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patents ', ' Pathology ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Risk ', ' Self-Help Devices ', ' Assistive Technology ', ' assisted device ', ' assistive device ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Syndrome ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Businesses ', ' Custom ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' insight ', ' Recovery ', ' muscle form ', ' muscle bulk ', ' muscle mass ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Atrophy ', ' Atrophic ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' diaries ', ' System ', ' Physical Function ', ' muscle strength ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' monitoring device ', ' Performance ', ' participatory sensing ', ' remote sensing ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' validation studies ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Sampling ', ' sarcopenic ', ' sarcopenia ', ' muscle strengthening ', ' resistance training ', ' strength training ', ' Physiatric Procedure ', ' Physical Medicine Procedure ', ' Physical Therapeutics ', ' Physiotherapy ', ' Physical therapy ', ' Drops ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' patient cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' treatment compliance ', ' compliance behavior ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Conduct Clinical Trials ', ' Non-Invasive Cancer Detection ', ' Non-Invasive Detection ', ' Noninvasive Cancer Detection ', ' Noninvasive Detection ', ' Small Business Technology Transfer Research ', ' STTR ', ' Validation ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' wireless ', ' Monitor ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Process ', ' muscle regeneration ', ' functional decline ', ' decline in function ', ' decline in functional status ', ' functional status decline ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' usability ', ' commercialization ', ' clinical care ', ' data exchange ', ' data transfer ', ' data transmission ', ' Regimen ', ' operation ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' cloud computer ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile device application ', ' cloud based ', ' data visualization ', ' exercise regimen ', ' Exercise routine ', ' age-related muscle loss ', ' age associated muscle atrophy ', ' age-associated decline in muscle ', ' age-associated muscle decline ', ' age-associated muscle deterioration ', ' age-associated muscle loss ', ' age-associated muscle wasting ', ' age-related decline in muscle ', ' age-related muscle decline ', ' age-related muscle deterioration ', ' age-related muscle wasting ', ' exercise training ', ' resistance exercise ', ' Cloud Service ', ' Android ', ' clinical development ', ' Bluetooth ', ' Infrastructure ', ' acceptability and feasibility ', ' remote monitoring ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIA,SYNCHROHEALTH LLC,R41,2021,224700,NH-02
"Development of the Strength Band Platform, a Technology Assisted Therapy Platform to Aid with Opioid Abuse Treatment. PROJECT SUMMARY Opioid overdose rates have risen six-fold since the late 1990s and presently claim the lives of over 130 Americans each day. Amongst treatment options for opioid dependence, medication-assisted treatment (MAT) with opioid substitutes, such as methadone or buprenorphine maintenance, are the only treatments for which effectiveness has been confirmed by empirical study. While methadone maintenance is effective for reducing mortality over the course of treatment, individuals remain at significant risk of overdose death during the initial phase of treatment (methadone induction). On the other hand, although buprenorphine has lower risk of mortality, it is associated with greater risk of withdrawal and relapse. Therefore, patient monitoring is critical for effective MAT, improved treatment retention and reduced likelihood of overdose death. Yet, MAT is most commonly administered on an outpatient basis, limiting the time periods during which the patient can be actively assessed. OpiAID is developing the Strength Band Platform, a wearable device featuring a multi-sensor array and artificial intelligence to facilitate patient monitoring during MAT for opioid use disorder. This device will provide an expanded range of biometric variables enabling prediction of opioid use and withdrawal in real world settings. Real-time monitoring of patients will allow appropriate and timely interventions, directly improving the outcomes for the patients undergoing the treatment. There are currently no FDA approved, commercially available, wearable products for monitoring opioid use in real world settings. This Phase I SBIR program consists of two Specific Aims designed to develop the Strength Band Platform using a commercially available clinically validated armband. The first Specific Aim is to collect biometric variables from patients and develop prediction algorithms through supervised learning. In the second Specific Aim, barriers to end-user adoption, compliance and social stigma will be identified through focus groups and solutions based on the feedback will be incorporated into development frameworks. Completion of this Phase I project will produce a proof-of-concept platform which will undergo further development and evaluation for commercialization. Phase II research will focus on developing fully functional user and practitioner interfaces and completing multi-region clinical trials to demonstrate efficacy and effectiveness of the platform for improving patient outcomes. OpiAID will leverage extensive partnerships in the opioid dependence treatment community in Wilmington, NC to evaluate performance of the device and complete the clinical trials. Ultimately, identifying periods of increased risk of relapse will allow provision of just-in-time interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE To address the opioid crisis, OpiAID is developing a wearable biometric device platform that will predict use and withdrawal in patients undergoing medication-assisted therapy for opioid use disorder. Using a wearable device for real-time monitoring with predictive capability will allow timely interventions resulting in fewer deaths and relapses.","Development of the Strength Band Platform, a Technology Assisted Therapy Platform to Aid with Opioid Abuse Treatment.",10339121,R43DA050399,"['Adoption ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Buprenorphine ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methadone ', ' Adanon ', ' Althose ', ' Dolophine ', ' Methadose ', ' mortality ', ' opioid abuse ', ' opiate abuse ', ' opiate drug abuse ', ' opioid drug abuse ', ' opioid withdrawal ', ' opiate withdrawal ', ' opioid detox ', ' opioid detoxification ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Withdrawal ', ' programs ', ' Opiate Dependence ', ' opioid addiction ', ' opioid dependence ', ' opioid dependent ', ' Opiate Addiction ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' Devices ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Opioid Rotation ', ' Narcotic Rotation ', ' Narcotic Substitution ', ' Narcotic Switching ', ' Opioid Substitution ', ' Opioid Switching ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' commercialization ', ' FDA approved ', ' overdose death ', ' overdose fatalities ', ' opioid use disorder ', ' opiate use disorder ', ' improved outcome ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' medication-assisted treatment ', ' opioid use ', ' opiate consumption ', ' opiate drug use ', ' opiate intake ', ' opiate use ', ' opioid consumption ', ' opioid drug use ', ' opioid intake ', ' relapse risk ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' opiate crisis ', ' opioid crisis ', ' opioid therapy ', ' opiate therapy ', ' opioid overdose ', ' opiate overdose ', ' opiate related overdose ', ' opioid drug overdose ', ' opioid induced overdose ', ' opioid intoxication ', ' opioid medication overdose ', ' opioid poisoning ', ' opioid related overdose ', ' opioid toxicity ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' overdose risk ', ' methadone treatment ', ' methadone maintenance ', ' methadone maintenance program ', ' methadone maintenance therapy ', ' methadone maintenance treatment ', ' real time monitoring ', ' realtime monitoring ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' ']",NIDA,"OPIAID, LLC",R43,2021,55000,NC-07
"An Unobtrusive Continuous Cuff-less Blood Pressure Monitor for Nocturnal Hypertension PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The objective of this project is to create an unobtrusive, wrist-worn, cuff-less blood pressure monitor for measurement and identification of nocturnal nondipping hypertension. The investigation includes extensive validation with state-of-the-art ambulatory blood pressure monitors at nighttime in presence of heterogeneous treatment paradigms. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the major causes of ailments worldwide. Hypertension alone affects one in three adults according to the World Health Organization. Therefore, monitoring blood pressure has become a critical part of healthcare as it is known to be linked to many CVDs. Traditionally, clinical practitioners have relied on the mercury-based (or digital equivalent) inflatable cuff-based sphygmomanometer. However, the nature of the device allows for only infrequent measurements and its somewhat invasive nature and associated discomfort prohibits additional nocturnal measurements. There is certainly a value to measuring blood pressure continuously in the natural context of the user’s environment, in particular during sleep, without being disturbed by the instrument. Our proposed technology can provide a wealth of information to physicians, help identify certain short-term dynamics/variations of blood pressure, and allow effective monitoring of response to medication, among other things. Nocturnal measurements provide additional prognostic value in identifying risk. Despite these benefits, no wearable, non-invasive device for continuous blood pressure monitoring exists on the market simply because none have been reliable enough to be considered clinical grade. This project aims to develop a robust and reliable blood pressure monitor in the form of a wrist-worn device that uses bio-impedance sensors, and for the first time, demonstrate clinical grade reliability. These sensors measure pulse wave velocity (PWV) along with several other derivatives for cardiovascular parameters including heart rate and blood volume changes in arteries, which correlate with the blood pressure. The system will incorporate clever hardware design to localize underlying vasculature and focus on arterial sites for enhanced accuracy. The device will include a motion sensor to take into account the user’s movements and motion artifacts, the contact quality, and reliability of the measurements. Advanced machine learning techniques, leveraging both general and personalized models, will be developed to convert bio-impedance measurements to blood pressure. This project aims to then validate the system and analytics in both a healthy patient cohort and a hypertensive cohort, learning the impact that nocturnal ‘nondipping’ hypertension and anti-hypertensive treatments have on PWV/other cardiovascular correlates and blood pressure estimates. After decades of relying on the inflatable cuff- based technique, this system could represent a significant change in how we measure blood pressure. PROJECT NARRATIVE Continuous monitoring of nocturnal blood pressure can help early diagnosis of developing cardiac conditions, reveal short term blood pressure variations, and also help the physician monitor differences in variations in response to medication for hypertensive patients. Moreover, the comfort and convenience of a wearable monitor would allow measurement in the natural context of daily life, including important nocturnal measurements, and reduce the burden of adherence on the user.

"COVID-19 detection through scent analysis with a compact GC device Recent studies, including ours, have suggested that breath may allow us to diagnose COVID-19 infection and even monitor its progress. As compared to immunological and genetic based methods using sample media like blood, nasopharyngeal swab, and saliva, breath analysis is non-invasive, simple, safe, and inexpensive; it allows a nearly infinite amount of sample volume and can be used at the point-of-care for rapid detection. Fundamentally, breath also provides critical metabolomics information regarding how human body responds to virus infection and medical intervention (such as drug treatment and mechanical ventilation). The objectives of the proposed SCENT project are: (1) to refine automated, portable, high-performance micro-gas chromatography (GC) device and related data analysis / biomarker identification algorithms for rapid (5-6 minutes), in-situ, and sensitive (down to ppt) breath analysis and (2) to conduct breath analysis on up to 760 patients, and identify and validate the COVID-19 biomarkers in breath. Thus, in coordination with the RADx-rad Data Coordination Center (DCC), we will complete the following specific aims. (1) Refine 5 automated micro-GC devices to achieve higher speed and better separation capability. We will construct 5 new automated and portable one-dimensional micro-GC devices that require only ~6 minutes of assay time (improved from current 20 minutes) at the ppt level sensitivity (Sub-Aim 1a). Then the devices will be upgraded to 2-dimensional micro-GC to significantly increase the separation capability (Sub-Aim 1b). In the meantime, we will optimize and automate our existing data processing and biomarker identification algorithms and codes to streamline the workflow so that the GC device can automatically process and analyze the data without human intervention (Sub-Aim 1c). (2) Identify breath biomarkers that distinguish COVID-19 positive (symptomatic and asymptomatic) and negative patients. We will recruit a training cohort of 380 participants, including 190 COVID-19 positive patients (95 symptomatic and 95 asymptomatic) and 190 COVID-19 negative patients from two hospitals (Michigan Medicine – Ann Arbor and the Henry Ford Hospital – Detroit). We will conduct breath analysis using machine learning to identify VOC patterns that match each COVID-19 diagnostic status. (3) Validate the COVID-19 biomarkers using our refined micro-GC devices. Using the refined 2-D micro-GC devices from Sub-Aim 1b, we will recruit a new validation cohort of 380 participants (190 COVID-19 positive patients and 190 COVID-19 negative patients) to validate the biomarkers identified in Aim 2.  We will leverage existing engineering, data science, clinical, regulatory, and commercialization resources throughout the project to hit our milestones, ensuring a high likelihood of rapid patient impact. Upon completion of this work, we will have a portable micro-GC device and accompanying automated algorithms that can detect and monitor COVID-19 status for people in a variety of clinical and community settings. Narrative  Our team of engineers, clinicians, and data scientists has developed a portable, high performance breath analyzer that can be used to detect certain diseases. In this project, we will adapt and refine our existing device and algorithms so they can be used for rapid, safe, and non- invasive COVID-19 detection. People will simply breath into the device and it will quickly provide results, meaning that it can be used in a variety of everyday settings to help fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.",COVID-19

"Quantitative histopathology for cancer prognosis using quantitative phase imaging on stained tissues Summary Fast, accurate, and scalable testing has been recognized unanimously as crucial for mitigating the impact of COVID-19 and future pandemics. We propose a technology that allows rapid (~2 minutes) testing for SARS CoV-2. Our technology combines novel label-free imaging and dedicated deep-learning algorithms to detect and classify viral populations in exhaled air. If successful, this project will result in a device based on quantitative phase imaging and integrated AI tools, which will detect the unlabeled virus acquired by the patient’s breath condensed on a microscope slide. Toward this goal, we will advance Spatial Light Interference Microscopy (SLIM), an ultrasensitive label-free imaging technique, proven to measure structures down to the sub-nanometer scale. SLIM was developed in the PI’s Lab at UIUC, its original publication received 490 citations to date, and has been commercialized by Phi Optics (Research Park, UIUC), with sales across the world in both academia and industry. Applying the computed fluorescence maps back to the QPI data, we propose to measure nanoscale features of viral particles, with high specificity, minimal preparation time, and independent of clinical infrastructure. As a result, the new technology will eventually be ideal for point-of-care settings, surveillance screening and as a home monitoring device. We anticipate that our approach will be scalable to other viruses, with new imaging and training data. Narrative We propose a breath test using label-free imaging and AI: an individual exhales on a microscope slide, which is fed into a SLIM microscope equipped with a computer that runs deep-learning pre-trained algorithms for SARS CoV-2 identification.

"BGscope: a non-invasive, continuous, and accurate O2 AND CO2 sensing PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Blood gases are the primary indicators of effectiveness of ventilation, circulation and perfusion in neonates. Every year ~ 4 million babies are born in the United States. Of these, 15% (~500,000) suffer from respiratory distress mainly due to prematurity and/or low birth weight. These babies are transferred to the neonatology intensive care unit (NICU) immediately after birth, for whom approximately 10 million blood gas tests are performed annually. The gold standard of measuring blood gases are invasive procedures where blood is drawn through arterial lines connected to the umbilical cord, through needle pokes of the heel (known as heel stick) for capillary blood or through a venous line. While arterial sampling provides the highest accuracy, it is not easy to perform and poses a high risk of infection; capillary sampling is the most frequently performed procedure, with the consequences of being painful and a high chance of sample clotting; venous sampling is very easy to perform with the least accuracy among all the previous methods. Therefore, non-invasive, continuous monitoring devices are essential to avoid the adverse effects of the blood gas test. Oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2), are the most important respiratory gases, and their partial pressures (PO2 and PCO2) and oxygen saturation (SO2) collectively reflect the overall adequacy of respiratory function. Conventional O2 sensors (popularly known as pulse oximeters) are based on optical spectrophotometry technology and are relatively large to be placed on the limb of the premature/ preterm neonate and consequently lose signal integrity. CO2 sensors (popularly known as transcutaneous CO2) detect the dissolved CO2 gas in blood through skin by depositing heat onto a localized capillary bed. In both cases, the blood gas measurement is at the capillary level and is unable to provide the accuracy of the gold standard. In addition, these sensors are capable of only measuring one of two blood gases. Moreover, continuous operation of these sensors generates heat and may damage the sensitive skin of neonates. Therefore, frequent repositioning of the sensor is required, and further blood draws are necessary for the sensor recalibration. Our product non-invasively measures arterial blood gas; partial pressures of O2 and CO2 (PO2 and PCO2) and SO2. It is a simple wristband that can be used at the wrist or ankle. It does not generate heat or damage sensitive tissue. It continuously measures arterial blood gases (O2 and CO2) with high accuracy. Our proposed device will help reducing the blood draws from NICU babies by ~75%. We have named it BGScope for Blood Gas Scope. BGScope works based on the principles of multispectral photoacoustic imaging. Our short-term goals are: (i) to develop the BGScope device and a computational kernel to non-invasively measure arterial blood gases including, partial pressures of O2 and CO2 and oxygen saturation (SO2); and (ii) to conduct a pilot study to evaluate the BGScope on rabbits.

"Sensor-based Just-in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) Targeting Eating Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Long-term weight control is difficult to achieve and requires permanent changes in eating behavior. Emerging wearable sensor technology enables accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior, and real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for development of individually tailored and immediately delivered intervention (just-in-time adaptive Intervention; JITAI) to change eating behavior. Grounded in empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for weight control, the proposed project relies on the synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning, behavioral science, personalized medicine, and nutrition to deliver and test such JITAIs. We previously developed a wearable sensor, the Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), that automatically and accurately detects eating and characterizes meal microstructure (e.g., eating duration, rate of ingestion). These data can also be used to accurately estimate energy intake. The goals of this project are to: 1) use the AIM to study two common behavioral patterns observed among individuals with overweight/obesity, namely, excessive total daily energy intake (EI) and fast eating rate; 2) define the optimal personalized triggering metrics for two JITAIs targeting these behaviors; and 3) evaluate JITAIs’ effects on daily energy intake and targeted behaviors. In fulfillment of these goals, we will first conduct a study to characterize the target eating behaviors, then simulate and define triggering metrics for personalized JITAIs to change targeted eating behaviors and decrease EI. The JITAIs are rooted in self-regulation theory (SRT): setting a behavioral goal and monitoring progress toward that goal, with feedback to reinforce success. To enable the SRT-informed JITAIs, we will first use the AIM to collect data about ingestive behaviors quantified by objective, sensor-measured metrics from 90 adults with overweight/obesity who will wear the device for one week in free living conditions. Second, using the collected dataset, we will: a) analyze individual curves of cumulative daily EI and rate of eating within eating episodes to define triggering parameters for personalized JITAI delivery, and b) numerically simulate JITAI delivery and effects. We will then conduct a second study to evaluate the immediate effect of JITAIs on EI and ingestive behavior in free living participants. We will conduct a within-subjects trial with 128 adults wearing the AIM for 7 weeks. To personalize JITAIs, the AIM will learn individual eating patterns over a 1-week run-in period. Each JITAI will be delivered for two weeks (weeks 2-3 and 5-6) in a randomized crossover design with the resulting daily EI and ingestive behavior compared to baseline and the acceptability of the JITAIs assessed via questionnaire. On washout weeks 4 and 7, participants will continue to wear the AIM (no JITAIs) to assess persistence of intervention effects. The proposed project is the first step in demonstrating that AIM-based JITAIs can alter a variety of eating behaviors associated with excess EI. PROJECT NARRATIVE Achievement of changes in eating behaviors that facilitate long-term weight loss and maintenance is elusive. Emerging wearable sensor technology allows for accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior. Real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for individually tailored just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) based on empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for healthy eating and weight control. The proposed project relies on synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning, behavioral science, personalized medicine, and nutrition to test two such JITAIs driven by the Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), a device that automatically detects and characterize eating behavior in real-time. The information provided by the AIM will be used to implement and test personalized, adaptable behavioral interventions aimed at the reduction of energy intake.",Sensor-based Just-in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) Targeting Eating Behavior,10425512,R01DK122473,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Energy Intake ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating Disorders ', ' Feedback ', ' Feeding behaviors ', ' Ingestive Behavior ', ' feeding-related behaviors ', ' nutrient intake activity ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Learning ', ' Mastication ', ' Chewing ', ' chewed ', ' chews ', ' nutrition ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Running ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' body weight loss ', ' wt-loss ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' increased appetite ', ' Appetite stimulated ', ' Increased food appetite ', ' increased hunger ', ' Ingestion ', ' sucking ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Crossover Design ', ' Cross-Over Designs ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pattern ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' behavior change ', ' success ', ' synergism ', ' simulation ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' weight control ', ' weight management ', ' Weight maintenance regimen ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' BMI ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' weight maintenance ', ' cost ', ' Population ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' intervention effect ', ' clinical practice ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' healthy weight ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable biosensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' adaptive intervention ', ' obese person ', ' obese individuals ', ' obese people ', ' obese population ', ' obese subjects ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IN TUSCALOOSA,R01,2021,61011,AL-07
"A mobile sensing system to monitor symptoms during chemotherapy Cancer treatments can cause a variety of poorly-managed symptoms and toxicities that can impair quality of life and functioning and lead to early discontinuation of life-prolonging medical treatment. The goals of the proposed study are (1) to develop a novel mobile sensing system to passively monitor symptom burden during chemotherapy and (2) to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using this system to recommend patient-provider communication. To accomplish Aim 1, we will enroll 200 oncology patients starting a new chemotherapy regimen and will collect smartphone and wearable sensor data continuously as well as daily patient-reported symptoms via smartphones for 90 days. Using machine learning methods, we will retrospectively analyze data from the first 100 participants and develop a generalizable and parsimonious population-level model to identify severe symptom days. For the second 100 participants, we will run these computational models in real-time and prospectively evaluate the accuracy of our classifications relative to patient-reported symptoms. For Aim 2, we will enroll 50 patients in a prospective single-arm trial of a system that uses inferences based on sensing and machine learning to recommend contact with providers and will evaluate patient accrual, attrition, and compliance as well as information from both patients and their providers about acceptability and perceived usefulness of the system. The scientific premise of this proposal is that mobile sensing of subtle fluctuations in behavior coupled with real-time computational modeling could enable earlier detection and ultimately better management of severe symptoms during cancer treatment. The proposed project builds on our prior research and completes the necessary development and feasibility work to support a large multisite trial comparing the mobile sensing system to standard of care to determine effects on symptom burden, quality of life, health care utilization, and survival. Public health relevance: Symptoms during cancer treatment are common, compromise patient quality of life and ability to tolerate treatment, and often go undetected at clinic visits. This project aims to combine smartphone and wearable sensor data with machine learning to remotely monitor symptoms during chemotherapy and to develop a system that automatically recommends patient-provider contact when severe symptoms are detected.",A mobile sensing system to monitor symptoms during chemotherapy,10218121,R37CA242545,"['Behavior ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Communication ', ' Goals ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Noise ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Running ', ' Sleep ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' aberrant sleep ', ' disrupted sleep ', ' disturbed sleep ', ' impaired sleep ', ' irregular sleep ', ' sleep disruption ', ' sleep dysregulation ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Physical activity ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' Oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Chemotherapy Protocol ', ' Chemotherapy Regimen ', ' Chemotherapy, Cancer, General ', ' Combination Chemotherapy Regimen ', ' Quimioterapia ', ' cancer chemotherapy ', ' Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure ', ' Notification ', ' Severities ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' care delivery ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Social Support System ', ' Support System ', ' Modeling ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer-directed therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' cancer care ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Provider ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' symptom management ', ' manage symptom ', ' Behavioral ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Coupled ', ' Impairment ', ' chemotherapy ', ' trial comparing ', ' public health relevance ', ' standard of care ', ' common treatment ', ' multi-site trial ', ' multisite trial ', ' Secure ', ' arm ', ' sedentary lifestyle ', ' Sedentary behavior ', ' Sedentary life-style ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile technology ', ' Prospective cohort study ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable biosensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' patient-clinician communication ', ' patient-doctor communication ', ' patient-provider communication ', ' care outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' acceptability and feasibility ', ' remote monitoring ', ' feasibility testing ', ' patient-provider contact ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R37,2021,361146,PA-18
