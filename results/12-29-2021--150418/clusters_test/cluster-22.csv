"Neural mechanisms of active vision in the fovea Neural mechanisms of active vision in the fovea In many ways human vision is like a camera, with a lens that forms an image on a spatially arranged sensor (the retina). However, it is unlike a camera because the sensor has uneven sampling and is constantly moving with the eyes. Recent behavioral and theoretical work suggest these eye movements serve a faciliatory role in high acuity vision – where the eye movements are part of the computations and enhance spatial resolution. However, the neurophysiological mechanisms to support this facilitation remain unknown. More broadly, little is known about the neural mechanisms that integrate across the retinal motion generated by eye movements, especially in the central visual field (the fovea). This is particularly important because over 8 million Americans suffer from central vision loss due to retinal disorders. Even if the retinal signals could be repaired, it is imperative to understand how the brain reads out foveal signals to ensure recovery of high-acuity visual processing, and fixational eye movements are a part of that process. The proposed career development plan aims to address these questions by measuring visual processing in the foveal representation of primary visual cortex (V1) during natural visual behavior. This proposal uses custom high-resolution eye-tracking, a novel visual foraging paradigm, largescale neurophysiology, and state-of-the-art machine learning to make these measurements possible. The proposed research will not only generate fundamental understanding of how eye-movements facilitate visual processing, but also will integrate the experimental and theoretical tools required to support neurophysiological studies of active visual processing without a loss of rigor or detail. The candidate has extensive expertise in awake- behaving neurophysiology and computational modeling and the training plan is designed to support his further training in statistical modeling, high-resolution eye-tracking, and modern machine-learning techniques for analyzing neural population data. The primary mentor, Dr. Daniel Butts, is a world expert in statistical models of neural activity during active vision; Co-mentor, Dr. Michele Rucci, is a world leader in high-resolution eye tracking and theoretical approaches to active vision; and Co-mentor, Dr. Jude Mitchell, is a pioneer in establishing the marmoset model of visual neuroscience and an expert in neurophysiology of visual attention. Together, they will provide the guidance to establish the candidate’s transition to a successful independent research career. The goal of this proposal is to identify the impact of fixational eye movements on neural representations in visual cortex in the central visual field. Over 9 million Americans have central vision loss from age-related macular degeneration. Results from this proposal will build a fundamental understanding of how retinal signals from the fovea are processed by visual cortex during natural visual behavior.",Neural mechanisms of active vision in the fovea,10106203,K99EY032179,"['Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Callithrix ', ' Hapale ', ' Marmosets ', ' Short-Tusked Marmoset ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye Movements ', ' Foundations ', ' fovea centralis ', ' Fovea ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Mentors ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Modernization ', ' Monkeys ', ' Motion ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Physiology ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Research ', ' Retina ', ' Retinal Diseases ', ' Retinal Disorder ', ' retina disease ', ' retina disorder ', ' retinopathy ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Saccades ', ' Saccadic Eye Movements ', ' Saccadic Pursuit ', ' Esthesia ', ' Sensation ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' statistics ', ' area striata ', ' Primary visual cortex ', ' Striate Cortex ', ' Striate area ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual Acuity ', ' Visual Cortex ', ' visual cortical ', ' Visual Fields ', ' eye field ', ' Visual Pathways ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' career ', ' sensor ', ' Peripheral ', ' repaired ', ' repair ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' awake ', ' Visual ', ' receptive field ', ' Recovery ', ' Age related macular degeneration ', ' Age-Related Maculopathy ', ' age related macular dystrophy ', ' senile macular disease ', ' Measurement ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequencies ', ' Stream ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' interest ', ' visual processing ', ' Visual attention ', ' American ', ' eye tracking ', ' visual tracking ', ' professor ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' sample fixation ', ' Fixation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' extrastriate ', ' spatial vision ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' extrastriate visual cortex ', ' extrastriate area ', ' extrastriate cortex ', ' visual area ', ' neural model ', ' V1 neuron ', ' V4 neuron ', ' active vision ', ' visual neuroscience ', ' visual information ', ' visual process ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' central visual field ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' retinal imaging ', ' retina imaging ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NEI,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",K99,2021,116969,MD-05
"Access to parietal action representations after stroke lesions in visual cortex PROJECT SUMMARY  The ability to recognize and use objects according to their function (e.g., fork, hammer, pencil) requires integration of visual, semantic and action knowledge across occipital, temporal and parietal areas. Left parietal regions support critical aspects of object-directed action, such as grasping and object manipulation. This research activity uses a combination of fMRI and behavioral measures in patients with ischemic strokes to early and extrastriate visual areas to test the following hypotheses: Aim 1: There is a visual pathway to the parietal grasp region (aIPS) that bypasses processing in primary visual cortex. Aim 2: Left ventral extrastriate cortex is necessary to access manipulation information for visually presented objects. Aim 3A: Ballistic grasping actions to objects in the hemianopic field are influenced by volumetric properties (size, orientation) of targets. Aim 3B: Left ventral extrastriate lesions impair object function (e.g., `scissors used to cut') and disrupt access to manipulation knowledge from visual input. The research leverages strengths of fMRI (whole brain correlational measure) and neuropsychology (causal inference) to test new hypotheses about vision and action.  `Tools' (i.e., small manipulable objects) are an excellent domain in which to address broader questions about the integration of sensory, motor and cognitive processing. This is because tool recognition and tool use require the integration of distinct sensory, motor and cognitive representations, and the neural substrates of tool processing are well described. The research program emphasizes fresh perspectives on longstanding ideas about the dorsal and ventral visual pathways, by a) undertaking the first systematic investigation of the types of information about objects that are extracted by visual pathways that bypass primary visual cortex, and by b) studying how some parietal areas depend on inputs from the ventral stream in order to access the correct action for a given object. The research activity innovates by testing hypotheses about how lesions at different stages in the cortical visual hierarchy affect downstream processing in parietal cortex, combining neural and behavioral measures to study brain damaged patients (generating causal evidence), and by combining univariate and multivariate measures to `read out' the information content of brain regions (parietal cortex) that are anatomically remote from a lesion. The research advances understanding of how lesions in one brain region disrupt computations in other parts of the brain that depend on the damaged region for their inputs, a phenomenon (`dynamic diaschisis') that applies to brain injury generally. Advancing understanding of these basic issues using causal data has broad implications for understanding how the brain selects the correct action for the correct object, and more generally for theories of conceptual organization and causal reasoning. Understanding how the brain accesses actions from visual input has implications for related fields, such as robotics, neuroprosthetics, and evidenced based approaches for rehabilitating function after brain injury. Project Narrative Functional MRI and behavioral testing are used to test hypotheses about how strokes affecting occipital and temporal cortex disrupt access to action representations in parietal cortex. This research will advance understanding of how the brain processes visual information in support of everyday actions.",Access to parietal action representations after stroke lesions in visual cortex,10130533,R01EY028535,"['Affect ', ' Alexia ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' fovea centralis ', ' Fovea ', ' Goals ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Neural Pathways ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Occipital lobe ', ' occipital cortex ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Patients ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Robotics ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Semantics ', ' area striata ', ' Primary visual cortex ', ' Striate Cortex ', ' Striate area ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Testing ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual Cortex ', ' visual cortical ', ' Visual Fields ', ' eye field ', ' Visual Pathways ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Left ', ' Dorsal ', ' Area ', ' grasp ', ' Grips ', ' Lesion ', ' Structure of supramarginal gyrus ', ' Supramarginal Gyrus ', ' Parahippocampal Gyrus ', ' Gyrus Hippocampi ', ' Gyrus Parahippocampalis ', ' Hippocampal Gyrus ', ' Stimulus ', ' Prosopagnosia ', ' Agnosia for Faces ', ' Facial Recognition Agnosia ', ' Visual ', ' Research Activity ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' brain damage ', ' brain-injured ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Parietal ', ' Stream ', ' Sensory ', ' Location ', ' Visual System ', ' Visual system structure ', ' visual processing ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neuro-prosthetic ', ' neuroprosthetic ', ' neuroprosthesis ', ' sensory integration ', ' Participant ', ' behavioral test ', ' behavior test ', ' Bypass ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' Ballistics ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Device ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' post stroke ', ' after stroke ', ' poststroke ', ' Behavioral Assay ', ' blind ', ' visual motor ', ' visuomotor ', ' Population ', ' extrastriate ', ' extrastriate visual cortex ', ' extrastriate area ', ' extrastriate cortex ', ' visual area ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' visual object processing ', ' visual information ', ' visual process ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' information processing ', ' evidence base ', ' multisensory ', ' cognitive development ', ' Grain ', ' ']",NEI,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,410316,PA-18
"Function and circuitry of adaptive inhibition in the retina Studies of the visual system face a number of challenges, two of which are the intricacy of the cell types and synaptic connections that comprise the nervous system, and the complexity of the computational processes that underlie vision. Although the retina is one of the most characterized and well understood neural circuits of the visual system, it nonetheless has a great diversity of cell types, connections and computations. The normal function of the retina is to convey information about natural visual scenes, which have complex spatial and temporal structure. The processing of natural scenes has the greatest relevance towards a fundamental understanding retinal function, and the greatest clinical relevance. Yet most studies of retinal visual processing and circuitry focus on responses to simple artificial stimuli rarely encountered normally, such as flashing spots, drifting stripes and flickering checkerboards. With respect to retinal cell types greatest diversity lies in a class of inhibitory interneurons known as amacrine cells. These cells make extensive lateral and feedback connections, and although they form stereotyped connections between each other, excitatory bipolar cells, and ganglion cells that transit signals in the optic nerve, the functional effects of nearly all of these cell types are poorly understood. This proposal aims towards a direct characterization of the functional effects of amacrine cells under ethologically relevant stimuli, including natural scenes. We combine approaches of perturbation and recording using electrical and optical methods as well as computational modeling to characterize the specific contributions of amacrine cells to stimuli that include the representation of moving objects. We take advantage of recently developed computational approaches that can simultaneously capture the retinal response to a broad range of stimuli including natural scenes, capture a wide range of phenomena previously characterized only with artificial stimuli, and that have internal units highly correlated with retinal interneurons. Our goals are to 1) Create a quantitative understanding of the functional contributions of a class of sustained amacrine cells in the salamander retina for specific stimuli including those that represent moving objects and natural scenes, and test hypotheses related to dynamic effects on visual sensitivity and sensory features generated by those amacrine cells 2) Use molecularly defined amacrine cells in the mouse to quantitatively characterize the functional contribution of specific amacrine cell types to specific stimuli including artificial moving objects and natural scenes. These studies create a new way to generate and test hypotheses related to the quantitative effect of any interneuron on retinal output under any visual stimulus. Understanding how retinal circuitry creates visual processing under natural scenes is critical to our understanding of retinal mechanisms and diseases involving the degeneration of the retinal circuitry. In addition, the computational descriptions of retinal responses will be directly useful in the design of electronic retinal prosthesis systems. The retina is a complex network of many cell types, including the most diverse but poorlyunderstood class of cells, amacrine cells. By understanding how inhibitory neurons change neural processing in the retina under natural visual scenes, we can begin to address how these cells and their connections degenerate during retinal diseases, an essential step in designing treatments for these diseases. Furthermore, by creating accurate computational models of the retinal response to natural scenes, this research will be immediately applicable to electronic retinal prosthesis systems that aim to restore vision in cases of photoreceptor degeneration.",Function and circuitry of adaptive inhibition in the retina,10086475,R01EY022933,"['Archives ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Optic Nerve ', ' Cranial Nerve II ', ' Second Cranial Nerve ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Research ', ' Retina ', ' Retinal Degeneration ', ' degenerative retina diseases ', ' retina degeneration ', ' retinal degenerative ', ' retinal degenerative diseases ', ' Retinal Diseases ', ' Retinal Disorder ', ' retina disease ', ' retina disorder ', ' retinopathy ', ' Retinal Ganglion Cells ', ' retinal ganglion ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Theoretical Studies ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Measures ', ' Salamander ', ' Lateral ', ' ganglion cell ', ' gangliocyte ', ' Amacrine Cells ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' receptive field ', ' Spottings ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' extracellular ', ' interest ', ' Visual System ', ' Visual system structure ', ' visual processing ', ' visual stimulus ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Optical Methods ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Output ', ' photoreceptor degeneration ', ' inhibitory neuron ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Population ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' retinal prosthesis ', ' artificial retina ', ' prosthetic retina ', ' retinal prosthetic ', ' biological systems ', ' predicting response ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' connectome ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' Injections ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' sight restoration ', ' restore sight ', ' restore vision ', ' vision restoration ', ' ']",NEI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,380427,CA-18
"Natural image processing in the visual cortex Project Summary Signals from the natural environment are processed by neuronal populations in the cortex. Understanding the relationship between those signals and cortical activity is central to understanding normal cortical function and how it is impaired in psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. Substantial progress has been made in elucidating cortical processing of simple, parametric stimuli, and computational technology is improving descriptions of neural responses to naturalistic stimuli. However, how cortical populations encode the complex, natural inputs received during every day perceptual experience is largely unknown. This project aims to elucidate how natural visual inputs are represented by neuronal populations in primary visual cortex (V1). Progress to date has been limited primarily by two factors. First, during natural vision, the inputs to V1 neurons are always embedded in a spatial and temporal context, but how V1 integrates this contextual information in natural visual inputs is poorly understood. Second, prior work focused almost exclusively on single-neuron firing rate, but to understand cortical representations one must consider the structure of population activity— the substantial trial-to-trial variability that is shared among neurons and evolves dynamically—as this structure influences population information and perception. The central hypothesis of this project is that cortical response structure is modulated by visual context to approximate an optimal representation of natural visual inputs. To test the hypothesis, this project combines machine learning to quantify the statistical properties of natural visual inputs, with a theory of how cortical populations should encode those images to achieve an optimal representation, to arrive at concrete, falsifiable predictions for V1 response structure. The predictions will be tested with measurements of population activity in V1 of awake monkeys viewing natural images and movies. Specific Aim 1 will determine whether modulation of V1 response structure by spatial context in static images is consistent with optimal encoding of those images, and will compare the predictive power of the proposed model to alternative models. Specific Aim 2 addresses V1 encoding of dynamic natural inputs, and will test whether modulation of V1 activity by temporal context is tuned to the temporal structure of natural sensory signals, as required for optimality. As both spatial and temporal are present simultaneously during natural vision, Specific Aim 3 will determine visual input statistics in free-viewing animals, and test space-time interactions in V1 activity evoked by those inputs. This project will provide the first test of a unified functional theory of contextual modulation in V1 encoding of natural visual inputs, and shed light on key aspects of natural vision that have been neglected to date. Project Narrative This project aims to determine how neurons in the visual cortex represent the inputs encountered during perceptual experience in the natural environment, through correct integration of visual information across space and time. In individuals with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, integration is often miscalibrated leading to perceptual impairments. Our study will advance knowledge of the relationship between natural sensory inputs and cortical activity, which is central to understanding normal cortical function and how it is impaired in patient populations.",Natural image processing in the visual cortex,10219265,R01EY030578,"['Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Macaca ', ' Macaque ', ' Monkeys ', ' Motion ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Perception ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' statistics ', ' area striata ', ' Primary visual cortex ', ' Striate Cortex ', ' Striate area ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual Cortex ', ' visual cortical ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Stimulus ', ' awake ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Sensory ', ' Location ', ' experience ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' movie ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' model development ', ' Address ', ' Animal Testing ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' neglect ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' V1 neuron ', ' vision science ', ' visual science ', ' visual information ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' patient population ', ' sensory input ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' ']",NEI,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,404975,NY-14
"Acquisition, extinction, and recall of attention biases to threat: Computational modeling and multimodal brain imaging Project Summary Classical aversive conditioning is a well-established laboratory model for studying acquisition and extinction of defensive responses. In experimental animals, as well as in humans, research to date has been mainly focused on the role of limbic structures (e.g., the amygdala) in these responses. Recent evidence has begun to stress the important contribution by the brain’s sensory and attention control systems in maintaining the neural representations of conditioned responses and in facilitating their extinction. The proposed research breaks new ground by combining novel neuroimaging techniques with advanced computational methods to examine the brain’s visual and attention processes underlying fear acquisition and extinction in humans. Major advances will be made along three specific aims. In Aim 1, we characterize the brain network dynamics of visuocortical threat bias formation, extinction, and recall in a two-day learning paradigm. In Aim 2, we establish and test a computational model of threat bias generalization. In Aim 3, we examine the relation between individual differences in generalization and recall of conditioned visuocortical threat biases and individual differences in heightened autonomic reactivity to conditioned threat, a potential biomarker for assessing the predisposition to developing the disorders of fear and anxiety. It is expected that accomplishing these research aims will address two NIMH strategic priorities: defining the circuitry and brain networks underlying complex behaviors (Objective 1) and identifying and validating new targets for treatment that are derived from the understanding of disease mechanisms (Objective 3). It is further expected that this project will enable a paradigm shift in research on dysfunctional attention to threat from one that focuses primarily on limbic-prefrontal circuits to one that emphasizes the interactions among sensory, attention, executive control and limbic systems. Project Narrative The learning and un-learning of a fear response through conditioning and extinction learning is a process that is of interest not only for basic neuroscience research, but also for clinical intervention and diagnostic procedures in a variety of psychiatric disorders. In the present proposal, building on strong preliminary data that suggest a pivotal role of visual and attention systems, along with limbic structures, in aversive learning, we seek to use simultaneous EEG-fMRI, combined with computational modeling and advanced analytical techniques including machine learning, to characterize—in time and space—the dynamics and communication within and among the brain’s visual, attention and limbic networks during the acquisition and extinction of conditioned fear in healthy populations. Furthermore, testing of the proposed computational model on a community sample stratified by their cardiac reactivity to threat will advance our understanding of the model’s capability to differentiate individual differences in threat response, and lay the foundation for identifying new biomarkers and treatment targets for disorders of fear, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress.","Acquisition, extinction, and recall of attention biases to threat: Computational modeling and multimodal brain imaging",10296986,R01MH125615,"['Acceleration ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Animals ', ' Anxiety ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' classical conditioning ', ' Associative Learning ', ' Pavlovian conditioning ', ' associative conditioning ', ' Cues ', ' Deceleration ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease susceptibility ', ' Diathesis ', ' liability to disease ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Emotions ', ' Visual evoked cortical potential ', ' Visual Evoked Potentials ', ' Visual Evoked Response ', ' Extinction (Psychology) ', ' Extinction ', ' behavioral extinction ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Limbic System ', ' Methods ', ' Study models ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Perception ', ' Psychophysics ', ' psychophysical ', ' Conditioned Reflex ', ' conditioned response ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Scalp structure ', ' Scalp ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Visual Cortex ', ' visual cortical ', ' Visual Perception ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' learning extinction ', ' Measurement ', ' Event-Related Potentials ', ' event related potential ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Complex ', ' Parietal ', ' Sensory ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Visual attention ', ' experience ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' aversive conditioning ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' fear conditioning ', ' conditioned fear ', ' Data ', ' multi-modal imaging ', ' multi-modality imaging ', ' multimodality imaging ', ' Multimodal Imaging ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' Behavioral ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' conditioning ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' visual neuroscience ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' post-traumatic stress ', ' post-trauma stress ', ' posttrauma stress ', ' posttraumatic stress ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' attentional control ', ' attentional bias ', ' potential biomarker ', ' potential biological marker ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' advanced analytics ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2021,450166,FL-03
"Infants' self-generated visual statistics support object and category learning PROJECT SUMMARY Human visual object recognition is remarkable in its ability to recognize individual objects in challenging circumstances and to rapidly recognize even novel instances of tens of thousands of everyday categories. Although a great deal is known about these processes at maturity, very little is known about their development especially with respect to common everyday objects and the experiences that support robust object recognition and categorization. This gap is critical because object recognition and categorization support early word learning, physical problem solving, and the later learning of orthographies and mathematical symbols. This research projects focuses on visual object learning in 1 year old toddlers, a developmental period that at the front end of marked advances in visual object recognition and a period in which children with multiple risk factors begin to fall behind the normative developmental trajectory. The approach focuses on the properties of real- world visual experiences that support learning to recognize individual objects in challenging visual contexts and generalizing that learning to same category members. The method uses head-mounted eye-trackers to capture field-of-view images from 100 infants 17 to 22 months of age as they spontaneously interact and play with objects. Through active interactions with objects infants generates their own packets of visual data for learning. Multiple visual properties relevant to object perception will be algorithmically measured and quantified. Toddlers’ recognition of the actively-engaged object and a novel object from the same category will be measured in challenging benchmark contexts including clutter, occlusion, and different views. Category generalization will be measured in a name generalization task. Advanced statistics and machine learning will determine the visual properties of self-generated experiences that support infants object recognition and categorization. The research will provide the first characterization of the natural visual statistics of toddlers’ active interactions with objects and potentially transformative evidence that the developmental foundation for human prowess in visual object categorization lies not in experiences with many different instances of a single category, the standard assumption, but in active visual experiences with individual objects. Moreover, infants at risk for Developmental Language Delay and Autism show disruptions in early object name learning that have been recently linked to disruptions in visual learning about objects. The project includes preliminary analyses of infants at risk in preparation for the next step in the long-term research program. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because visual object recognition and learning is implicated in broad array of cognitive tasks in early the learning of first words, reading and learning the symbol systems of mathematic; the continued risks of children treated for amblyopia and strabismus in perceptual, cognitive and school achievements and the nexus of disrupted visual learning and lexical development in children with Developmental Language Delay and Autism. Understanding infants self-generated active visual experiences is expected to give rise to new diagnostics and behavioral interventions for at-risk infants.

A limiting factor that affects all device types are perceptual distortions and subsequent loss of information, caused by interactions between the implant technology and the underlying neurophysiology. Understanding the causes of these distortions and finding ways to alleviate them is critically important to the success of current and future sight restoration technologies. In this proposal, human visual psychophysics, computational modeling, data-driven approaches, and virtual reality (VR) will be combined to develop and experimentally validate optimized stimulation protocols for epiretinal prostheses. This approach is analogous to virtual prototyping for airplanes and other complex systems: to use a high-quality model of both the implant electronics and the visual system in order to generate a ‘virtual patient’. Retinal electrophysiological and visual behavioral data will be used to develop and validate a computational model of the expected visual experience of patients when electrically stimulated. One way of using this model will be to generate simulations of the expected perceptual outcome of electrical stimulation across a wide variety of electrical stimulation patterns. These will be used as a training set for machine learning algorithms that will invert the input-output function of the model to find the electrical stimulation protocol that best replicates any desired perceptual experience. The model can also be used to simulate the expected perceptual experience of real patients by using sighted subjects in a VR environment – ‘VR virtual patients’. These virtual patients will be used to discover preprocessing methods (e.g., edge enhancement, retargeting, decluttering) that improve behavioral performance in VR. Although current retinal prostheses have been implanted in over 250 patients worldwide, experimentation with improved stimulation protocols remains challenging and expensive. Implementing ‘virtual patients’ in VR offers an affordable and practical alternative for high-throughput experiments to test new stimulation protocols. Stimulation protocols that result in good VR performance will be experimentally validated in real prosthesis patients in collaboration with Second Sight Medical Products Inc. and Pixium Vision, two leading device manufacturers in the field. This work has the potential to significantly improve the effectiveness of visual neuroprostheses as a treatment option for individuals suffering from blinding retinal diseases. Project Narrative Inadequate stimulation paradigms are currently one of the main factors limiting the effectiveness of visual prostheses as a treatment option for individuals suffering from blinding retinal diseases. My goal is to develop and validate novel stimulation protocols for visual prosthesis patients that minimize perceptual distortions and thereby improve behavioral performance. Developing methods for generating better stimulation protocols through a combination of behavioral testing, virtual reality, computational modeling, and machine learning, has the potential to provide a transformative improvement of this device technology.",Virtual prototyping for retinal prosthesis patients,10248573,R00EY029329,"['Affect ', ' Bionics ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cochlear Implants ', ' Cochlear Prosthesis ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Electric Stimulation ', ' Electrical Stimulation ', ' electrostimulation ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electronics ', ' electronic device ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye Movements ', ' Ocular Prosthesis ', ' Artificial Eye ', ' eye prosthesis ', ' prosthetic vision ', ' vision prosthesis ', ' visual prosthesis ', ' visual prosthetic ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Learning ', ' Macular degeneration ', ' Macular degenerative disease ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Patients ', ' Perceptual distortions ', ' Photoreceptors ', ' Photoreceptor Cell ', ' Photosensitive Cell ', ' Visual Receptor ', ' Prosthesis Design ', ' prosthetic design ', ' Psychophysics ', ' psychophysical ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Retina ', ' Retinal Diseases ', ' Retinal Disorder ', ' retina disease ', ' retina disorder ', ' retinopathy ', ' Retinitis Pigmentosa ', ' Pigmentary Retinopathy ', ' Tapetoretinal Degeneration ', ' rod-cone dystrophy ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual impairment ', ' Diminished Vision ', ' Low Vision ', ' Partial Sight ', ' Reduced Vision ', ' Subnormal Vision ', ' vision impairment ', ' visually impaired ', ' Work ', ' Schedule ', ' Specialist ', ' Prosthesis ', ' Prosthetic device ', ' Prosthetics ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Compensation ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' gaze ', ' Visual System ', ' Visual system structure ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' object recognition ', ' neuro-prosthetic ', ' neuroprosthetic ', ' neuroprosthesis ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' behavioral test ', ' behavior test ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Retinal Dystrophy ', ' Modeling ', ' virtual reality ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Data ', ' Visual Psychophysics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' virtual ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Implant ', ' implantation ', ' prototype ', ' retinal prosthesis ', ' artificial retina ', ' prosthetic retina ', ' retinal prosthetic ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' optogenetics ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' regression algorithm ', ' virtual reality environment ', ' immersive digital environment ', ' immersive environment ', ' immersive virtual environment ', ' immersive virtual reality ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Visualization ', ' sight restoration ', ' restore sight ', ' restore vision ', ' vision restoration ', ' virtual patient ', ' ']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA BARBARA,R00,2021,236458,CA-24
"CRCNS: Probabilistic models of perceptual grouping/segmentation in natural vision   To understand and navigate the environment, sensory systems must solve simultaneously two competing and challenging tasks: the segmentation of a sensory scene into individual objects and the grouping of elementary sensory features to build these objects. Understanding perceptual grouping and segmentation is therefore a major goal of sensory neuroscience, and it is central to advancing artificial perceptual systems that can help restore impaired vision. To make progress in understanding image segmentation and improving algorithms, this project combines two key components. First, a new experimental paradigm that allows for well-controlled measurements of perceptual segmentation of natural images. This addresses a major limitation of existing data that are either restricted to artificial stimuli, or, for natural images, rely on manual labeling and conflate perceptual, motor, and cognitive factors. Second, this project involves developing and testing a computational framework that accommodates bottom-up information about image statistics and top-down information about objects and behavioral goals. This is in contrast with the paradigmatic view of visual processing as a feedforward cascade of feature detectors, that has long dominated computer vision algorithms and our understanding of visual processing. The proposed approach builds instead on the influential theory that perception requires probabilistic inference to extract meaning from ambiguous sensory inputs. Segmentation is a prime example of inference on ambiguous inputs: the pixels of an image often cannot be labeled with certainty as grouped or segmented. This project will test the hypothesis that human visual segmentation is a process of hierarchical probabilistic inference. Specific Aim 1 will determine whether the measured variability of human segmentations reflects the uncertainty predicted by the model, as required for well-calibrated probabilistic inference. Specific Aim 2 addresses how feedforward and feedback processing in human segmentation contribute to efficient integration of visual features across different levels of complexity, from small contours to object parts. Specific Aim 3 will determine reciprocal interactions between perceptual segmentation and top-down influences including: semantic scene content; visual texture discrimination; and expectations reflecting environmental statistics. The proposed approach models these influences as Bayesian priors, and thus, if supported by the proposed experiments, will offer a unified framework to understand the integration of bottom-up and top- down influences in human segmentation of natural inputs. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This project aims to provide a unified understanding of perceptual segmentation and grouping of visual inputs encountered in the natural environment, through correct integration of the information contained in the visual inputs with top-down information about objects and behavioral goals. This understanding is central to advancing artificial perceptual systems that can help restore impaired vision in patient populations.

"Mechanisms of attentional control: Structure and dynamics from simultaneous EEG-fMRI and machine learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Selective attention is an essential cognitive ability that permits us to effectively process and act upon relevant information while ignoring distracting events. A network involving frontal and parietal cortex for top-down attentional control, referred to as the Dorsal Attention Network (DAN), is active during both spatial and non- spatial (feature-based) attention. However, we know very little about the fine structure of attentional control activity in the DAN, how this structure changes to represent different to-be-attended stimulus features, how the connectivity within the DAN, and between the DAN and sensory cortex shifts when attending different features, or how these top-down processes and their influence in sensory cortex unfold over time. This gap in our knowledge is a critical problem for our models and theories of attention, and because attentional deficits are involved in a wide variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, attention deficit disorder, dementia, and schizophrenia. The working model guiding this research is that top-down attentional control, based on different to-be-attended stimulus attributes, is guided by a smaller-scale neural fine structure within the DAN and prefrontal cortex that makes specific connections with specialized areas of visual cortex coding the attended attributes. Moreover, the time course of activity within the DAN in relation to that in sensory cortex follows a top-down cascading model, being earliest in frontal, then parietal cortex, and finally sensory cortex for preparatory, voluntary, attentional control. To identify the functional networks for attentional control for different forms of attention, and to define their time courses, this project uses innovative simultaneous recording of electroencephalographic (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Advanced signal processing and modeling, including multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), graph theoretic connectivity analysis, and Granger causality analysis will be used to reveal the fine functional anatomy and time course of attentional control and selection. The project includes three experiments that vary the to-be-attended stimulus attributes from spatial location to stimulus features (color and motion), and pursues three aims. Aim 1 is to reveal the fine structure of top-down preparatory attentional control for different to-be-attended stimulus features. Aim 2 is to elucidate the specific connectivity between fine structures for preparatory attentional control in the DAN and their target sensory structures in sensory cortex. Aim 3 is to reveal the time course of top-down attentional control for different to-be-attended stimulus attributes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The capacity to focus attention is at the core of human mental functioning, and therefore, elucidating the neural bases of attention remains a central challenge for neuroscience, representing an essential aim in translational efforts to ameliorate attentional deficits in a wide variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, attention deficit disorder, dementia, and schizophrenia.",Mechanisms of attentional control: Structure and dynamics from simultaneous EEG-fMRI and machine learning,10115818,R01MH117991,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Attention ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Color ', ' Cues ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' frontal lobe ', ' frontal cortex ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Motion ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Perception ', ' Research ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Attention Deficit Disorder ', ' Visual Cortex ', ' visual cortical ', ' Work ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' Dorsal ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' selective attention ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Inferior ', ' sensory cortex ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' Graph ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' data integration ', ' Attentional deficit ', ' extrastriate visual cortex ', ' extrastriate area ', ' extrastriate cortex ', ' visual area ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' signal processing ', ' cognitive ability ', ' attentional control ', ' mental function ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2021,530307,CA-03
"Elucidating novel features of visual processing and physiological connectivity from retina to primary visual cortex Project Summary The use of stimuli with increasingly naturalistic properties has become critical to advance our understanding of vision. Many studies demonstrate that simple artificial stimuli (e.g. sinusoidal gratings and white noise) fail to engage nonlinearities that profoundly alter responses in the retina, lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), and primary visual cortex (V1). A recent and striking example comes from the use of naturalistic ‘flow’ stimuli, which engage robust responses in V1 that are not predicted from responses to gratings. This gap in understanding motivates the development of a stimulus ensemble and analysis framework that produces a quantitative understanding of visual processing to increasingly naturalistic stimuli and the nonlinearities that they engage. Our objective is to understand how flow stimuli are processed from retina through visual cortex. To meet this goal, we will make neural population recordings in retina (Aims 1 & 3), LGN (Aims 1 & 3) and V1 (Aim 3) using matched experimental conditions and a unified theoretical/modeling framework to map the transformations that occur across these stages of visual processing. Our central hypothesis is that V1 transforms a discrete and heavily light-level-de- pendent retinal representation of natural stimuli into a continuous (uniform) representation that is relatively in- variant to changes in the mean luminance. This invariance places a strong constraint on the class of nonlineari- ties that transform retinal responses to those observed in LGN and V1. We test this hypothesis in three aims: (1) determine early visual processing (retina & LGN) of naturalistic flow stimuli; (2) develop an encoding manifold to capture the population activity at each processing stage and transforms from one stage to the next; (3) test the ability of the manifold description to predict the impact of light adaptation on processing flow stimuli from retina to V1. Aim 1 will yield a matched experimental dataset to an interesting and novel class of ecologically-relevant stimuli. Aim 2 will yield a quantitative framework by which to understand the transformations that occur between retina, LGN, and V1. Aim 3 will provide a platform for globally perturbing the output of the retina by switching from photopic to mesopic and scotopic conditions, and thereby compare predictions of our model to measured changes in LGN and V1 activity. The primary significance of this research is that it will provide a computationally and experimentally unified framework for understanding the transformations that occur in the processing of stim- uli across multiple stages of visual processing. The major innovations are (1) presenting visual stimuli for retinal recordings that are matched to eye movements and pupil dynamics in alert animals; (2) creating a novel analysis framework that captures the responses of neurons at all three levels and the inter-level transformations to in- creasingly complex stimuli; (3) utilizing light adaptation as a method of perturbing retinal output to test our model and the stability (invariance) of LGN and V1 responses to adapting retinal signals. The expected outcome is a data-driven model of the processing from retina to LGN and V1 that generalizes from starlight to sunlight. Project Narrative Restoring vision to the blind likely requires understanding how retinal signals are communicated to the brain and how these signals are transformed in the thalamocortical pathway.

"Causal role of higher-order thalamo-cortical oscillations in sustained attention PROPOSAL SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Sustained attention – the continuous allocation of cognitive resources to respond to infrequent but behaviorally relevant stimuli – is impaired in many psychiatric disorders and represents an important aspect of cognitive control. Sustained attention requires top-down control and engagement with the external world, which is linked to both frontoparietal and thalamic controlling signals on primary sensor cortices. Despite the extensive behavioral characterization of sustained attention in animal models using the five-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT), very little is known about the oscillatory interaction between the dorsal attention network and thalamo-cortical dynamics and its potential as a stimulation target for enhancing sustained attention. The objective of this project is to dissect the causal role of higher-order thalamo-cortical oscillations in sustained attention via temporally-precise rhythmic stimulation. I will focus on three regions in the visual thalamo-cortical network: higher-order visual thalamus (lateral aspect of lateral posterior nucleus, LPl), posterior parietal cortex (PPC), and primary visual cortex (V1). I will test the central hypothesis that LPl-cortical theta (4-7 Hz) functional connectivity causally coordinates PPC-V1 functional connectivity to facilitate sustained attention. The rationale of this work is that the proposed temporally-precise rhythmic optogenetic perturbations will directly test the causal role of thalamo-cortical functional connectivity in sustained attention. Accordingly, the two specific aims are: (1) Delineate the functional role of higher-order thalamo-cortical oscillations in sustained attention, (2) Determine the causal role of thalamo-cortical functional connectivity in sustained attention via temporally-precise rhythmic optogenetics. This work is significant because it will causally test a convergent model in which higher-order visual thalamus coordinates the parietal top-down control signals onto visual cortex that is crucial for developing circuit- based therapies to enhance sustained attention. The work is innovative due to its integration of closed-loop optogenetics circuit interrogation, multisite electrophysiology, freely-moving sustained attention task, and machine-learning tools for the investigation of the causal role of oscillatory synchronization. The overall positive impact of the proposed study is to provide a more comprehensive map of how the higher-order visual thalamus interacts with the frontoparietal control signal to modulate V1, and thus mediates sustained attention, a transdiagnostic cognitive function that shows impairment in many psychiatric disorders including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. The implication of this study is that it may reveal a general mechanism underlying the interaction between two higher-order processing structures signaling to lower sensory cortices during cognitive processing. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sustained attention enables us to focus our cognitive resources on an activity for a prolonged period of time, and when impaired causes profound deficits in both cognition and behavior. Sustained attention is modulated by the thalamo-cortical rhythms. The research generated in this proposal will investigate (1) what oscillatory feature in the higher-order thalamo-cortical circuit is crucial for sustained attention, and (2) how the temporally- precise enhancing or disrupting of a thalamo-cortical oscillatory feature alters the functional connectivity in the circuit and behavioral outcomes mediated by sustained attention.",Causal role of higher-order thalamo-cortical oscillations in sustained attention,10199754,F31MH118799,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' Cognition ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Couples ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Exhibits ', ' Ferrets ', ' Foundations ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Microelectrodes ', ' Miniaturized Electrodes ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Reaction Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Response Time ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' area striata ', ' Primary visual cortex ', ' Striate Cortex ', ' Striate area ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Time ', ' Visual Cortex ', ' visual cortical ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Lateral ', ' Dorsal ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Lateral posterior nucleus of thalamus ', ' Lateral Posterior Nucleus ', ' Lateral Posterior Thalamic Nucleus ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II ', ' CaM KII ', ' CaM PK II ', ' CaM kinase II ', ' CaMKII ', ' calcium-dependent CaM kinase II ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' cognitive function ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Parietal ', ' Techniques ', ' Performance ', ' sensory cortex ', ' visual stimulus ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' axon signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neurotransmission ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' novel ', ' Touch ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch sensation ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' AD/HD ', ' ADHD ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Attentional deficit ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' Implant ', ' cognitive control ', ' optogenetics ', ' signal processing ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' sustained attention ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,F31,2021,40048,NC-04
"Function of high-level visual cortex in awake infants. Project Summary Functional magnetic resonance imagining (fMRI) has revealed two major principles of the functional organization of the ventral temporal cortex (VTC) in human adults. First, some regions of VTC respond selectively to a specific category of stimuli, such as the fusiform face area (FFA) which responds more to faces than to any other stimulus category. The second principle of organization is that different categories of stimuli have systematically distinct patterns of response across the entire VTC. How do these two key aspects of VTC functional organization in adults arise in development? The goal of my research program is to discover if these organizing principles are present in the infant brain (Aims 1 and 2) and design computational models to test different theories of cortical development (Aim 3). The dissertation work in this proposal will provide invaluable data toward the goal of refining theories of cortical development. In addition to innovations that enhance the quality of awake infant fMRI data, Aim 1 provides the first evidence that like adults, infants have face-selective responses in the FFA, scene-selective responses in the parahippocampal place area (PPA), and body-selective responses in the extrastriate body area (EBA). Aim 2 directly follows this up by asking if infants have systematically distinct patterns of response across higher- level visual areas that are similar to those found in the adult brain. The F99 phase of this proposal will provide training to optimize machine learning (ML) techniques that can withstand the unique challenges of infant fMRI data – specifically unbalanced and missing data. The F99 phase will be conducted at MIT, an intellectual environment with access to leaders in the fields of ML, cognitive neuroscience, and computational neuroscience. Finally, Aim 3 of this proposal is to build computational models designed to test current theories of cortical development. The K00 phase of this proposal will provide training on the design and implementation of artificial neural networks (ANNs) models as well as training on the best methods to test ANN models using infant fMRI data. Research for the K00 phase will provide a new mentorship experience with an established investigator in computational neuroscience and will take place at an institution with a thriving intellectual environment that has access to an MRI scanner and the computational resources necessary to build a variety of ANN models. In summary, the objective of the proposed research is to determine if the principles of functional organization in the adult brain are present in infants. Insights from this proposal will advance and refine theories of cortical development and have the potential to be applicable to other domains such audition and language. Further, by combining my predoctoral training in awake infant fMRI with my proposed postdoctoral training in computational modeling, the proposed research will enable me to become an independent investigator and leader in the field of computational developmental neuroscience. Project Narrative The last 20 years of cognitive neuroscience has revealed the functional architecture of the human brain with an exquisite degree of detail yet has left wide-open the question of what guides the precise development, organization, and structure of the human mind.

"Vision in Natural Tasks Summary/Abstract  In the context of natural behavior, humans make continuous sequences of sensory-motor decisions to satisfy current behavioral goals, and vision must provide the information needed to achieve those goals. The proposed work examines gaze and walking decisions in locomotion in outdoor environments, taking advantage of our novel system for measuring combined eye and body movements in these contexts. Currently we have only limited understanding of the constituent tasks in natural locomotion, or the requisite information, and the proposal attempts to specify these.  in the context of natural gait, the patterns of optic flow are unexpectedly complex, raising questions about its role. The patterns of motion on the retina during locomotion depend critically on both eye and body motion, and these in turn depend on behavioral goals. Our first Aim is therefore to comprehensively describe the statistics of retinal motion patterns in a variety of terrains and task contexts. We will measure binocular eye and body movements while walking in outdoor terrains of varying roughness, crossing a busy intersection, and making coffee. These contexts will induce different gaze patterns. We will provide a comprehensive description of the motion stimulus in natural locomotion and help separate out self-motion signals from externally generated motion. These data will allow a more precise specification of the response patterns in cortical motion sensitive areas. Because of the complexity of natural motion patterns, we will re-examine the influence of optic flow on walking direction in a virtual reality environment and test alternative explanations for the role of flow.  A central task in walking is foot placement, and we will focus on identifying the image properties that make a good foothold. Stereo, structure from motion, and spatial image structure are all likely contenders. We directly investigate the role of stereo in foothold selection by examining gait patterns in stereo-deficient subjects in terrains with varying degrees of roughness. Using a different strategy, we will attempt to predict gaze locations and footholds in rough terrain using convolution neural nets (CNN’s) to identify potential search templates for footholds in rough terrain. We will describe fixation patterns from crosswalk and sidewalk navigation and attempt to make inferences about their purpose, and use Modular Inverse Reinforcement Learning (MIRL) to predict direction decisions and decompose the behavior into sub-tasks.  The collection of integrated gaze, body kinematics, and scene images in a range of natural environments is innovative, as little comparable data exists The work will be strengthened by the investigation of stereo- deficient subjects for whom there is almost no integrated eye and body data. Since much of the work in robotics has no visual input at all this should help in development of visual guidance for robots and also help better define the necessary information for individuals with impaired vision. The data set will be made publicly available. Project Narrative  The central goal of this work is to understand vision in its natural context. This is very important information in order to devise suitable vision aids and rehabilitation strategies for individuals with visual impairments, and it is becoming increasingly accessible because of developments in technology for monitoring eye and body movements. The proposed work examines gaze and walking decisions in locomotion in outdoor environments, taking advantage of our novel system for measuring combined eye and body movements in these contexts. Currently we have only limited understanding of the constituent tasks and requisite information in natural locomotion, and the proposal attempts to specify these.

"Imaging Functional Connectivity in Visual Cortex The mammalian visual cortex is critical for vision and has been used as a model for the rest of the cerebral cortex. In spite of this, little is known about the detailed operations of its microcircuits. In fact, the cortex is composed of many different cell types, and, it is likely that each cell type has a particular circuit function.  In the past cycle we focused on four major subtypes of cortical GABAergic interneurons (PV, SOM, VIP and chandeliers) in mouse visual cortex, using two- photon photoactivation and transgenic mice to map connections to and from interneurons in a systematic fashion. We found that interneurons often make synaptic connections with every single neighboring cell, and this promiscuity could be an important feature of the cortical inhibitory “circuit blueprint”.  In the course of these experiments we unexpectedly discovered that groups of coactive neurons, which we termed “neuronal ensembles”, account for the majority of the cortical response to visual stimuli. Moreover, ensembles also dominate spontaneous activity and have distinct spatiotemporal characteristics. Further, using two-photon optogenetics we found by chance that ensembles can be artificially imprinted into the cortex and they can be recalled by stimulating individual neurons, showing pattern completion, even days after imprinting. These intriguing results suggest that ensembles could be multicellular building blocks of cortical function, implementing a population neural code.  To pursue this discovery and test these ideas we now propose an experimental “deep dive” into the properties of these ensembles, in order to characterize their basic phenomenology, understand their synaptic circuit mechanisms and test their role in the behavior of the animal in sensory discrimination. The project will be carried out in primary visual cortex of awake behaving mice and make use of a novel two-photon holographic microscopy method that enables us to image and optically manipulate neurons in different cortical layers simultaneously.  Our work will provide a systematic anatomical and functional description of neuronal ensembles, how they regulate the activity of the cortex and how they can be manipulated and reconfigured. This could help in novel therapeutic strategies by reconfiguring pathological circuits and correct visual deficits. Imaging Functional Connectivity in Visual Cortex The role of coordinated neuronal activity by groups of neurons in the visual cortex is still poorly understood. In the last cycle of the grant we discovered that one can reconfigure cortical activity in mouse visual cortex using optogenetics, by imprinting and recalling artificial activity patterns, and we now propose to understand how these patterns are build and whether their manipulation can lead to changes in behavior. This work could help to understand how neural circuits in the visual cortex operate and can be altered and also help to design novel strategies to ameliorate amblyopia and cortical cerebral visual impairment by reconfiguring abnormal circuits.  ",Imaging Functional Connectivity in Visual Cortex,10169447,R01EY011787,"['Amblyopia ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Animal Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cerebral cortex ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Epidemic ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' In Vitro ', ' Premature Infant ', ' infants born premature ', ' infants born prematurely ', ' premature baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' preterm baby ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm infant human ', ' nerve supply ', ' innervation ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Transgenic Mice ', ' Microscopy ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rest ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' area striata ', ' Primary visual cortex ', ' Striate Cortex ', ' Striate area ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual Cortex ', ' visual cortical ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Mediating ', ' Neocortex ', ' homotypical cortex ', ' isocortex ', ' neopallium ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' awake ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Morphology ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' photoactivation ', ' sensory discrimination ', ' visual stimulus ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' 3-D Imaging ', ' 3D imaging ', ' Three-Dimensional Imaging ', ' in vivo ', ' Optical Methods ', ' Slice ', ' Pathologic ', ' Preparation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' two-photon ', ' 2-photon ', ' excitatory neuron ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' Perceptual learning ', ' Population ', ' Synaptic plasticity ', ' imprint ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic strategies ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' developmental plasticity ', ' operation ', ' optogenetics ', ' phenomenological models ', ' phenomenology ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' neural network ', ' mouse genetics ', ' cortical visual impairment ', ' cerebral visual impairment ', ' ']",NEI,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2021,384357,NY-13
"Predicting Human Olfactory Perception from Molecular Structure PROJECT SUMMARY Modern technology makes it possible to capture a visual scene as a photograph, alter it, send it to another country nearly instantaneously, and store it without concern for degradation. None of this is currently possible in olfaction. Although perfumers and flavorists are adept at mixing odorous molecules to produce a desired perceptual effect, the rules underlying this process are poorly understood at a quantitative level. Current methods for displaying odors to a subject are akin to requiring a Polaroid of every visual stimulus of interest. A more efficient method for probing the olfactory system would be to use a set of 'primary odors'—some limited number of odors from which all other complex odors could be reproduced by appropriate mixtures. Both auditory and visual stimuli have been digitized, and this will eventually be possible in olfaction as well. Predicting odor from chemical structure has been a problem in the field since its inception, but recent advances in machine learning algorithms have made great progress in analogous problems, such as facial recognition. The research proposed here will combine these machine learning techniques with high quality human psychophysics to understand how to predict the smell of a molecule or mixture of odorants, which will ultimately help improve our understanding of disease diagnosis using odors as well as eating-related health and illness. HEALTH RELEVANCE The sense of smell plays a critical role in preferences and aversions for specific foods. The proposed research will combine machine learning techniques with high quality human psychophysics to create a model that can predict the smell of odorous molecules. This model will allow us to describe and control odors, which will increase our understanding of food preference and eating-related health and wellness.",Predicting Human Olfactory Perception from Molecular Structure,10249061,R01DC017757,"['Algorithms ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food Preferences ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Ligands ', ' Mass Fragmentography ', ' GC MS ', ' GCMS ', ' Gas-Liquid-Mass Spectrometry Chromatography ', ' Mass Fragmentographies ', ' Mass-Gas Chromatography Spectrometry ', ' Mass-Gas Chromatography Spectrum Analysis ', ' ion trap mass spectrometry ', ' mass fragmentometry ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Molecular Structure ', ' Macromolecular Structure ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Odors ', ' Olfactory Pathways ', ' Olfactory system ', ' olfactory circuitry ', ' olfactory circuits ', ' Perception ', ' Play ', ' Psychophysics ', ' psychophysical ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Smell Perception ', ' Olfaction ', ' Smell ', ' odor perception ', ' olfactory perception ', ' Technology ', ' Translating ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' auditory stimulus ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Non-linear Models ', ' Nonlinear Models ', ' Chemicals ', ' Chemical Structure ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' Measurement ', ' Descriptor ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' physical property ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' visual stimulus ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' single molecule ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Collection ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Numerical value ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' computer monitor ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' high dimensionality ', ' predictive test ', ' predictive assay ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' in silico ', ' ']",NIDCD,MONELL CHEMICAL SENSES CENTER,R01,2021,437424,PA-03
"Guiding Attention in Real-World Scenes Project Summary Real-world scenes contain far more information than we can perceive at any given moment. Scene perception therefore requires attentional selection of relevant scene regions for prioritized processing. How are those aspects of the world that should receive priority selected? Although much past research has focused on how attention is guided by the visual properties of a scene, new evidence from meaning maps, developed in the previous funding period, established that the distribution of meaning across a scene plays a central and often dominant role in guiding attention. This surprising finding raises many important new questions about the nature of scene meaning and its specific role in attentional guidance. The overarching goal of this project is to understand in detail how the semantic features of a scene’s objects and functional spaces influence the guidance of visual attention in complex real-world scenes. The specific aims are: (1) To determine the role of object semantics in attentional guidance in scenes; (2) To determine the role of functional spaces in attentional guidance in scenes; (3) To determine how viewing task interacts with scene semantics in guiding attention. The project is innovative in expanding the traditional study of attention to explicitly consider the role of meaning. To this end, new semantic maps capitalizing on the meaning map concept will be used capture local region meaning continuously over a scene, allowing for direct investigation of the relationships of different types of meaning with attention. The project is innovative in (1) expanding the traditional study of visual attention to explicitly consider the role of semantics; (2) focusing on the semantics of both scene content (objects) and scene structure (space); (3) considering the role of meaning in attentional guidance in the context of viewing task; (4) integrating the use of a wide variety of cognitive science methods marshalled in the service of understanding the influence of meaning on visual attention in real-world scenes, including eyetracking, large-scale crowd-sourcing, computational image processing, computational semantic modeling, and deep convolutional neural networks. The project is significant in challenging current models of visual attention to account for the role of scene meaning. Because the proposed studies test competing models, the results will lead to the development of integrative theoretical frameworks that advance the field regardless of the outcome. While focused on basic science, the studies have potentially important translational implications by providing a more complete characterization of the processes associated with visual attention. The proposed studies may ultimately lead to the development of rehabilitation strategies for visual attention as it operates in the real world, better capitalizing on the use of a viewer’s knowledge to offset disrupted functions in those with attention and vision deficits. Project Narrative The visual world presents us with far more information than we can process at any given moment. How does the brain select those aspects of the world that should receive priority for visual analysis? This project investigates how we select and attend to meaningful information the natural environment given what we are currently trying to accomplish. The studies combine high-resolution eyetracking with models of meaning based on crowd-sourced human ratings, computer vision models of image processing, deep learning models of scene recognition and attention, and hybrid artificial intelligence models of complex concepts. The role of meaning in guiding attention is contrasted with the role of pre-semantic image features. The knowledge gained will increase our theoretical understanding of how visual attention and perception operate in complex meaningful scenes, assist in the identification of individuals with deficits in visual attention, and may ultimately lead to the development of targeted rehabilitation strategies for the real world.",Guiding Attention in Real-World Scenes,10250349,R01EY027792,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Attention ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cognition ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Environment ', ' Esthetics ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybrids ', ' Judgment ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Perception ', ' Play ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Semantics ', ' Spatial Distribution ', ' Testing ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual Perception ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Evaluation ', ' grasp ', ' Grips ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Nature ', ' cognitive psychology ', ' Cognitive Science ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Marshal ', ' Services ', ' Visual attention ', ' computer imaging ', ' digital imaging ', ' Structure ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' behavioral test ', ' behavior test ', ' Modeling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Property ', ' visual search ', ' model development ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' rehabilitation strategy ', ' rehab strategy ', ' visual information ', ' concept mapping ', ' concept maps ', ' crowdsourcing ', ' crowd source ', ' crowd-sourcing ', ' crowdsource ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' imaging properties ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' ']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2021,369421,CA-03
