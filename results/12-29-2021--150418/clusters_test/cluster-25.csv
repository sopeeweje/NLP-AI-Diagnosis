"Interpretable and extendable deep learning model for biological sequence analysis and prediction Project Abstract Bioinformatics and computational biology have become the core of biomedical research. The PI Dr. Dong Xu's work in this area focuses on development of novel computational algorithms, software and information systems, as well as on broad applications of these tools and other informatics resources for diverse biological and medical problems. He works on many research problems in protein structure prediction, post-translational modification prediction, high-throughput biological data analyses, in silico studies of plants, microbes and cancers, biological information systems, and mobile App development for healthcare. He has published more than 300 papers, with about 12,000 citations and H-index of 55. In this project, the PI proposes to develop deep-learning algorithms, tools, web resources for analyses and predictions of biological sequences, including DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. The availability of these data provides emerging opportunities for precision medicine and other areas, while deep learning as a cutting-edge technology in machine learning, presents a new powerful method for analyses and predictions of biological sequences. With rapidly accumulating sequence data and fast development of deep-learning methods, there is an urgent need to systematically investigate how to best apply deep learning in sequence analyses and predictions. For this purpose, the PI will develop cutting-edge deep-learning methods with the following goals for the next five years:  (1) Develop a series of novel deep-learning methods and models to specifically target biological sequence analyses and predictions in: (a) general unsupervised representations of DNA/RNA, protein and SNP/mutation sequences that capture both local and global features for various applications; (b) methods to make deep-learning models interpretable for understanding biological mechanisms and generating hypotheses; (c) “rule learning”, which abstracts the underlying “rules” by combining unsupervised learning of large unlabeled data and supervised learning of small labeled data so that it can classify new unlabeled data.  (2) Apply the proposed deep-learning model to DNA/RNA sequence annotation, genotype-phenotype analyses, cancer mutation analyses, protein function/structure prediction, protein localization prediction, and protein post-translational modification prediction. The PI will exploit particular properties associated with each of these problems to improve the deep-learning models. He will develop a set of related prediction and analysis tools, which will improve the state-of-art performance and shed some light on related biological mechanisms.  (3) Make the data, models, and tools freely accessible to the research community. The system will be designed modular and open-source, available through GitHub. They will be available like integrated circuit modules, which are universal and ready to plug in for different applications. The PI will develop a web resource for biological sequence representations, analyses, and predictions, as well as tutorials to help biologists with no computational knowledge to apply deep learning to their specific research problems. Relevance to Public Health Biological sequences, including DNA, RNA and protein sequences, represent the largest sources of growing big data in current biology and medicine, which provide tremendous opportunities for precision medicine, synthetic biology, and other areas. Deep learning as an emerging machine-learning method has a great potential in utilizing these data in biomedical research. This project will develop and apply cutting-edge deep- learning methods to deliver various sequence-based computational tools for gaining new knowledge, accelerating drug development, and improving personalized diagnosis and treatment.",Interpretable and extendable deep learning model for biological sequence analysis and prediction,10145719,R35GM126985,"['Amino Acid Sequence ', ' Primary Protein Structure ', ' protein sequence ', ' Base Sequence ', ' Nucleotide Sequence ', ' nucleic acid sequence ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' indexing ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Paper ', ' Phenotype ', ' Plants ', ' Post-Translational Protein Processing ', ' Post-Translational Modification Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Post-Translational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Protein Modification ', ' Posttranslational Modifications ', ' Posttranslational Protein Processing ', ' Protein Modification ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Technology ', ' Work ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' RNA Sequences ', ' Sequence Analysis ', ' SEQ-AN ', ' Sequence Analyses ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' computer biology ', ' Computational Biology ', ' Knowledge ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Performance ', ' protein structure function ', ' novel ', ' Mutation Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' drug development ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Data ', ' Resource Informatics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' protein structure prediction ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' software systems ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Microbe ', ' synthetic biology ', ' Plug-in ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' open source ', ' Algorithmic Software ', ' Algorithmic Tools ', ' Software Algorithm ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile device application ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized diagnostics ', ' personalized diagnosis ', ' precise diagnostics ', ' precision diagnostics ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' online resource ', ' internet resource ', ' on-line compendium ', ' on-line resource ', ' online compendium ', ' web resource ', ' web-based resource ', ' deep learning ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' in silico ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R35,2021,378183,MO-04
"Advanced diffusion MRI for evaluating early response to radiation treatment in cervical cancer Project Summary Despite the advent of aggressive cervical cancer screening programs, cervical cancer remains one of the most common cancers affecting women under age 35, and the fourth most common cause of cancer death worldwide. The standard of care for early stage (≥IB) cervical cancer is hysterectomy or radiation. Unfortunately, the consequences of radical treatment include fertility loss, nerve injury causing bladder and bowel dysfunction, and pelvic pain. There is a critical need to reduce cervical cancer mortality, while minimizing the potential morbidities of treatment. To achieve this end requires refined approaches for diagnosis and evaluation of response to treatment using noninvasive biomarkers to differentiate indolent from clinically significant disease at the earliest possible time-point. PET/CT is currently the mainstay in evaluating response to treatment and is highly confounded by post-treatment changes such as edema. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with advanced diffusion-weighted imaging may offer an alternative approach to evaluate treatment response, with additional advantages of being a radiation-free and contrast media-free exam. The overall objective in this application is to develop and evaluate a robust advanced diffusion-weighted imaging technique that provides a highly sensitive and specific reflection of cervical cancer tumor burden and treatment response at the earliest possible time point. Our hypothesis is that restriction spectrum imaging (RSI), an advanced diffusion imaging technique, is as sensitive and specific as standard of care post-treatment PET/CT for evaluation of treatment efficacy of cervical cancer and can be performed 3 months earlier than standard of care PET/CT. The aims of this proposal are 1) Determine the RSI model for cervical cancer evaluation, 2) Develop and validate a cervical cancer classification algorithm from multi-parametric MRI based on the Aim 1 biophysical model using established machine learning techniques, 3) Prospectively validate RSI-MRI compared to PET/CT in evaluating response to radiation treatment in cervical cancer patients (≥ stage IB) in a pilot study0. The main significance of this study is the development of a radiation-free and non-contrast imaging technique for evaluating response to treatment three months earlier than the current standard of care PET/CT. This will allow appropriate treatment earlier preventing unnecessary progression of disease. The innovation proposed involves developing a diffusion model specific for cervix imaging within the RSI framework based on the biophysical characteristics of healthy and malignant cervical tissue. We will then apply this quantitative technique prospectively on a preliminary cohort of patients before and after treatment and compare to the standard of care PET/CT imaging. At the completion of the study, a new tool for evaluating response to treatment in cervical cancer that is contrast and radiation free will be available. This is directly translatable to the clinical setting to benefit cervical cancer patients. Cervical cancer patients will be better served, particularly patients not responding to treatment, as they can be directed to appropriate treatment at an earlier time point. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because cervical cancer is a common cause of cancer amongst women and treatment decisions are based heavily on accurate and early imaging. By developing a technique that evaluates response to treatment earlier than the current standard of care, we will decrease morbidity and mortality by treating cervical cancer at an earlier time point, preventing further progression of disease. The development of new biomedical imaging techniques to fundamentally improve the detection and treatment of disease is directly relevant to one of the key missions of the NIH.",Advanced diffusion MRI for evaluating early response to radiation treatment in cervical cancer,10121726,R37CA249659,"['Affect ', ' Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Bladder ', ' Bladder Urinary System ', ' urinary bladder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervix Uteri ', ' Cervix ', ' Uterine Cervix ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Contrast Media ', ' Contrast Agent ', ' Contrast Drugs ', ' Radiopaque Media ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Edema ', ' Dropsy ', ' Hydrops ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Gold ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Hysterectomy ', ' Infertility ', ' Cannot achieve a pregnancy ', ' Difficulty conceiving ', ' fertility cessation ', ' fertility loss ', ' infertile ', ' Inflammation ', ' Intestines ', ' Intestinal ', ' bowel ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Manuals ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity -

"Deep learning of drug sensitivity and genetic dependency of pediatric cancer cells Summary/Abstract The development of novel therapies for pediatric cancers, the second leading cause of death in children, is challenging due to the lack of comprehensive pharmacogenomics resources, unlike the well-established ones in adult cancers. However, breakthroughs in deep learning methods allow learning of intricate pharmacogenomics patterns with unprecedented performance. With a uniquely cross-disciplinary background, the candidate for this proposed K99/R00 has already, as a postdoctoral fellow, (i) developed and published several deep learning models that accurately predicted adult cancer cells’ drug sensitivity and genetic dependency using high- throughput genomics profiles, and (ii) demonstrated the feasibility of transferring the model to predict tumors by a ‘transfer learning’ design. The candidate will extend this research to study pediatric cancers and test the central hypothesis that deep learning extracts genomics signatures to predict the responses of pediatric cancer cells to chemical and genetic perturbations. The proposed study will develop novel deep learning models for predicting drug sensitivity and/or genetic dependency for (Aim 1) currently un-screened pediatric cancer cell lines by learning from screens of adult cells, and (Aim 2) pediatric tumors by learning from adult and/or pediatric cells. Prediction results will be validated by in vitro experiments and data collected from patient-derived xenografts. The proposed study is the first attempt to employ modern computational methods to advance pharmacogenomics studies of pediatric cancer, which would be difficult and costly to pursue via biological assays. Findings will shed light on the optimal drugs and novel therapeutic targets for pediatric malignancies, leading to an optimal and efficient design of preclinical tests. The candidate has a remarkable track record of bioinformatics studies of adult cancer genomics. The focus of this K99 training plan is to develop in-depth understanding of pediatric cancer and preclinical treatment models, and strengthen multifaceted components needed for a successful research career in cancer bioinformatics. The primary mentor, Dr. Peter Houghton, is a renowned leader in pediatric cancer research and preclinical drug testing programs. The candidate also has assembled an outstanding mentor team: Dr. Yidong Chen (co-mentor), a cancer genomics expert and pioneer in bioinformatics analysis of high-throughput technologies; Dr. Jinghui Zhang (collaborator), a computational biologist and leader in integrative genomics studies of major pediatric cancer genome consortiums; Dr. Yufei Huang (collaborator), an expert in state-of-the-art deep learning methods; and two highly knowledgeable consultants with relevant expertise. With this team’s guidance and structured training activities in an ideal training environment, the candidate will strengthen his skills in grant writing and lab management, teaching and mentoring, and broad connections. Overall, the K99/R00 award will be an indispensable support for a timely transition of the candidate to a successful career as a multifaceted, cross-disciplinary investigator in cancer bioinformatics. Narrative Pediatric cancer is the second leading cause of death in children, and genetic studies to inform new drug therapies have been challenging. The proposal will utilize deep learning bioinformatics methods to transfer well-established pharmacogenomics knowledge for adult cancers to the study of pediatric cancers. The findings will facilitate the optimal usage of existing drugs and the development of novel therapies for pediatric cancer, and will facilitate the candidate’s transition to an independent research

"Non-invasive automated wound analysis via deep learning neural networks Project Summary: Each year millions of Americans develop chronic wounds, which require advanced wound care that has been estimated to cost $50 Billion annually. However, our understanding of chronic wounds and how to treat them has been limited by a lack of established methods to objectively characterize and measure wound features. Detailed assessments of wounds in the clinic and research laboratory often occur through histological analysis of tissue biopsies. This information can provide insight into cellular migration into the wound, cellular proliferation at the edge of the wound, infection, and fibrosis. However, the collection, creation, and analysis of histology sections is inherently invasive, time-consuming, and qualitative. The goal of this proposal is to develop an image analysis pipeline that can provide automated quantitative analysis of wounds and lay the groundwork for a non- invasive real-time “optical biopsy” that can provide information identical to standard histopathology. Our central hypothesis is that artificial intelligence approaches using deep learning convolutional neural networks can be coupled with in vivo multiphoton microscopy and existing quantitative image analysis methods to achieve this goal with the same accuracy as traditional biopsies with histological staining and expert analysis. In Aim 1, we will training and validate neural networks capable of segmenting and quantifying standard wound histology based on training from three independent wound healing research labs. In Aim 2, we will adapt this network to perform segmentation and quantification of in vivo label-free multiphoton microscopy images of skin wounds to provide rapid readouts of wound organization and metabolic function. Finally in Aim 3, we will develop and validate a network capable of generating virtual histology images from our stain-free non-invasive in vivo MPM images, which can be coupled with the networks developed in Aim 1 and 2 to provide a comprehensive assessment of wound microstructure and metabolism. In the near-term, this proposal will develop a series of robust analysis tools that can be applied to existing H&E-stained or unstained skin tissue sections commonly studied by wound healing researchers. In the long-term, the combination of label-free multiphoton microscopy and machine learning-based image analysis will enable completely non-invasive wound histology that can be performed in real-time at the point of care to guide debridement and wound care. Public Health Relevance: Non-healing wounds, such as diabetic foot ulcers, have emerged as a major health concern, particularly for older adults.

"Human-like automated radiotherapy treatment planning via imitation learning PROJECT SUMMARY Radiation therapy is one of the major approaches for cancer treatment. Treatment planning, the process of designing the optimal treatment plan for each patient, is one of the most critical steps. If a treatment is poorly designed, a satisfactory outcome cannot be achieved, regardless of the quality of other treatment steps. Treatment planning in modern radiotherapy is formulated as a mathematical optimization problem defined by a set of hyperparameters. While there exists several quantifiable metrics to quantify plan quality and guide the planning process, these are simplified representations that cannot fully describe the physician’s intent. In addition, these metrics only measure plan quality from a population-based perspective, and cannot guide treatment planning to achieve the patient-specific best treatment plans. Hence, the best physician-preferred solution often sits in a gray area, only achievable by an extensive trial-and-error hyperparameter tuning process and interactions between the planner and physician. Consequently, planning time can take up to a week for complex cases and plan quality may be poor, if the planner is inexperienced and/or under heavy time constraints. These consequences substantially deteriorate treatment outcomes, as having been clearly demonstrated in clinical studies. Recently, the advancement in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in imitation learning allows human- like decision making by observing a human expert’s actions and internally building its own decision-making system. In response to PAR-18-530, the goal of this project is to develop and translate an AI planner that mimics human experts’ behavior to generate a high quality plan. The AI planner will not replace human planners. Instead, the AI plan will be used as a starting point in the current planning process to improve plan quality and planning efficiency. The human planner’s actions on further plan improvement can feed back to the AI planner through continuous learning for its continuous evolution. We will pursue this goal using prostate cancer as the test bed through an academic-industrial partnership, jointing strong research and clinical expertise at UT Southwestern Medical Center with extensive commercial product development experience at Varian Medical Systems Inc. The following specific aims are defined. Aim 1: Model and algorithm development. We will collect experts’ behavior data in routine treatment planning and train the AI planner. Aim 2: System validation and translation. We will integrate the AI planner into Varian Eclipse treatment planning system and validate the system in a clinically realistic setting. The innovations include the use of a state-of-the-art AI imitation learning algorithm to solve a clinically important problem, the novel technological capabilities enabled by the developed system, as well as coherent translation activities to deliver new capabilities to end users. Deliverability is ensured by extensive preliminary studies and the partnership integrating complementary expertise and resources. Clinical translation of the AI planner will bring substantial impacts to radiotherapy by providing high-quality and efficient treatment planning to benefit patients, especially those in resource-limited regions. NARRATIVE Treatment planning for radiation therapy, where an optimal treatment strategy is designed for each individual patient and executed for the whole treatment course, plays a central role for the success of radiation therapy treatment. The current treatment planning workflow is inefficient and produces plans with sub-optimal quality, substantially deteriorating treatment outcomes.

"Interpretable deep learning models for translational medicine Understanding the state of cellular signaling systems provides insights to how cells behave under physiological and pathological conditions. Cellular signaling systems are organized as hierarchy (cascade) and signals of a molecular is often compositionally encoded to control cellular processes, such as gene expression. This project aims to develop advanced deep learning models (DLMs) to simulate cellular signaling systems based on gene expression data. In last 3 years, the project has made significant progresses, but the challenges remain. Importantly, contemporary DLMs behave as “black boxes”, in that it is difficult to interpret how signals are encoded and how to interpret which signal a hidden node represent in a DLM. This black-box nature prevents researchers from gaining biological insights using DLMs, even though these models can be much superior in modeling data than other types of models in many tasks, e.g., predicting drug sensitivity of cancer cells. In this competitive renewal, we propose to develop novel DLMs and innovative inference algorithms to train “interpretable” DLMs and apply them in translational research. The proposed research is innovative and of high significance in several perspectives: 1) Our novel DLMs and algorithms take advantage of big data resulting from systematic chemical/genetic perturbations of cellular signaling machinery, so that we can use the perturbation condition as side information to reveal how signals are encoded in a DLM. 2) We integrate principles of causal inference and information theory with deep learning method to make DLMs interpretable. As results, that researchers can gain mechanistic insights from such models. 3) Innovative application of interpretable DLMs will advance translational research. For example, we will train interpretable DLMs to model cellular signaling at the level of single cells and use this information investigate inter-cellular interactions among cells in tumor microenvironment to shed light on immune evasion mechanisms of cancers. We will also use information derived from interpretable DLMs to predict cancer cell drug sensitivity. We anticipate that our study will bring forth significant advances not only in deep learning methodology but also in precision medicine. This project aims to develop advance machine learning methods, referred to as deep learning models, to simulate cellular signaling systems, at both multiple cell and single cell levels. Success of these models will enable researchers to investigate cellular behaviors under physiological and pathological condition, and such information can be used to guide therapy of cancer patients.",Interpretable deep learning models for translational medicine,10171908,R01LM012011,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Antineoplastic Agents ', ' Anti-Cancer Agents ', ' Antineoplastic Drugs ', ' Antineoplastics ', ' Cancer Drug ', ' Neoplastic Disease Chemotherapeutic Agents ', ' Tumor-Specific Treatment Agents ', ' anti-cancer drug ', ' anticancer agent ', ' anticancer drug ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunotherapy ', ' Immune mediated therapy ', ' Immunologically Directed Therapy ', ' immune therapeutic approach ', ' immune therapeutic interventions ', ' immune therapeutic regimens ', ' immune therapeutic strategy ', ' immune therapy ', ' immune-based therapies ', ' immune-based treatments ', ' immuno therapy ', ' Information Theory ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Methodology ', ' Mining ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Organoids ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Technology ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Yeasts ', ' base ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' drug sensitivity ', ' Genetic ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' Side ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer-directed therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' Micro RNA ', ' miRNA ', ' miRNAs ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' chemical genetics ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Signaling Molecule ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' tumor microenvironment ', ' cancer microenvironment ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Cancer cell line ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' transcriptomics ', ' Cell model ', ' Cellular model ', ' translational medicine ', ' Network-based ', ' cell behavior ', ' cellular behavior ', ' tumor ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' biological systems ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' TCGA ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' inquiry-based learning ', ' discovery learning ', ' inquiry-based instruction ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision oncology ', ' individualized cancer care ', ' individualized oncology ', ' personalized oncology ', ' precision cancer care ', ' precision cancer medicine ', ' deep field survey ', ' Deep Field ', ' deep field image ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' predicting response ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' translational impact ', ' Immune Evasion ', ' translational model ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' patient response ', ' patient specific response ', ' responsive patient ', ' Grain ', ' deep learning ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' learning algorithm ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,309404,PA-18
"Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT Keratoconus is a degenerative disease of the cornea that is a major cause of reduced vision-related quality of life in the United States, often leading to corneal transplantation. Ectasia after refractive surgery is a vision-threatening complication that can occur in apparently low-risk patients despite current screening technology. The biomechanical properties of the cornea play a central role in these diseases, but diagnostics are still rooted in shape measures because doctors lack direct measures of biomechanical change. While several methods have shown early promise for addressing this gap, most require contact with or perturbation of the cornea, cannot spatially resolve biomechanical properties, or involve expensive optical systems.  To address the need for direct biomechanical measurement of the cornea and the limitations of other approaches, we introduce phase-decorrelation OCT (phd-OCT). Phd-OCT makes use optical coherence tomography (OCT) to quantify random nanoscale mobility that is related to the strength and cohesion of the cornea. Preliminary results strongly support the rationale, feasibility and potential advantages of the approach. Our objectives are: (1) to refine our method to optimize detection sensitivity and speed, and (2) to determine if the technique is clinically useful. We will achieve these objectives through the following aims: 1. To develop and validate mobility-sensitive phd-OCT for corneal imaging. Spectral-domain OCT will be used for anterior segment phase-decorrelation imaging and the analysis algorithm will be optimized. The system will be validated using phantoms and torsional rheometry. 2. To investigate the potential influence of physiological factors (intraocular pressure (IOP), hydration, and temperature). Factorial design experiments in porcine and human donor globes will establish the sensitivity of phd-OCT measurements to potential confounders. 3. To develop and validate data acquisition and processing methods to enable clinical testing. GPU processing and machine learning will be configured to minimize processing time. Scan patterns will be optimized to minimize scan time and return clinically useful data. 4. To assess feasibility and preliminary diagnostic performance of clinical mobility-sensitive OCT imaging of the cornea. A first-in-human study will characterize repeatability and test the hypotheses that phd-OCT mobility measurements are increased in the region of a LASIK flap and decreased in CXL.  Expected Outcomes: The proposed studies will establish a new, non-contact method for imaging corneal biomechanical properties with the potential to address many shortcomings of current and emerging methods. Success could lead to earlier detection of of ectasia risk and allow more appropriate timing and customization of corneal treatments. Future integration of data into computational models has the potential to greatly impact the field by driving a shift from empirical planning and risk analysis to patient-specific strategies. The mechanical properties of the cornea, the transparent front of the eye, are important for diseases that affect vision as well as for corrective treatments like crosslinking therapy and LASIK. We have developed a new optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based method to detect and map corneal mechanical properties that has advantages that may make it readily translatable to clinical use. The objective of this proposal is to determine whether this technique is clinically feasible and useful by refining the technology, testing it in animal and human donor corneas, and performing studies in patients with corneal conditions of interest.",Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT,10171859,R01EY028667,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Complication ', ' Cornea ', ' corneal ', ' Corneal Diseases ', ' Corneal Disorder ', ' cornea disorder ', ' Keratoplasty ', ' Cornea Transplantation ', ' Corneal Grafting ', ' Corneal Transplantation ', ' corneal keratoplasty ', ' corneal transplant ', ' Diffusion ', ' Pathological Dilatation ', ' Ectasia ', ' Pathologic Dilatation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Exhibits ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Physiologic Intraocular Pressure ', ' Intraocular Pressure ', ' Ocular Tension ', ' intra-ocular pressure ', ' Keratoconus ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Surgical Flaps ', ' Flaps ', ' Island Flaps ', ' Family suidae ', ' Pigs ', ' Suidae ', ' Swine ', ' porcine ', ' suid ', ' Technology ', ' Temperature ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual impairment ', ' Diminished Vision ', ' Low Vision ', ' Partial Sight ', ' Reduced Vision ', ' Subnormal Vision ', ' vision impairment ', ' visually impaired ', ' Measures ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' crosslink ', ' cross-link ', ' Procedures ', ' Surgical incisions ', ' Otomy ', ' incision ', ' Anterior ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Ensure ', ' Measurement ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cohesion ', ' Proxy ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' LASIK ', ' Laser Intrastromal Keratomileuses ', ' Laser Intrastromal Keratomileusis ', ' Laser-Assisted Stromal In Situ Keratomileusis ', ' Laser In Situ Keratomileusis ', ' Property ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Torsion ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' degenerative condition ', ' degenerative disease ', ' Degenerative Disorder ', ' Hydration ', ' Hydration status ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' data integration ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' nanoscale ', ' nano meter scale ', ' nano meter sized ', ' nano scale ', ' nanometer scale ', ' nanometer sized ', ' Outcome ', ' human study ', ' data acquisition ', ' treatment effect ', ' clinical practice ', ' screening ', ' Algorithmic Analysis ', ' Algorithmic Analyses ', ' Analyses of Algorithms ', ' Analysis of Algorithms ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' mechanical properties ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' first-in-human ', ' first in man ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' detection sensitivity ', ' ']",NEI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,381543,OH-11
"Malarial Retinopathy Screening System for Improved Diagnosis of Cerebral Malaria Summary Cerebral malaria (CM) is a life-threatening clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection. Annually, malaria affects more than 200 million people and claims the lives of over 440,000 people worldwide, mostly African children. As a consequence of the high incidence of CM, it is often misdiagnosed for other pathologies with similar symptoms, leading to a high false positive rate for CM and incorrect treatment. An accurate means to confirm the presence of CM or to investigate for a non-malarial illness is critically needed to improve outcomes. Since Malarial retinopathy (MR) is greater than 90% specific and sensitive to the presence of CM once clinically diagnosed, retinal screening for MR represents an effective means to assist in and improve the specificity of CM diagnosis. VisionQuest Biomedical and its collaborators have assembled a team of inter-disciplinary scientists with considerable experience in automated retinal image analysis, clinical ophthalmology with specialized research in malarial retinopathy (MR), and cerebral malaria diagnosis (CM). This team will develop and test ASPIRE, a system for detection of MR consisting of automated MR detection software integrated with a low-cost and portable retinal camera. Our proposed ASPIRE system will augment, not replace, the current CM diagnostic standard; increasing the accuracy of CM diagnoses, leading to a smaller number of false positive outcomes. In Phases I and II, the research team at VisionQuest Biomedical developed the automated MR detection software and interfaced it with a handheld retinal camera. The resulting clinical prototype of ASPIRE was tested onsite in a health-clinic in Africa, which demonstrated excellent performance and usability for detecting MR, without the need of an ophthalmic expert. In Phase II-B, the MR detection system will be refined, productized, and the resulting commercial prototype will be validated on prospective datasets. We will accomplish this through three specific aims. In the first aim, the software system for MR detection will be adapted and improved to work with low-cost and portable iNview camera. In the second aim, we will refine iNview’s driver-software and integrate the camera with MR detection software to produce the first commercial prototype. The third aim will focus on collecting the retinal image data for algorithm testing as well as for validating the commercial prototype in an observational clinical study to be conducted at nine clinical sites in Malawi, Uganda, and Zambia in Africa. Narrative Cerebral malaria is a life-threatening clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection, which affects about 200 million people annually and claims the lives of over 440,000 people worldwide, mostly African children.

"Lagrangian computational modeling for biomedical data science The goal of the project is to develop a new mathematical and computational modeling framework for from biomedical data extracted from biomedical experiments such as voltages, spectra (e.g. mass, magnetic resonance, impedance, optical absorption, …), microscopy or radiology images, gene expression, and many others. Scientists who are looking to understand relationships between different molecular and cellular measurements are often faced with questions involving deciphering differences between different cell or organ measurements. Current approaches (e.g. feature engineering and classification, end-to-end neural networks) are often viewed as “black boxes,” given their lack of connection to any biological mechanistic effects. The approach we propose builds from the “ground up” an entirely new modeling framework build based on recently developed invertible transformation. As such, it allows for any machine learning model to be represented in original data space, allowing for not only increased accuracy in prediction, but also direct visualization and interpretation. Preliminary data including drug screening, modeling morphological changes in cancer, cardiac image reconstruction, modeling subcellular organization, and others are discussed. Mathematical data analysis algorithms have enabled great advances in technology for building predictive models from biological data which have been useful for learning about cells and organs, as well as for stratifying patient subgroups in different diseases, and other applications.

"An artificial intelligence-driven distributed stereotactic radiosurgery strategy for multiple brain metastases management PROJECT SUMMARY Brain metastases (BMs) are a life-threatening neurological disease, but current treatment regimens cannot manage multiple (>4) BMs (mBMs) without causing strong adverse effects. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), utilizing potent dose to irradiate BMs and quick dose falloff to spare nearby tissues, has proven to be an effective treatment regimen for limited-number and small-size BMs. However, SRS could not avoid high toxic dose when BMs are multiple, clustered, or adjacent to critical organs. To safe and effectively treat mBMs with SRS requires addressing these urgent needs: 1) to identify the maximum tolerable SRS dose; 2) to study neurocognitive decline and design strategies to preserve patients’ post-treatment quality of life; and 3) to develop and implement high-quality streamlined mBMs SRS treatment and follow-up care. To address mBMs SRS management needs, we aim to develop and implement an artificial intelligence (AI)- driven treatment planning system (TPS) and conduct a therapeutic intervention clinical trial, both dedicated to improve mBMs SRS treatment quality and efficiency. The AI-driven TPS, namely AimBMs, will have three AI- based computational modules, including AI-Segtor for automatic segmentation, AI-Predictor for treatment outcome prediction and AI-Planner for spatiotemporal distributed SRS plan optimization. AimBMs is initially developed based on retrospective data and facilitate the mBMs distributed SRS prospective phase I/II clinical trials, while the clinical trial will provide critical clinical knowledge and evidence as feedback to improve AimBMs performance. The ultimate goal of the project is to translate the AimBMs to routine clinical practice to improve mBMs SRS treatment quality, patients’ post-treatment QoL, and clinical facility workflow. In response to PAR-18-560, we have formed a multidisciplinary collaboration between radiation oncologists and medical physicists to develop a novel AI-driven distributed SRS technology and conduct a cancer-targeted therapeutic intervention for managing mBMs. The project’s innovations include: 1) novel SRS treatment planning technological capability enabled by AI-based auto-segmentation, treatment outcome prediction, and spatiotemporal plan optimization; 2) novel AI learning capability to improve developed AI tools’ performance through the coherent clinical trial. The technology development will support the therapeutic intervention clinical trial, while the clinical trial is designated to improve the developed system performance. This seamlessly integrated development mode ensures the developed system is clinically practical. Upon completion, our newly developed AimBMs will lay a solid foundation for mBMs SRS management and benefit a wide population of patients with BMs. Moreover, the AI-based treatment planning and treatment delivery infrastructure built for mBMs SRS can be transferred to other tumor sites to generate an even broader clinical impact.

"Novel Glaucoma Diagnostics for Structure and Function  - Renewal - 1 Project Summary Glaucoma is a leading cause of vision morbidity and blindness worldwide. Early disease detection and sensitive monitoring of progression are crucial to allow timely treatment for preservation of vision. The introduction of ocular imaging technologies significantly improves these capabilities, but in clinical practice there are still substantial challenges at certain stages of the disease severity spectrum, specifically in the early stage and in advanced disease. These difficulties are due to a variety of causes that change over the course of the disease, including large between-subject variability, inherent measurement variability, image quality, varying dynamic ranges of measurements, minimal measurable level of tissues, etc. In this proposal, we build on our long-standing contribution to ocular imaging and propose novel and sensitive means to detect glaucoma and its progression that are optimized to the various stages of disease severity. We will use information gathered from visual fields (functional information) and a leading ocular imaging technology – optical coherence tomography (OCT; structural information) to map the capability of detecting changes across the entire disease severity spectrum to identify optimal parameters for each stage of the disease. Both commonly used parameters provided by the technologies and newly developed parameters with good diagnostic potential will be analyzed. We will use state-of-the-art automated computerized machine learning methods, namely the deep learning approach, to identify structural features embedded within OCT images that are associated with glaucoma and its progression without any a priori assumptions. This will provide novel insight into structural information, and has shown very encouraging preliminary results. We will also utilize a new imaging technology, the visible light OCT, to generate retinal images with outstanding resolution to extract information about the oxygen saturation of the tissue. This will provide in-vivo, real time, and noninvasive insight into tissue functionality. Taken together, this program will advance the use of structural and functional information with a substantial impact on the clinical management of subjects with glaucoma Project Narrative This research proposal is focusing on the development and refinement of innovative analytical methods and cutting-edge technologies that will substantially improve detection of glaucoma and its progression monitoring in order to prevent blindness.",Novel Glaucoma Diagnostics for Structure and Function  - Renewal - 1,10222677,R01EY013178,"['Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Floor ', ' Future ', ' Glaucoma ', ' glaucomatous ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Maps ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Optic Disk ', ' Optic Nerve Head ', ' Optic Papilla ', ' Oxygen Consumption ', ' Pathology ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Retina ', ' Retinal Diseases ', ' Retinal Disorder ', ' retina disease ', ' retina disorder ', ' retinopathy ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Structure-Activity Relationship ', ' chemical structure function ', ' structure function relationship ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissue Extracts ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual Fields ', ' eye field ', ' Measures ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' ganglion cell ', ' gangliocyte ', ' insight ', ' Visible Radiation ', ' Visible Light ', ' Visible Light Radiation ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Metabolic ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' Width ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' Oximetry ', ' Oxygen saturation measurement ', ' innovative technologies ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' cohort ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Structure ', ' advanced illness ', ' advanced disease ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Modeling ', ' tissue oxygen saturation ', ' tissue oxygenation ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Inner Plexiform Layer ', ' Measurable ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' computerized ', ' macula ', ' macular ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' Imaging technology ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' retinal nerve fiber layer ', ' RNFL ', ' clinical practice ', ' mathematical methods ', ' math methodology ', ' math methods ', ' mathematical approach ', ' mathematical methodology ', ' mathematics approach ', ' mathematics methodology ', ' mathematics methods ', ' invention ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' preservation ', ' retinal imaging ', ' retina imaging ', ' ocular imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NEI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,666892,NY-12
"Detection and evolution of diffusely abnormal white matter in multiple sclerosis: a deep learning approach Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most widespread non-traumatic, demyelinating disorder in young adults. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) aids in both diagnosing MS and assisting clinical management of patients. In addition to focal MS lesions, diffusely abnormal white matter (DAWM) is also seen on brain MRI in MS patients. While not understood completely, DAWM is thought to be a predictor of disease burden, possibly appears early on in the disease, and may be a marker of neurodegeneration in MS. However, longitudinal studies of DAWM are lacking, and segmentation of DAWM is manual, making it difficult to study the evolution of DAWM. The main objective of this proposal is to longitudinally study the development of DAWM in MS. This objective will be realized by analyzing preexisting longitudinal MRI data acquired on 1008 MS patients who participated in phase 3, blinded, multi-center clinical trial, referred to as CombiRx that was supported by NIH. The CombiRx data includes multi-contrast MRI and various clinical measures. Automatic identification of DAWM is a critical component of this proposal. Based on our preliminary studies, deep Learning (a class of machine learning algorithms) has the potential to automatically identify DAWM and estimate its volume. We will use the large CombiRx MRI data for training, validation, and testing of the deep learning models, and to study DAWM evolution in this MS cohort. The proposal has two major aims. In the first aim we will develop a deep learning model based on fully-convolutional neural networks for automatic segmentation of DAWM, gray matter, normal appearing white matter, and T2-hyperintense lesions guided by manual segmentation of two neuroimaging experts. In the second aim we will segment DAWM and all brain tissues, including focal lesions, at baseline and all available follow-up scans in the CombiRx cohort (up to 6.5 years). The temporal changes in volume, location, and MRI parameters of DAWM and focal T2 lesions will be computed. We will finally test whether DAWM is precursor to focal T2 lesions, associated with T2 lesion resolution, or a separate disease process altogether. If DAWM is shown to occur early on in the disease, it is possible to intervene sooner for improved outcome. Similarly, if DAWM is shown to be related to disease activity, it can serve as an objective and quantitative measure of the disease. Such an objective measurement would be highly valuable in developing targeted therapies and also in evaluating the treatment effect in MS patients. The main objective of this proposal is to study the evolution of diffusely appearing white matter (DAWM) in multiple sclerosis (MS) using a novel deep learning approach. The results of this study are expected to be highly valuable in evaluating the treatment effect in individual MS patients. These results can also help reduce time and money in conducting clinical trials substantially, which would lead to early introduction of promising drugs into the market. Finally, if DAWM occurs early on in the disease, as suggested by some of the publications, it is possible to therapeutically intervene sooner for improved outcome.",Detection and evolution of diffusely abnormal white matter in multiple sclerosis: a deep learning approach,10217627,R21NS118320,"['Affect ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cerebrospinal Fluid ', ' cerebral spinal fluid ', ' spinal fluid ', ' Demyelinating Diseases ', ' Demyelinating Disorders ', ' Demyelinations ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Engineering ', ' Evolution ', ' Future ', ' Gliosis ', ' Goals ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Histology ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Multiple Sclerosis ', ' Disseminated Sclerosis ', ' insular sclerosis ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Pathologic Processes ', ' Pathological Processes ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Protons ', ' H+ element ', ' Hydrogen Ions ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Blinded ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Label ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Phase ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Therapeutic ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Attenuated ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' brain tissue ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Reporting ', ' Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis ', ' Modeling ', ' model development ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Multi-center clinical trial ', ' Multi-site clinical trial ', ' Multicenter clinical trial ', ' Multisite clinical trial ', ' Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Conduct Clinical Trials ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' Multiple Sclerosis Lesions ', ' MS Lesions ', ' axonopathy ', ' Prevalence ', ' treatment effect ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' T2 weighted imaging ', ' T2 imaging ', ' T2 weighted image ', ' multiple sclerosis patient ', ' MS patient ', ' patients with MS ', ' patients with multiple sclerosis ', ' improved outcome ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' automated segmentation ', ' auto-segmentation ', ' automatic segmentation ', ' autosegmentation ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R21,2021,234000,TX-09
"A clinical tool for automated detection and delineation of intracranial metastases from MRI As the management of multiple intracranial metastases is rapidly evolving, the demands for detection and delineation of a large number of potentially very small metastatic lesions in the brain on 3D magnetic resonance images (MRI) are increasing dramatically. Artificial intelligence (AI) systems can assist both the radiologist as well as radiation oncologist in their roles in management of patients with multiple tumors metastatic to the brain. In response to PAR-20- 155, we have assembled an academic-industrial partnership including investigators from three academic institutes and an industrial AI team to develop, translate and validate AI systems to address this unmet clinical question.

"A Fully Decentralized Federated Learning Framework for Automated Image Segmentation in Cancer Radiotherapy PROJECT SUMMARY While the recent surge of artificial intelligence (AI) has made remarkable progress in various image analysis tasks, their performance in a broad range of clinical environment is largely restricted by the limited generalization capability when being applied to new data, primarily because most models have been generated using data from a single institution or public datasets with limited training data. Aggregating data from different institutions could improve model training, but such centralized data sharing is practically challenging due to various technical, legal, privacy and data ownership barriers. This proposal aims to address these barriers by developing a novel gossip federated learning (GFL) framework to build an effective AI model by learning from different data sources without the need of sharing patient data. As compared to the traditional client/server federated learning such as FedAvg, the proposed framework is fully decentralized in that the models trained in local datasets will directly communicate to each other in a peer-to-peer manner, making our method more robust and efficient. We will develop and evaluate the proposed scheme in the task of automated organ segmentation in CT images for liver and head and neck (H&N) cancer patients treated with radiation therapy (RT) because accurate, robust and efficient delineation of those organs at risk (OARs) is a clinically important but technically challenging problem. We hypothesize that the model trained with our framework can achieve segmentation performance not inferior to a model with data pooled from all the resources. The dynamics of our recently created healthcare system mimic a diverse multi-institutional environment, which places us in an ideal setting to systematically evaluate our framework. Our specific aims include: 1) Establish the GFL-based automated OAR segmentation framework, and develop the supporting software infrastructure; 2) Optimize the GFL-based auto- segmentation; 3) Evaluate GFL-based OAR segmentation framework with 400 liver and 400 H&N cancer patients collected from four hospitals within a metropolitan health system. This proposal addresses two key research priorities for NIBIB: machine learning based segmentation and approaches that facilitate interoperability among annotations used in image training databases. The success of this project will substantially increase the number and variety of data for model training without sacrificing the patient privacy, and thus improve the performance and generalization of the segmentation model on new data. We will open-source this framework, which may enable a larger scale of multi-institutional collaboration and could expedite the clinical adoption of AI-driven auto- segmentation in RT. More importantly, this framework provides a flexible and robust solution to the primary barrier of applying AI to the medical domain where learning on multi-institutional data sharing is impeded by patient privacy concerns, and is expected to have a catalytic impact on precision medicine by generalizing it to broader applications within medicine where a model needs to learn across multi-institutional data without sacrificing patient privacy. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal aims to develop a fully decentralized federated learning framework, which allows to train a powerful artificial intelligence (AI) model by aggregating information from different institutions without sharing patient data, in order to meet the urgent needs for automated organ segmentation in cancer radiotherapy.

"An Integrated CT-based Image-Guided Neurosurgical System An Integrated CT-based Image-Guided Neurosurgical System In this SBIR Phase IIb proposal Xoran intends to commercialize a compact and affordable, yet highly- functional, system to provide real time image updates and navigation guidance in support of minimally invasive cranial and spinal neurosurgical procedures. The effort builds on previously developed compact and portable flat-panel Computed Tomography (CT) technology which has been commercialized for hard tissue applications, and incorporates work done in earlier phases of this project to generate viable high- quality images of the soft tissue structures in the brain. Intraoperatively obtained images tightly integrated into an onboard surgical navigation will provide updated instrument localization using next generation electromagnetic tool tip guidance. Workflow optimizations become possible when the imaging and guidance are one device, including fast local image updates, automatic image-to-world registration, as well as speed and simplicity of use. The project includes expansion of the system capabilities to facilitate precise minimally-invasive surgical removal of tumors in both the head and spine. It incorporates a machine-learning based deep neural network method for image finalization to allow high quality, low radiation image updates. The three-year project involves meeting technical milestones of system development including imaging capability, registration, navigation accuracy, speed, workflow, radiation dose considerations and cost. Clinical evaluations will take place at University of Michigan, and a team of consulting physicians has been assembled for oversight, input and feedback. Narrative / Relevance to Public Health Minimally invasive surgical procedures have many benefits to public health including reducing the medical risks and costs associated with brain cancer and spine surgery. However such procedures are often time consuming and technically difficult as the surgeon is unable to directly visualize the area of the operation. In this project, an intraoperative surgical system is developed with onboard imaging capability in order to enable minimally invasive surgeries to be performed more safely and completely, by providing

"Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R) Overall Project Summary  The Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R) pursues a mission of bringing people together to create new ways of seeing. The work of our Center has been focused on creating new paradigms for the acquisition, reconstruction, and interpretation of biomedical images, and on implementing new collaboration models in order to translate these developments rapidly into clinical practice.  The world of biomedical imaging is changing, and CAI2R has been at the forefront of that change. Tasks that were once the sole domain of meticulously-engineered imaging hardware are now beginning to be accomplished in software, increasingly informed by diverse arrays of inexpensive auxiliary sensors. Information once pursued through the laborious acquisition of carefully separated image datasets is now being derived from newly integrated, and richly quantitative, data streams. In keeping with these themes, our Center will be organized around the following four Technology Research and Development (TR&D) projects going forward: 1. Reimagining the Future of Scanning: Intelligent image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis. 2. Unshackling the Scanners of the Future: Flexible, self-correcting, multisensor machines. 3. Enriching the Data Stream: MRI and PET in concert. 4. Revealing Microstructure: Biophysical modeling and validation for discovery and clinical care.  In each of these projects, we aim to push medical imaging technology to the next level, both in hardware and in software. Having made great strides in developing rapid, continuous imaging data streams, we will next aim to add key new information to those streams, both from physics-driven microstructural modeling and from data- driven machine learning. Having focused on the development of robust tools for image acquisition and reconstruction, we will extend the pipeline to image interpretation, using the results of human- or machine- derived evaluations of image content as feedback for the further improvement of acquisition strategies and sensor designs. We will also aim to close the loop between diagnostic sensing and therapeutic intervention, exploring new ways to guide therapy with continuously-acquired information about tissue bioeffects.  Our Center has an explicit translational focus, which is reflected in the day-to-day operation of TR&D projects as well as in the topics of Collaborative Projects (CPs) and Service Projects (SPs), which are focused on three general areas of high public health impact: cancer, musculoskeletal disease, and neurologic disease.  In keeping with this translational emphasis, CAI2R is also be driven by an embedded collaboration model in which basic scientists, clinicians, and industry developers sit down together regularly at the scanners for interactive technology development and assessment. With early involvement of clinical stakeholders and industry partners, we aim to make CAI2R technologies widely available, for the advancement of biomedical knowledge and for the benefit of patients and the physicians who care for them. Overall Project Narrative  The Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R) develops novel imaging techniques and technologies for the improved diagnosis and management of cancer, musculoskeletal disease, neurological disease and other disorders with a profound impact on human health. By exploiting connections between imaging modalities such as MRI and PET, we aim to advance the fundamental capabilities of each, so as to expand biomedical knowledge and improve the care of patients.",Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R),10246945,P41EB017183,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Biology ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Color ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' Imagination ', ' Industry ', ' Intelligence ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Modernization ', ' Musculoskeletal Diseases ', ' musculoskeletal disorder ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patents ', ' Patients ', ' Philosophy ', ' Physicians ', ' Physics ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' PET ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET imaging ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PETT ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' Productivity ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Technology ', ' Technology Assessment ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Industrial Product ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Scanning ', ' Stream ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' Performance ', ' tech development ', ' technology development ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Modeling ', ' bio-imaging ', ' biomedical imaging ', ' bioimaging ', ' Institution ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Device ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' musculoskeletal imaging ', ' musculoskeletal scanning ', ' musculoskeletal visualization ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' reconstruction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' cancer imaging ', ' oncologic imaging ', ' oncology imaging ', ' tumor imaging ', ' Imaging technology ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' data acquisition ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' clinical care ', ' industry partner ', ' industrial partnership ', ' industry partnership ', ' clinical practice ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' operation ', ' biophysical model ', ' radio frequency ', ' radiofrequency ', ' imaging scientist ', ' imaging approach ', ' imaging based approach ', ' technology research and development ', ' technological research and development ', ' novel imaging technique ', ' data streams ', ' open source tool ', ' open source toolkit ', ' ']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,P41,2021,1174855,NY-12
"Interpretable Deep Learning Algorithms for Pathology Image Analysis Interpretable Deep Learning Algorithms for Pathology Image Analysis Abstract The microscopic examination of stained tissue is a fundamental component of biomedical research and for the understanding of biological processes of disease which leads to improved diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic response prediction. Ranging from cancer diagnosis to heart rejection and forensics the subjective interpretation of histopathology sections forms the basis of clinical decision making and research outcomes. However, it has been shown that such subjective interpretation of pathology slides suffers from large interobserver and intraobserver variability. Recent advances in computer vision and deep learning has enabled the objective and automated analysis of images. These methods have been applied with success to histology images which have demonstrated potential for development of objective image interpretation paradigms. However, significant algorithmic challenges remain to be addressed before such objective analysis of histology images can be used by clinicians and researchers. Leveraging extensive experience in developing and decimating research software based on deep learning the PI will pioneer novel algorithmic approaches to address these challenges including but not limited to: (1) training data-efficient and interpretable deep learning models with gigapixel size microscopy images for classification and segmentation using weakly supervised labels (2) fundamental redesign of data fusion paradigms for integrating information from microscopy images and molecular profiles (from multi-omics data) for improved diagnostic and prognostic determinations (3) developing visualization and interpretation software for researchers and clinical workflows to improve clinical and research validation and reproducability. The system will be designed in a modular, user-friendly manner and will be open-source, available through GitHub as universal plug-and-play modules ready to be adapted to various clinical and research applications. We will also develop a web resource with pretrained models for various organs, disease states and subtypes these will be accompanied with detailed manuals so researchers can apply deep learning to their specific research problems. Overall, the laboratory’s research will yield high impact discoveries from pathology image analysis, and its software will enable many other NIH funded laboratories to do the same, across various biomedical disciplines.

"HEALing LB3P: Profiling Biomechanical, Biological and Behavioral phenotypes ABSTRACT Chronic Low Back Pain (CLBP) is a complex multi-factorial condition, as well as the most prevalent painful musculoskeletal disorder worldwide. Identifying the optimal treatment for CLBP on a patient-specific basis is an important and unresolved challenge in medicine. Tailoring interventions according to patient movement characteristics may improve clinical outcomes. Patients with CLBP are heterogenous in terms of their symptoms, clinical exam findings, and conventional medical imaging results. For most patients, the optimal treatment plan is unknown, therefore it is challenging for the clinician to prescribe an appropriate and cost- effective course of treatment. One important clinical characteristic that can be used for classification is severity of physical impairment (problems in lumbar spine structure and function) and resulting activity limitation (difficulty executing activities). A common approach to assess the impact of physical impairment is using patient-reported outcomes (PROs), wherein patients rate their perceived ability to perform various activities in their usual environment. PROs are subjective and discrepancies have been observed between how patients score PROs and how they perform activities when observed in the clinic. It is advantageous to complement PROs with objective performance-based measures of physical function. Therefore, the overall hypothesis of the Biomechanical Core of the parent grant is that including patient-specific spine biomechanics in predictive models improves our ability to characterize CLBP patients. To that end, the purpose of this administrative supplement is to expand upon Specific Aim 2 of the Biomechanical Core, which is to characterize lumbopelvic kinematics during functional tasks and daily activities using wearable (inertial) motion sensors. Specifically, this work will aim to develop deep (machine) learning algorithms that can correctly identify and characterize motions of the lumbar spine during both clinical and field assessments. During the clinical assessments, participants will be asked to perform functional tasks while wearing inertial measurement units (IMUs). Collected data will be used to develop and train machine learning algorithms to identify tasks of interest such as activities of daily living and aberrant/painful motions. The deep learning algorithms developed will be used to label lumbar motion data collected continuously during field assessment in patients' homes over a 7-day testing period. The supplemental data will be compared with the standard data analyses approaches proposed for the overall study and included with the LB3P phenotyping. Moreover, the deep learning algorithms will serve as the foundation for the development of ecological momentary interventions that are responsive to patient's real-world functional impairments related to CLBP.

"Development of FAST-DOSE assay system for the rapid assessment of acute radiation exposure, individual radiosensitivity and injury in victims for a large-scale radiological incident Summary Following a large scale radiological or nuclear event, hundreds of thousands of people may be exposed to ionizing radiation/s and require subsequent dose-dependent medical management. It will be crucial to collect and analyze human biofluids (such as blood, urine, saliva) as soon as possible within the first week for accurate dose prediction and early triage decision. There is a need for FDA-approved in vitro diagnostic high-throughput biodosimetry devices with the ability to determine past radiation exposure with precision and accuracy. At the Center for High Throughput Radiation Biodosimetry, the Columbia University Center for Medical Countermeasures against Radiation (CMCR), we have developed FAST-DOSE (Fluorescent Automated Screening Tool for Dosimetry) assay system, to measure radiation-responsive proteins in human peripheral blood samples for retrospective estimation of radiation dose. The protein panel also includes biomarkers for blood leukocyte subtypes to reflect hematological sensitivity and injury. The FAST- DOSE assay system is intended as an in vitro diagnostic device (IVD) as defined by 21 CFR 809.3. The platform uses a commercial imaging flow cytometry system (ImageStream®X) and associated Image Data Exploration and Analysis Software (IDEAS®) to rapidly quantify changes in biomarker expression levels within specific cellular structures using fluorescent imagery and algorithms for estimation of absorbed dose. The studies planned here are designed to develop and optimize our FAST-DOSE assay system to accurately estimate absorbed dose and assess hematopoietic injury in human lymphocytes after ionizing irradiation. The first objective is to build on our current biomarker validation data for early engagement with the FDA via the pre-submission process. We have used the human ex vivo model and humanized mouse (Hu-NSG) and non- human primate (NHP) models to validate biomarker expression and radiosensitivity in blood leukocytes after acute ionizing radiation exposure. The Specific Aims proposed here are designed to: optimize the assay protocol and identify biomarker dose/time kinetics for accurate dose predictions in vitro and test 1) inter-donor variation, 2) intra-donor variation and 3) inter-laboratory variability (Aim 1); test the effect of specific confounders: age and sex, inheritance with germline BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant, and inflammation and trauma on the biomarker response, before and after irradiation (Aim 2); measure biomarker levels and time kinetics in vivo and correlate with hematopoietic injury, based on peripheral blood leukocyte counts, and stem and progenitor cell levels in the bone marrow of Hu-NSG mice (Aim 3) and, develop mathematical models (using machine learning and regression techniques) to select the best FAST-DOSE biomarkers and their combinations for generating dose predictions based on the ex vivo and in vivo dose response of these biomarkers (Aim 4). Our vision for future development is to develop a more simplified, faster rapid FAST-DOSE assay system whereby the biomarkers could be developed and transitioned for use in a point-of-care (POC) device. NARRATIVE We have developed a high-throughput biodosimetry device, the FAST-DOSE (Fluorescent Automated Screening Tool for Dosimetry) assay system to measure radiation-responsive proteins in human blood leukocytes for retrospective estimation of radiation dose. Studies are designed to validate and test the performance of the blood protein biomarker panel to accurately predict absorbed dose after ionizing radiation exposure. We will correlate biomarker expression levels and time kinetics with hematopoietic injury, based on peripheral blood leukocyte counts and bone marrow toxicity in humanized mice.","Development of

"Prism-PET: A TOF-DOI-Compton PET detector technology for total-body PET imaging Abstract  The relatively small axial field-of-view (FOV) in almost all PET scanners has severely limited their sensitivity and resulted in significant tradeoffs between image signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), acquisition time, and delivered dose. The solution is to improve geometric coverage using large axial FOV for total-body imaging which has the potential to improve sensitivity by about 40 times compared to existing commercial whole-body PET scanners. The construction of the world's first total-body PET/CT scan-ner, called EXPLORER, with 194-cm axial FOV has recently been completed. However, it has a poor time-of-flight (TOF) resolution of 430 ps, compared to the state-of-the-art whole-body PET scanner with 200 ps timing resolution (Siemens Biograph Vision). In addition, axial detector penetration of obliquely incident gamma photons detected within this wide acceptance angle will introduce significant depth-of-interaction (DOI) parallax error, leading to degraded spatial resolution. These two major defi-ciencies of the EXPLORER scanner offset its effective sensitivity gain, specially for imaging single organs such as the human brain when compared to the Biograph Vision PET scanner. For this research, we propose to build cost-effective block detectors with combined highest spatial resolution (2 mm), highest TOF resolution (<120 ps and potentially 100 ps), best DOI localization (1.85 mm), and highest inter- crystal Compton scatter recovery capabilities (88%) using single-ended readout and machine learning post-processing engines. Our novel detector module, called Prism-PET, enables these capabilities by mimicking very closely the behavior of dual-ended readout with enhanced and controlled light sharing using a segmented array of right angle prism-mirror light guides. Given our promising preliminary ex-perimental results, we aim to accomplish the following tasks: (1) model a prototype TOF-DOI PET scanner using GATE Monte Carlo simulations and use its list-mode data to develop our TOF-DOI image recontruction; (2) build Prism-PET detector modules and characterize coincidence detector blocks for DOI-corrected spatial resolution, energy resolution, and timing resolution and use machine learning to recover inter-crystal Compton scattered events to reach the 2-mm intrinsic spatial resolution without sacrificing sensitivity; (3) Build a one-ring prototype Prism-PET scanner; (4) perform normalization scan, optimize our image reconstruction using experimental coincidence events and validate the optimal imaging performance using Hot Spot phantoms. Our proposed TOF-DOI-Compton detector and system technologies maximize the sensitivity benefits of improved geometric coverage in total-body PET scanners across the entire FOV. Narratives/Relevance  The EXPLORER total-body PET scanner has limitations due to its poor timing resolution and lack of DOI-encoding, both of which offset its effective sensitivity gain, specially for imaging single organs, despite the very costly improvement of its geometric coverage. In the proposed work we will develop cost-effective and practical single-ended TOF-DOI-Compton PET detector modules, where these capabilities are enabled by using our novel right an-gle prism mirror light guides which enhance (1) light sharing by efficient 180-degree bending of photon paths and (2) crystal identification by localiz-ing the shared photons to only those immediate neighboring pixels that help with the correct identification. Our Prism-PET scanner with < 120 ps timing resolution, 1.85 mm DOI-encoding, and 88% Compton-scatter recovery miti-gates the limitations with the EXPLORER total-body scanner and achieves unparalleled spatial resolution and sensitivity.",Prism-PET: A TOF-DOI-Compton PET detector technology for total-body PET imaging,10233306,R01EB030413,"['positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' Radiation Tolerance ', ' Radiation Sensitivity ', ' Radiosensitivity ', ' radio-sensitivity ', ' radiosensitive ', ' Research ', ' Rotation ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Silicon ', ' Si element ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Temperature ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' Photons ', ' Custom ', ' Organ ', ' detector ', ' improved ', ' Penetration ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Training ', ' Recovery ', ' Collaborations ', ' Imaging Phantoms ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Performance ', ' photomultiplier ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' performance tests ', ' response ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Length ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Hot Spot ', ' Process ', ' PET/CT scan ', ' PET/CT ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' reconstruction ', ' cost effective ', ' Coupled ', ' Coupling ', ' prototype ', ' risk mitigation ', ' Geometry ', ' Compton radiation ', ' Compton scattering ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Calibration ', ' Crystallization ', ' Electronics ', ' electronic device ', ' Elements ', ' Floods ', ' Flooding ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' Industrialization ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Monte Carlo Method ', ' Monte Carlo algorithm ', ' Monte Carlo calculation ', ' Monte Carlo procedure ', ' Monte Carlo simulation ', ' Noise ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' PET ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET imaging ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PETT ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' ']",NIBIB,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2021,647165,NY-01
"Deep Learning Methods to Integrate Biological Information for Analysis of Single-cell RNAseq Data Project Summary The broad long-term objective of the project concerns the development of novel machine learning methods and computational tools for modeling genomic data motivated by important biological questions and experiments. The analysis of single-cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) data presents substantial computational and bioinformatics challenges. The specific aim of the project is to develop novel model-based deep learning methods with prior biological information considered for modelling scRNAseq data. These problems are all motivated by the PI’s close collaborations with biomedical investigators. The proposed approaches are designed to integrate biological information for improving both analytical performance and biological interpretability. The methods hinge on novel integration of biological insights and deep learning methods for analysis of the noisy, sparse, and over-dispersed scRNAseq data, including zero- inflated negative binominal model, autoencoder, deep embedding, hyperbolic embedding, and reversed graph embedding. The new methods can be applied to two important biological problems using the scRNAseq technologies: cell type identification and discovery via clustering analysis and cell developments via trajectory inference. They will facilitate effective analyses of the increasingly important scRNAseq data sets and contribute to the important on-going studies that the PI is currently collaborating on, Paneth cell regulation and regeneration of human hair follicles. The project will develop practical and feasible computer programs in order to implement the proposed methods, and to evaluate the performance of these methods through real applications. The work proposed here will contribute deep learning methods to modeling scRNAseq data and to studying complex phenotypes and biological systems and offer insights into each of the biological areas represented by the various data sets. All programs developed under this grant and detailed documentation will be made available free-of-charge to interested researchers. Undergraduates researchers from diverse backgrounds will be recruited as an integral part in the project for implementing most critical parts of the proposed aims. The research project will stimulate the interests of students so that they can consider a career in the biomedical sciences.

"Development of a commercially viable machine learning product to automatically detect rotator cuff muscle pathology PROJECT SUMMARY Rotator cuff tears are highly problematic for large patient populations, and therefore remain a very challenging clinical problem. Roughly 20% to 50% of those 60 years of age have a known rotator cuff tear and the prevalence only increases with age. While surgical reconstruction of the rotator cuff seeks to improve shoulder function and stability, the degrees of successful surgical outcomes vary significantly. These widely differing outcomes are because, pre-operatively, it is difficult under current evaluative methods to predict which patients will benefit from surgery versus those who will not. The focus of this project is to develop unique technology that replaces current methods to produce a rapid, accurate assessment of rotator cuffs capable of large-scale commercial deployment. From a clinical perspective, there is significant scientific evidence that excessive fat infiltration and atrophy of the rotator cuff muscles lead to poor outcomes because the presence of fatty tissue limits the ability for the muscle to recover and regenerate following tendon reconstruction. While current clinical practice utilizes magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate fat infiltration in the rotator cuff using qualitative scoring systems, previous studies have established that qualitative scoring has a relatively low correlation with quantitative measures of fat infiltration and atrophy. Incorporating quantitative measurements would dramatically improve clinical treatment decision-making. However, such evaluation under existing methods would require substantial manual input and thus is not clinically viable. A fast and accurate method for segmenting the rotator cuff muscles and quantifying fat infiltration is essential for improving outcomes and reducing unnecessary surgeries. This proposal aims to leverage Springbok’s previous technological innovations in machine learning image segmentation to develop an algorithm capable of fast, accurate assessment of rotator cuff muscle atrophy quantification and fat infiltration. The algorithm will be developed so that it can ultimately be seamlessly integrated into the current clinical workflow, thereby not requiring any additional clinician time, and in fact is likely to materially reduce that time. In Aim 1, we will develop and validate a deep-learning-based automatic algorithm for quantification of rotator cuff muscle volumes and fatty infiltration. In Aim 2, we will develop a software prototype to incorporate the algorithm into clinical workflow to support the decision-making process. Completion of this Phase 1 project will lead to a prototype product that is ready for beta-testing during Phase II at multiple Orthopaedic centers, enabling a 510(k) application for market clearance. This project will significantly improve the accuracy of shoulder pathology assessments, thus advancing the diagnosis and treatment of shoulder pathologies, improving the outcomes of costly Orthopaedic procedures, and potentially even eliminating unnecessary procedures, all of which will improve patient care and lower the associated costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rotator cuff tears are highly problematic for large patient populations such that clinicians need innovative tools to better determine who could benefit from surgical repair. This project will result in revolutionary technology capable of fast, precise measures of muscle atrophy and fat infiltration for accurate pre-intervention evaluation.",Development of a commercially viable machine learning product to automatically detect rotator cuff muscle pathology,10268004,R41AR078720,"['Adipose tissue ', ' Fatty Tissue ', ' adipose ', ' white adipose tissue ', ' yellow adipose tissue ', ' Adoption ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Client ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Muscular Atrophy ', ' Muscle Atrophy ', ' muscle breakdown ', ' muscle degradation ', ' muscle deterioration ', ' muscle loss ', ' muscle wasting ', ' Orthopedics ', ' Orthopedic ', ' Orthopedic Surgical Profession ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patents ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Natural regeneration ', ' Regeneration ', ' regenerate ', ' Shoulder ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Tendon structure ', ' Tendons ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Rotator Cuff ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' repaired ', ' repair ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Measurement ', ' Skeletal Muscle ', ' Voluntary Muscle ', ' radiologist ', ' Infiltration ', ' Atrophy ', ' Atrophic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Unnecessary Surgery ', ' Unnecessary Procedures ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Orthopedic Procedures ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Supraspinatus ', ' supraspinatus muscle ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' technological innovation ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI Scans ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Collection ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Slice ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' healing ', ' reconstruction ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' functional restoration ', ' restore function ', ' restore functionality ', ' restore lost function ', ' prototype ', ' patient population ', ' clinical practice ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' rotator cuff tear ', ' improved outcome ', ' cost outcomes ', ' surgery outcome ', ' surgical outcome ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine ', ' DICOM ', ' automated segmentation ', ' auto-segmentation ', ' automatic segmentation ', ' autosegmentation ', ' segmentation algorithm ', ' automated algorithm ', ' automatic algorithm ', ' ']",NIAMS,"SPRINGBOK, INC.",R41,2021,208204,VA-05
"Enhanced Software Tools for Detecting Anatomical Differences in Image Data Sets Project Summary Morphometric analysis is a primary algorithmic tool to discover disease and drug related effects on brain anatomy. Neurological degeneration and disease manifest in subtle and varied changes in brain anatomy that can be non-local in nature and affect amounts of white and gray matter as well as relative positioning and shapes of local brain anatomy. State-of-the-art morphometry methods focus on local matter distribution or on shape variations of apriori selected anatomies but have difficulty in detecting global or regional deterioration of matter; an important effect in many neurodegenerative processes. The proposal team recently developed a morphometric analysis based on unbalanced optimal transport, called UTM, that promises to be capable of discovering local and global alteration of matter without the need to apriori select an anatomical region of interest. The goal of this proposal is to develop the UTM technology into a software tool for automated high-throughput screening of large neurological image data sets. A more sensitive automated morphometric analysis tool will help researchers to discover neurological effects related to disease and lead to more efficient screening for drug related effects. Project Narrative  Describing anatomical differences in neurological image datasets is a key technology to non-invasively discover the effects of disease processes or drug treatments on brain anatomy. Current morphometric analysis focuses on local matter composition and on the shape of a priori defined regions of interest. The goal of this proposal is to extend the capabilities of image based morphometric analysis to be able to discover regionally varying deterioration and alteration of matter without the need for fine-grained segmentations and a priori definitions of regions of interest.",Enhanced Software Tools for Detecting Anatomical Differences in Image Data Sets,10265564,R42MH118845,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Goals ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Joints ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Software Validation ', ' Software Verification ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' morphometry ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Training ', ' Blood flow ', ' insight ', ' Neurosurgeon ', ' neuro-surgeon ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Metabolic ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' population-based study ', ' population-level study ', ' studies of populations ', ' study of the population ', ' Population Study ', ' regional difference ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' High Throughput Assay ', ' high throughput screening ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Population Analysis ', ' Neurologic Effect ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' web services ', ' web-based service ', ' image registration ', ' shape analysis ', ' shape description ', ' neurodegenerative dementia ', ' Outcome ', ' task analysis ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' Algorithmic Software ', ' Algorithmic Tools ', ' Software Algorithm ', ' metabolic rate ', ' Data Analytics ', ' data access ', ' web app ', ' web application ', ' imaging capabilities ', ' Drug Screening ', ' Grain ', ' deep learning ', ' analysis pipeline ', ' Visualization ', ' data infrastructure ', ' software infrastructure ', ' ']",NIMH,"KITWARE, INC.",R42,2021,1011802,NY-20
"NeuroExplorer: Ultra-high Performance Human Brain PET Imager for Highly-resolved In Vivo Imaging of Neurochemistry Research applications of brain Positron Emission Tomography (PET) have been in place for over 40 years. The combination of quantitative PET systems with novel radiotracers has led to a numerous imaging para- digms to understand normal brain physiology including neurotransmitter dynamics and receptor pharmacology at rest and during activation. Brain-dedicated PET systems offer important advantages over currently available PET systems in terms of sensitivity and resolution. However, the state-of-the-art for brain PET has not progressed beyond the 20-year-old HRRT. Therefore, there is a compelling need to build the next generation of brain PET systems for human studies. This proposal brings together a highly experienced collaborative team from Yale, UC Davis, and United Imaging Healthcare America (UIHA). to develop the next generation NeuroEXPLORER (NX) PET system with the following Aims. Specific Aim 1: Design and Build the NeuroEXPLORER: In 2 years, we will complete the design and build the NX system. The design includes high performance LYSO-SiPM blocks with small detectors, 4-mm depth-of-interaction, 250 ps time-of-flight resolution, and axial length of ~50 cm, paired with CT for attenuation correction. This design will produce a factor of 10 greater effective sensitivity than the HRRT and practical resolution of 1.5-2 mm in the human brain. The system will include built-in real-time state-of-art motion tracking cameras and will be tested using novel phantom experiments to assess the full-range of operation to validate the dramatic improvement in small- region precision and accuracy. Specific Aim 2: Algorithm Development for Fully-Quantitative Brain PET. We will develop the novel algorithms for this system. Using EXPLORER experience. we will implement reconstruction algorithms to produce dynamic images with uniform ultra-high resolution in space and time, Extending Yale’s HRRT motion correction experience, we will develop camera-based motion detection and correction algorithms to deliver ultra-high resolution human brain images. Using the carotid artery shape and geometry, we will develop methods to accurately measure blood activity to be compared to human arterial data with the goal to permit kinetic modeling without arterial sampling. We will develop noise reduction methods with machine learning to reduce dose for studying health brains and to eliminate the need for the CT scan for attenuation correction. Specific Aim 3: Human Paradigm Demonstration. With human subjects, we will evaluate specific imaging paradigms to demonstrate the effectiveness of the NX system: 1) demonstration of the dramatic sensitivity increase (with a direct comparison to the HRRT) and its impact on detection of pharmacologic effects, 2) leveraging high sensitivity to reliably measure uptake in small nuclei; and 3) opening new frontiers of imaging neurotransmitter dynamics, including dopamine and opioid release. The ultimate goal is a fully functioning and characterized system that dramatically expands the scope of brain PET protocols and applications.

"Investigating how mechanical connectivity yields developmental robustness ABSTRACT  It is essential for the fate of an organism that key morphogenetic processes occur reproducibly even under tissue damage or environmental perturbations. While much is known about how genetic redundancy and regulation achieves robust development, less is understood about how a tissue mechanically ensures reproducible shape change when perturbed. This project uncovers how populations of physically interacting cells mechanically respond to challenging conditions and modify their collective behavior to still sculpt the correct final shape.  One way for cells to coordinate tissue-scale forces and movements is through direct mechanical connections. In fact, many developing tissues exhibit supracellular networks of actomyosin connections that link hundreds of cells. A large roadblock has been with the challenges of imaging and quantifying subcellular protein at the tissue scale. I adapted a topological smoothing algorithm originally used to trace high-noise filamentous structure of galaxies in the Universe to data to trace high-noise filamentous myosin structure in confocal images. This allowed for the first quantification of a supracellular myosin network across an entire tissue over developmental time. Subsequent analysis adopting techniques from network theory allowed me to identify that the robust folding of the Drosophila fruit fly embryo during ventral furrow formation is mechanically ensured by patterns in the supracellular network spanning its ventral cells.  This newly discovered importance of supracellular networks in coordinating robust shape change highlights the need for a comprehensive understanding of how supracellular networks form, and how their patterns impact the function and robustness of a population of cells. Deciphering robustness at the tissue-level, where the displacement and fate of hundreds of cells must be considered, requires techniques at the interface of cell and developmental biology, biophysics and computer science. The proposed project will take a highly interdisciplinary approach to identify how supracellular network patterns are controlled molecularly, at the cell level, and via tissue constraints. As well, how heterogeneity in tissue-level patterns impacts morphogenetic robustness will be addressed. Together this comprehensive study of the structure and function of supracellular networks will represent a new way to interpret mechanical robustness across diverse developing tissues. As well, a generalized description of mechanical robustness has the potential to uncover new paths to predict and control tissue malformation, which would represent a significant advance for both developmental biology and fetal medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE The robust establishment of correct shape is essential for proper tissue function. Tissue shape change is a mechanical process that necessitates the coordinated force generation and motion of thousands of cells. Identifying how physically interacting cells mechanically respond to challenging conditions and modify their behavior to still sculpt the correct final shape will shed light onto many congenital disorders that result from morphogenetic dysregulation.",Investigating how mechanical connectivity yields developmental robustness,10261353,K99GM136915,"['Congenital Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Malformation ', ' Actomyosin ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Behavior ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' cell culture ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Developmental Biology ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drosophila genus ', ' Drosophila ', ' fruit fly ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Engineering ', ' Exhibits ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' In Vitro ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Morphogenesis ', ' morphogenetic process ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Myosin ATPase ', ' Actin-Activated ATPase ', ' Myosin Adenosine Triphosphatase ', ' Myosin Adenosinetriphosphatase ', ' Myosins ', ' Neural Tube Defects ', ' Neural Tube Developmental Defects ', ' Noise ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Proteins ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Transportation ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' congenital heart disorder ', ' congenital cardiac abnormality ', ' congenital cardiac disease ', ' congenital cardiac disorder ', ' congenital cardiac malformation ', ' congenital heart abnormality ', ' congenital heart anomaly ', ' congenital heart disease ', ' congenital heart malformation ', ' Cell Size ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Stimulus ', ' Congenital Disorders ', ' Galaxy ', ' Genetic ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' cell biology ', ' Cellular biology ', ' Adopted ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' fetal ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' cohesion ', ' computer science ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Regulation ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' in vivo ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' fly ', ' Flies ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Population ', ' malformation ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' fetal medicine ', ' optogenetics ', ' mechanical properties ', ' mechanical force ', ' Maternal-fetal medicine ', ' confocal imaging ', ' tissue-level behavior ', ' ']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,K99,2021,98836,MA-07
"A two-dimensional antiscatter grid for dental cone beam computed tomography Project summary Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) is a commonly used 3D x-ray imaging modality in dental and craniofacial imaging. While CBCT is primarily employed in evaluating bony anatomy in 3D, soft tissues are often poorly visualized in dental CBCT images. Moreover, tissue densities cannot be extracted accurately from CBCT images. The main culprit behind this problem is scattered radiation. Scattered x-rays emanating from the patient are registered by the x-ray sensor, severely degrading the fidelity of image signals. Thus, in this project, we propose a novel two-dimensional antiscatter grid (2D grid) to substantially improve the dental CBCT image quality. Our proposed 2D grid will attenuate scattered x-rays effectively, while transmitting primary, or useful, x-rays to the image sensor. Once successfully implemented, our 2D grid will provide significantly improved soft tissue visualization, accurate bone density measurement, and will reduce image artifacts. Alternatively, our 2D grid can reduce imaging radiation dose while providing comparable contrast-to- noise ratio with respect to current dental CBCT images. To implement our proposed 2D grid technology, (1) we will investigate the optimal physical characteristics of 2D grids to achieve effective scatter suppression and high primary transmission. (2) We will evaluate the improvement in CBCT image quality provided by 2D grid in phantom imaging experiments. Project narrative While cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) is the most commonly used 3D imaging modality in dentistry, its utilization is hampered by its poor image quality. The main culprit behind this problem is the high intensity of scattered radiation inherent to CBCT systems.

"A System for Xerostomia Risk Classification after Head & Neck Cancer Radiotherapy Summary Radiotherapy (RT) is a major component in the treatment of most head and neck cancer (HNC) cases. During irradiation, sensitive regions such as the salivary glands can sustain injury, resulting in xerostomia (dry mouth). This side effect is common and can significantly reduce quality of life during and post-treatment. The focus of this application is prediction during treatment planning of whether patients will suffer high-grade xerostomia (NCI CTCAE Grade 2-3) at the time of their first post-treatment follow-up visit, typically 3-6 months after RT (prevalence is approximately 40%). Predictions will enable clinicians to carry out treatment planning with improved knowledge of the likelihood of high-grade xerostomia development and allow better-informed and more timely anticipation of consequences such as eating difficulty. In this Phase 1 project, Oncospace Inc. will develop a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) prediction model using over 1200 complete HNC patient records. Associations between high-grade xerostomia and a wide range of dosimetric, clinical and demographic features will be automatically discovered and the features with the strongest associations will populate the nodes of a decision tree. The terminal leaf nodes will each contain the probability of high-grade xerostomia for the subset of patients in that node. In addition, leaf nodes will be assigned binary class labels designating a high- or low risk of high-grade xerostomia. This type of model provides transparency and interpretability, which are beneficial for clinical acceptance and for demonstration of safety to regulatory agencies. The software will be built using the Microsoft Azure cloud architecture and be deployed via a Software as a Service (SaaS) model. There are three distinct aims of this project:  1. Populate Oncospace Inc.’s Microsoft Azure CosmosDB database with data licensed from Johns Hopkins  University, including steps such as patient de-identification, data curation, and additional dataset feature engineering  2. Perform CART modeling and test model accuracy, using separate training and test datasets and a variety  of performance metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, AUC, and F1-score.  3. Design a clinically acceptable risk classification strategy and a user interface (UI) to communicate model  results. Expert input from a team of UI consultants and three radiation oncologists will be an integral part  of the development, testing, and evaluation processes. The successful completion of these aims will demonstrate the clinical and commercial feasibility of a xerostomia prediction model for HNC. Further development in Phase 2 will include deeper model personalization via incorporation of advanced image features (radiomics), as well as validation of model generalizability and commercial viability via the curation and use in model building of data from other institutions. Oncospace, formed in 2018, is uniquely positioned to carry out this work as the team includes the creators of the Pinnacle radiation therapy planning system, Tomotherapy radiation treatment delivery system, and HealthMyne Quantitative Imaging Decision Support platform. Oncospace has close clinical collaboration with Johns Hopkins University (JHU) for clinical feedback, validation and initial deployment. Oncospace has licensed three patents and subscription to complete patient treatment records for over 6,000 radiation oncology patients from JHU. The company has won the Microsoft Innovation Acceleration Award for its innovative platform to deliver AI-enabled healthcare solutions to the radiation oncology community.

"Robust AI to develop risk models in retinopathy of prematurity using deep learning ROP is a retinal neovascular disease affecting preterm infants, and is a leading cause of childhood blindness worldwide. Known clinical risk factors include preterm birth, low birthweight and use of supplemental oxygen but improved risk models are needed to identify infants that progress to treatment requiring disease and blindness. Deep learning techniques have been used to successfully identify “plus” disease in multi- institutional cohorts and to provide a continuous measure of disease severity. A major limitation of deep learning, however, is the need for large amounts of well curated datasets. Other limitations include overfitting and “brittleness” that can cause model performance to drop on external data. There are, however, numerous barriers to building and hosting these large central repositories with multi-institutional data required for robust deep learning including concerns about data sharing, regulations costs, patient privacy and intellectual property. In this project, we aim to demonstrate the utility of distributed/federated deep learning approaches where the data are located within institutions, but model parameters are shared with a central server. A major challenge thwarting this research, however, is the requirement for large quantities of labeled image data to train deep learning models. Efforts to create large public centralized collections of image data are hindered by barriers to data sharing, costs of image de-identification, patient privacy concerns, and control over how data are used. Current deep learning models that are being built using data from one or a few institutions are limited by potential overfitting and poor generalizability. Instead of centralizing or sharing patient images, we aim to distribute the training of deep learning models across institutions with computations performed on their local image data. Specifically, we seek to build robust risk models for predicting treatment requiring disease. Two large cohorts will be used to validate the hypothesis that the performance of the risk models using distributed learning approaches that of centrally hosted and is more robust than models built on single institutional datasets.

"Supplemental transmission aided attenuation correction for high performance quantitative PET imaging PROJECT SUMMARY Quantitative tracer images from combined PET-CT and PET-MR are increasingly being utilized for radiological decision-making and clinical trials. CT and MR based data corrections for PET photon attenuation, typically the largest impact on tracer quantification, can lead to increased radiation dose to the subject or require lengthy additional dedicated MR scans, respectively. Artificial intelligence algorithms that use the PET signal originating from the subject alone to estimate attenuation have shown promising early results, but, can have reduced performance when applied to exams different from the training data. Reconstruction methods that jointly estimate both the measured attenuation and tracer contrast from the subject PET signal represent a viable alternative, but, to date, have failed to match the quantification of CT approaches. Consequently, no single approach for PET attenuation correction that consistently produces high quantification and does not compromise patient safety or throughput currently exists. This is an important problem, since research and clinical findings must balance these practical issues with data quality. The overall objective of this proposal is to develop and characterize a high performance attenuation correction scheme that utilizes both the PET signal from the subject and a variable activity external source. The central hypothesis is that the proposed reconstruction method will have significantly improved performance over reconstruction algorithms using PET signal originating from the subject alone, independent of the imaging study. The two specific aims include: 1) developing and validating a supplemental transmission-based algorithm for correcting PET images for photon attenuation during commercial PET imaging and 2) prototyping and characterizing a device capable of dynamically varying external source activity. The result of Aim 1 will be a reconstruction algorithm that is optimized to produce quantitative PET data for some of the most common clinical PET studies. Under Aim 2, a prototype device that can repeatability vary the external source activity in order to maximize tracer quantification while minimizing the unavoidable degradation to patient tracer image noise, caused by the introduction of any external source, will be produced. The innovation is an attenuation correction strategy that greatly mitigates the limitations of previous joint reconstruction methods to deliver quantitative PET diagnostics that are expected to match those of silver standard CT approaches. This is significant because the number of patients receiving brain and cardiac PET-CT scans, exams the proposed method is expected to benefit, is steadily increasing. For PET-MR, the method may improve tracer quantification where MR has limited performance and increase patient throughput by eliminating the need for non-diagnostic attenuation-only MR acquisitions. Thus, the proposed strategy has great potential to significantly improve radiological decision- making and clinical trial findings that rely on quantitative PET uptake measurements. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to the public health because the development of a PET radiotracer attenuation correction strategy that is independent of the exam type, has the potential to improve the strength of research and clinical findings based on quantitative PET measurements.

"Automatic Organ Segmentation Tool for Radiation Treatment Planning of Cancers ABSTRACT As early detection and better treatment have increased cancer patient survival rates, the importance of protecting normal organs during radiation treatment is drawing more attention, which is critical in reducing long term toxicity of cancers. To avoid excessively high radiation doses to organs-at-risk (OARs), OARs need to be correctly segmented from simulation computed tomography (CT) scans during radiation treatment planning to get an accurate dose distribution. Despite tremendous effort in developing semi- or fully-automatic segmentation solutions, current automated segmentation software, mostly using the atlas-based methods, has not yet reached the level of accuracy and robustness required for clinical usage. Therefore, in current practice, significant manual efforts are still required in the OAR segmentation process. Manual contouring suffers from inter- and intra-observer variability, as well as institutional variability where different sites adopt distinct contouring atlases and labeling criteria, thus leading to inaccuracy and variability in OAR segmentation. When OARs are very close to the treatment target, segmentation errors as small as a few millimeters can have a statistically significant impact on dosimetry distribution and outcome. In addition, it is also costly and time consuming as it can take 1-2 hours of a clinicians’ time to segment major thoracic organs due to the large number of axial slices required. In summary, an accurate and fast process for segmenting OARs in treatment planning using CT scans is needed for improving patient outcomes and reducing the cost of radiation therapy of cancers. In recent years, the rapid development of deep learning methods has revolutionized many computer-vision areas and the adoption of deep learning in medical applications has shown great success. Based on a deep-learning-based algorithm we developed that achieved better-than-human performance and ranked 1st in 2017 American Association of Physicist in Medicine Thoracic Auto-segmentation Challenge, an automatic OAR segmentation product will be developed in this project with the three aims: 1) further improve the performance and robustness of OAR segmentation algorithms, focusing on addressing the heterogeneity issue of different clinical environments; 2) further enrich the functionalities and enhance usability of the cloud- based software product; and 3) perform clinical validation study on the algorithm performance and software usability at collaborating sites. With this product, the segmentation accuracy can be improved, leading to more robust treatment plans in protecting normal organs and improved long term patient outcome. The time and cost of radiation treatment planning can be greatly reduced, contributing to a more affordable cancer treatment and reduced healthcare burden. NARRATIVE As early detection and better treatment have increased cancer patient survival rates, the importance of protecting normal organs during radiation treatment is drawing more attention.

"Deep-learning-based prediction of AMD and its progression with GWAS and fundus image data Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Successful genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of AMD have identified many disease-susceptibility genes. Through great efforts from international GWAS consortium and large-scale collaborative projects, massive datasets including high-quality GWAS data and well-characterized clinical phenotypes are now available in public repositories such as dbGaP and UK Biobank. Clinically, color fundus images have been extensively used by ophthalmologists to diagnose AMD and its severity level. The combination of wealthy GWAS data and fundus image data provides an unprecedented opportunity for researchers to test new hypotheses that are beyond the objectives of original projects. Among them, predictive models for AMD development and its progression based on both GWAS and fundus image data have not been explored. Most existing prediction models only focus on classic statistical approaches, often regression models with a limited number of predictors (e.g., SNPs). Moreover, most predictions only give static risks rather than dynamic risk trajectories over time, of which the latter is more informative for a progressive disease like AMD. Recent advances of machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning, have been proven to significantly improve prediction accuracy by incorporating multiple layers of hidden non-linear effects when large-scale training datasets with well-defined phenotypes are available. Despite its success in many areas, deep learning has not been fully explored in AMD and other eye diseases. Motivated by multiple large-scale studies of AMD development or progression, where GWAS and/or longitudinal fundus image data have been collected, we propose novel deep learning methods for predicting AMD status and its progression, and to identify subgroups with significant different risk profiles. Specially, in Aim 1, we will construct a novel local convolutional neural network to predict disease occurrence (AMD or not) and severity (e.g., mild AMD, intermediate AMD, late AMD) based on (1a): a large cohort of 35,000+ individuals with GWAS data and (1b): a smaller cohort of 4,000+ individuals with both GWAS and fundus image data. In Aim 2, we will develop a novel deep neural network survival model for predicting individual disease progression trajectory (e.g., time to late-AMD). In both aims, we will use the local linear approximation technique to identify important predictors that contribute to individual risk profile prediction and to identify subgroups with different risk profiles. In Aim 3, we will validate and calibrate our methods using independent cohorts and implement proposed methods into user-friendly software and easy-to-access web interface. With the very recent FDA approval for Beovu, a novel injection treatment for wet AMD (one type of late AMD) by inhibiting VEGF and thus suppressing the growth of abnormal blood vessels, it makes our study more significant, as it will provide most cutting-edge and comprehensive prediction models for AMD which have great potential to facilitate early diagnosis and tailored treatment and clinical management of the disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this proposal is to develop new analytic methods and software tools to facilitate novel prediction of AMD development and its progression. The successful completion of the project will generate the first comprehensive set of deep-learning-based prediction models and web-based interfaces, which jointly analyzes large-scale GWAS and fundus image data and has the great potential to enhance the early diagnosis and current clinical management of AMD.

"Computational and Statistical Framework to Model Tissue Shape and Mechanics PROJECT SUMMARY  The morphologic and mechanical characteristics of a tissue are fundamental to understanding the development, homeostasis, and pathology of the human body. During the previous period of funding, we developed statistical shape modeling (SSM) methods and applied these to the study of structural hip disease. We also developed the initial framework to integrate SSM with finite element (FE) analysis to enable the study of shape and mechanics together. If incorporated into clinical practice, SSM and FE analysis could identify features of the anatomy likely responsible for injury, remodeling, or repair. Geometry needed for SSM and FE models is typically generated by segmentation of volumetric imaging data. This step can be painstakingly slow, error prone, and cost prohibitive, which hampers clinical application of these computational techniques. We have created a deep machine learning algorithm ‘DeepSSM’ that uses a convolutional neural network to establish the correspondence model directly from unsegmented images. In Aim 1 we will apply DepSSM to improve clinical understanding of structural hip disease by characterizing differences in anatomy between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals; these morphometric comparisons will identify anatomic features most telling of disease, thereby guiding improvements in diagnosis. Computational advancements have simplified the process to generate patient-specific FE models, enabling clinically focused research. However, there is no framework to collectively visualize, compare, and interpret (i.e., post-process) results from multiple FE models. Currently, inter-subject comparisons require oversimplifications such as averaging results over subjectively defined regions. In Aim 2 we will develop new post-processing methods to collectively visualize, interpret and statistically analyze FE results across multiple subjects and study groups. We will map FE results to synthetic anatomies representing statistically meaningful distributions using the correspondence model. Statistical parametric mapping will be applied to preserve anatomic detail through statistical testing. We will use our published FE models of hip joint mechanics as the test system. Finally, volumetric images provide a wealth of information that is delivered to physicians in a familiar format. Yet, tools are not available to interpret model data with clinical findings from volumetric images. In Aim 3, we will develop methods that evaluate relationships between shape, mechanics, and clinical findings gleaned from imaging through integrated statistical tests and semi-automatic medical image annotation tools that utilize standard ontologies. Quantitative CT and MRI images of the hip, which estimate bone density and cartilage ultrastructure, respectively, will be evaluated as test datasets. To impart broad impact, we will disseminate our methods to the community as open source software that will call core functionality provided by existing, open source software that has a large user base (FEBio, ShapeWorks). PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed technology will provide the methodologies necessary to increase the clinical acceptance and applicability of computer models.

"Improving membrane proteins' 3D reconstructions with cryo-electron microscopy While the development of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has already proven to revolutionize the field of structural biology by imaging biomolecules in solution, the vast majority of proteins cannot be reconstructed at a satisfying resolution. Among them, membrane proteins still remain an imaging challenge for biologists - despite being prominent targets for over half of prescription drugs on the pharmaceutical market. The proposed work develops a novel mathematical and statistical method that will enhance the resolution of cryo-EM, targeting the 3D imaging and reconstruction of membrane proteins.   The main challenges that we solve, and the novelty of this approach, come from statistics and differential geometry. From a statistical perspective, the proposal revisits the paradigm of cryo-EM shape reconstruction, by replacing the traditional ""expectation-maximization"" learning procedure by its faster and scalable counterpart, called ""variational inference"". In order to apply ""variational inference"" in this context, our solution implements the differential geometry of 3D shape spaces within the recent and popular dimension reduction method of ""variational autoencoders"". By improving the efficiency of the image reconstruction algorithm, while benchmarking its accuracy, we leverage the extraordinary amount of raw data produced by cryoEM. In turn, processing more data improves the resolution of the reconstructed biomolecular shapes. The originality of the proposed project is to leverage statistics and mathematics that have not yet penetrated the communities of machine learning and biological imaging. Our proposal is also broadly applicable beyond cryo-EM and biological imaging. Reconstructing biomolecular shapes is the focus of several imaging modalities, such as coherent diffraction for single particle imaging, that produce images whose analysis is an on-going research of members of our team. The proposal translates to the representation of shapes for these technologies. The proposal addresses technical topics that are pivotal for pharmaceutical and medical research. Our long-term vision is to advance knowledge on membrane proteins' 3D structures when bound to FDA-approved drugs, and facilitate structure-based drug design with improved selectivity. We anticipate an important societal impact for pharmacology and medicine.",Improving membrane proteins' 3D reconstructions with cryo-electron microscopy,10378342,R01GM144965,"['Membrane Proteins ', ' Membrane Protein Gene ', ' Membrane-Associated Proteins ', ' Surface Proteins ', ' improved ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Cryo-electron Microscopy ', ' Electron Cryomicroscopy ', ' cryo-EM ', ' cryoEM ', ' Cryoelectron Microscopy ', ' Instruction ', ' reconstruction ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA BARBARA,R01,2021,199999,CA-24
"Interpretable Deep Learning Algorithms for Pathology Image Analysis Interpretable Deep Learning Algorithms for Pathology Image Analysis Abstract The microscopic examination of stained tissue is a fundamental component of biomedical research and for the understanding of biological processes of disease which leads to improved diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic response prediction. Ranging from cancer diagnosis to heart rejection and forensics the subjective interpretation of histopathology sections forms the basis of clinical decision making and research outcomes. However, it has been shown that such subjective interpretation of pathology slides suffers from large interobserver and intraobserver variability. Recent advances in computer vision and deep learning has enabled the objective and automated analysis of images. These methods have been applied with success to histology images which have demonstrated potential for development of objective image interpretation paradigms. However, significant algorithmic challenges remain to be addressed before such objective analysis of histology images can be used by clinicians and researchers. Leveraging extensive experience in developing and decimating research software based on deep learning the PI will pioneer novel algorithmic approaches to address these challenges including but not limited to: (1) training data-efficient and interpretable deep learning models with gigapixel size microscopy images for classification and segmentation using weakly supervised labels (2) fundamental redesign of data fusion paradigms for integrating information from microscopy images and molecular profiles (from multi-omics data) for improved diagnostic and prognostic determinations (3) developing visualization and interpretation software for researchers and clinical workflows to improve clinical and research validation and reproducability. The system will be designed in a modular, user-friendly manner and will be open-source, available through GitHub as universal plug-and-play modules ready to be adapted to various clinical and research applications. We will also develop a web resource with pretrained models for various organs, disease states and subtypes these will be accompanied with detailed manuals so researchers can apply deep learning to their specific research problems. Overall, the laboratory’s research will yield high impact discoveries from pathology image analysis, and its software will enable many other NIH funded laboratories to do the same, across various biomedical disciplines.

"Administrative Equipment Supplement for GM135160 PROJECT SUMMARY Cellular shape change is a fundamental characteristic of metazoan cells that is key to development, physiology, and pathology. The formation and plasticity of neural networks are key examples of cell shape change during development and physiology, whereas cell shape and motility goes awry in cancers such as melanoma. The active control of the cytoskeleton is acknowledged as critical to cellular shape change, whereas the concurrent remodeling of the plasma membrane is perhaps less well appreciated. Although many cytoskeletal and membrane remodeling components are known and their biochemical and structural characteristics described, we lack a systematic understanding of how these disparate systems are regulated and coordinated to orchestrate cellular shape change. Perhaps the most important problem in cell morphogenesis is understanding how cells perceive cues in their environment and convert this extracellular information into shape changes through coordinated cytoskeletal dynamics and plasma membrane remodeling. Functions of small GTPases and kinases are well studied in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics and membrane remodeling. Work from my lab identified an emerging role for E3 ubiquitin ligases in regulated cellular shape change. We identified two E3 ubiquitin ligases, TRIM9 and TRIM67, which regulate cytoskeletal and exocytic proteins and cellular shape changes in response to netrin. Netrin is an extracellular morphogen that promotes neuronal morphogenesis and the progression of cancers, such as melanoma. TRIM9 and TRIM67 thus provided an excellent entry point for the lab to investigate how cytoskeletal and membrane remodeling are coordinated during netrin triggered morphogenesis and motility. TRIM9 and TRIM67 share similar sequences, localization, and interaction partners, however our studies identified distinct functions of these related proteins and antagonistic phenotypes associated with their deletion. The overarching goal of this program is to test the hypothesis that TRIM9 and TRIM67 coordinate cytoskeletal dynamics and exocytosis during netrin-dependent morphogenesis in neurons and migrating melanoma cells. Our work will provide fundamental mechanistic understanding of the regulation of the cytoskeleton and membrane trafficking during development and metastasis. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cellular shape change is a fundamental characteristic of cells, key to development, physiology, and pathology. The morphogen netrin promotes neuronal development and cancer progression, yet we know little about how cells interpret netrin into shape changes.

"Dual Energy CT-enabled Asymptomatic Pulmonary Embolism Detection on Non-contrast CT Project Summary Asymptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE) are often incidentally discovered from contrast computed tomography (CT) scans that do not target PE. It has a mean prevalence of 2.6% among patients and associated with increased mortality rate and recurrence of PE. Currently non-contrast CT are not read by radiologists for PE, because the hyperintensity signal of thrombolysis on NCCT is weak. Hence, around 2.6% of the patients with NCCT can have asymptomatic PE but are not diagnosed at all, which is potentially a large population.  We propose a deep learning-based automatic PE detection algorithm for single-energy NCCT to improve the cost-effectiveness to discover asymptomatic PE from NCCT. The algorithm will be used to identify patients with higher probability of PE and call for human reading or contrast CT scans. A major challenge is training data accumulation due to the relatively low prevalence of asymptomatic PE and hardness of reading NCCT. To overcome this challenge, we propose to utilize dual energy CT (DECT), which is becoming routinely used for PE diagnosis, to generate virtual non-contrast (VNC) images as training images. We propose to use deep learning algorithm for the VNC generation to fill the image quality gap between VNC images and real single-energy NCCT, which ensures that our PE detection algorithm trained on VNC images can be readily applied to real NCCT.  The expected outcome of the project is (1) a deep learning algorithm to generate realistic VNC images from contrast DECT; (2) a deep learning algorithm to screen PE from NCCT with high sensitivity. Project Narrative Asymptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE) is a pulmonary disorder which is usually incidentally found on contrast computed tomography (CT), but patients with non-contrast CT are often overlooked. This project will develop a deep learning-based PE detection algorithm for single-energy, non-contrast CT scans.

"Cardiac CT Deblooming PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common type of heart disease, killing over 370,000 Americans annu- ally2. Cardiac CT is a safe, accurate, non-invasive method widely employed for diagnosis of CAD and planning therapeutic interventions. With the current CT technology, calcium blooming artifacts severely limit the accuracy of coronary stenosis assessment. Similarly, stent blooming artifacts lead to overestimation of in-stent restenosis. As a result, many coronary CT angiography (CCTA) scans are non-diagnostic and result in patients receiving costly and invasive coronary angiography (ICA) procedures.  Based on extensive feasibility results, the goal of this project is to use deep learning innovations to fundamen- tally eliminate blooming artifacts without costly redesign of the CT hardware. A consortium between GE Re- search, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Weill Cornell Medicine will develop dedicated imaging protocols and machine learning methods to avoid or minimize blooming artifacts and evaluate the clinical impact of the proposed solutions. In Aim 1, the CT scan protocol will be optimized and paired with deep learning reconstruc- tion and post-processing algorithms to generate high-resolution CT images and prevent blooming artifacts. In Aim 2, image-domain and raw-data-domain deep learning processing algorithms will be developed to correct for residual blooming. After successful demonstration of the proposed methods on phantom scans and emulated clinical datasets, in Aim 3 the proposed CT methods will be clinically demonstrated and optimized based on 100 patients with coronary artery disease, using intravascular ultrasound as the ground-truth reference.  At the end of the project, we will have demonstrated and publicly disseminated a systematic methodology to essentially remove blooming artifacts in cardiac CT without a costly hardware upgrade. This will be another suc- cess of deep learning, enabling accurate coronary stenosis assessment and eliminating many unnecessary diag- nostic catheterizations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Blooming artifacts severely limit the accuracy of coronary stenosis assessment with cardiac CT, leading to un- necessary invasive coronary angiography procedures.

"Quality and Safety Monitoring of Clinical Computed Tomography Practice Abstract – Fifty percent of radiation exposure to the United States population is from medical imaging, half of which come from over 80 million computed tomography (CT) scans performed every year. This significant use has raised notable concerns regarding utilization costs, inappropriate applications, and the associated radiation risk. A recent Medicare reports hundreds of hospitals across the country have needlessly scanned their patients twice on the same day. Unnecessary repeated scans expose patients to extra radiation while increase expense, decrease reimbursement, and increase liability for the providers. Thus, the legislative and regulatory organizations have encouraged and mandated stricter oversight of medical imaging usage and its associated radiation. Concurrent to the mandate to better manage imaging risk is to ensure its value: One of the quintessential but most understated pillars of current CT practice is CT’s high value in caring for illness and injury across all ages. To ensure this benefit of CT examinations, there needs to be a careful balance between image quality and radiation safety. A poor quality, overly low dose exam is a disservice to the care of the patient while an exam with more radiation dose than necessary can undermine its safety. Therefore, proper CT imaging requires a comprehensive combined quality and dose monitoring program on a patient-by-patient basis to properly understand, manage, and mitigate radiation risk. Unfortunately, currently there is no such software available in the market that can simultaneously monitor CT radiation dose and its corresponding image quality. The objective of this fast-track project is to develop a first Software as a Service (SaaS)-based performance monitoring platform to track radiation dose and image quality concurrently. The platform aims to provide essential data and insight to improve CT performance through considering both patient safety and imaging quality simultaneously. Specifically, the project will develop a product that offers 1) a robust multi-infrastructure workflow to connect and collect clinical CT quality- and dose-relevant data; 2) a suite of patient-specific CT radiation dose and image quality assessment algorithms; 3) an implementation of a task manager to chain and automate dose and image quality calculations towards CT performance assessment; 4) a combined SQL- NoSQL database system for structured and un-structured quality- and dose-relevant data storage; and 5) a web-based dashboard for interactive and easy-to-use data analysis and visualization. The development utilizes machine-learning methodologies to devise robust and scalable techniques for extracting meaningful knowledge from hundreds of thousands of patient images. The system quantifies value for a value-based practice. It serves as an essential tool to minimize variability in quality and dose across a practice, to ensure consistent use of CT technology, and to ensure imaging radiation dose and quality levels match expected values. The system will be beta tested at healthcare facilities paving the way toward effective commercialization. 1 Project Narrative The dose and image quality in the clinical practice of computed tomography (CT) imaging is highly variable due to variability across diverse technical and human factors. More radiation dose yields better quality images, necessitating a balance between the two in a way that is patient-specific and trackable. The project aims to develop a tracking and analytics platform to minimize variability and to assure the balance of quality and dose across clinical practice.",Quality and Safety Monitoring of Clinical Computed Tomography Practice,10253256,R44EB031658,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Contrast Media ', ' Contrast Agent ', ' Contrast Drugs ', ' Radiopaque Media ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Database Management Systems ', ' Data Base Management ', ' Data Base Management Systems ', ' database management ', ' database systems ', ' relational database management systems ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Equipment ', ' Fluoroscopy ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' care facilities ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Insurance ', ' Mammography ', ' Mammogram ', ' mammographic Imaging ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' mammographic exams ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Patients ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Diagnostic radiologic examination ', ' Conventional X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic Radiology ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray Radiology ', ' Radiography ', ' Roentgenography ', ' X-Ray Imaging ', ' X-Ray Medical Imaging ', ' Xray imaging ', ' Xray medical imaging ', ' conventional Xray ', ' diagnostic Xray ', ' diagnostic Xray radiology ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' X-Ray Radiation ', ' X-ray ', ' Xray ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' repaired ', ' repair ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Dental ', ' insight ', ' Intuition ', ' Individual ', ' Data Storage and Retrieval ', ' data retrieval ', ' data storage ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Nuclear ', ' Radiation Dose ', ' Radiation Dose Unit ', ' data management ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' Radiation ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' patient safety ', ' Provider ', ' Phase Transition ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' beneficiary ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' interoperability ', ' graphical user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' software user interface ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' clinical practice ', ' data exchange ', ' data transfer ', ' data transmission ', ' computer infrastructure ', ' computational infrastructure ', ' operation ', ' data visualization ', ' imaging system ', ' profiles in patients ', ' patient profile ', ' informatics infrastructure ', ' software as a service ', ' dashboard ', ' radiation risk ', ' Radiation exposure ', ' clinical imaging ', ' clinical implementation ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Patient imaging ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIBIB,"METIS HEALTH ANALYTICS, LLC",R44,2021,249708,NC-04
"A prospective multiethnic HFpEF cohort from California's Central Valley ABSTRACT This is a new U01 application to establish a Clinical Center (CC) for a prospective multiethnic HFpEF cohort from California central valley for deep phenotyping analyses. The investigative team is diverse, multidisciplinary, and complementary with investigators from School of Medicine, College of Engineering and College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences. The investigative team is highly collaborative and has strong track records of previous participation in large-scale research networks involving electronic data from heterogeneous sources, including EHRs, mobile health technologies, and direct-to-participant mailings/web portals. UC Davis Heart Failure Network has one of the most diverse patient population in the country, with a large representation of Latino population from California Central Valley. Our network has an extensive catchman area with a momentous growth in patient volume. The proposed deep phenotyping will take advantage of the newly developed total-body PET scan at UC Davis to decipher the roles of organ-specific variations in metabolic syndrome and inflammation in a diverse and heterogenous HFpEF population. One unique feature of the proposed study is the use of functional connectomics analyses to directly exploit the heterogeneity in the HFpEF population. Indeed, it is the heterogeneity that provides the necessary data needed to derive the interconnections to test the critical network drivers, that will provide eventual insights into potential molecular targets for therapy as well as the unbiased classifications of subtypes of HFpEF. Finally, functional connectomics analyses enable modular “plugin” of new datasets (e.g., microbiomes), derived from deep phenotyping analyses from other CCs in the HeartShare Network.

"Leveraging artificial intelligence to develop novel tools for studying infant brain development PROJECT SUMMARY. The first 24-months of human life are dynamic, characterized by rapid growth, and increasingly recognized as crucial for establishing cognitive abilities and behaviors that last a lifetime. However, little is known about trajectories of structural and functional brain development during this sensitive period in typically developing infants, and even less is known about how deviations in these trajectories relate to emerging cognition and behavior or predict later developmental outcomes. This is partially due to current technical limitations on quantification of brain structure and function in infants via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) – an important, non-invasive approach to the study of developmental neuroscience. Currently there are insufficient methods to analyze infant MRI scans across the first 24 months of life, especially for brain segmentation – the first and critical step for virtually all quantitative analyses across MRI modalities. Without accurate and automated segmentation, infant MRI analysis is prone to systematic errors and is labor-intensive, limiting the rigor and reproducibility of infant MRI research. This limitation curtails and delays the utility of large-scale infant MRI datasets in the foreseeable future. Addressing these research gaps would significantly advance efforts toward early identification of developmental delays and/or disorders. I propose developing AI-based infant neuroimaging analysis tools for studying the early human brain development via two large-scale datasets: the NIH funded Baby Connectome Project and a centralized MRI data repository from Environmental Influence on Child Health Outcomes. In my pilot studies, I have shown the show good-to-excellent agreement with ground-truth labels from two different sources, and superior performance compared to other commonly used segmentation methods. My first aim is to develop an automated and generalizable brain segmentation pipeline with 3D convolutional neural networks – an AI approach. This segmentation tool can accommodate and process infant brain scans spanning each month over the first 2 years of life. The final AI-based pipeline will be rigorously validated internally, and tested externally. We will release the pipeline as a user-friendly, web-based interface for researchers to use in scientific community. In Aim 2, I will delineate the growth trajectories of regional brain morphometrics, major functional networks, and measure their relationships to neuropsychological functions during the first 24months of life via data from BCP. In Aim 3, I will leverage two different approaches (AI and LPCA) to predict the developmental outcomes assessed up to 3 years old. with the first-year longitudinal multimodal MRI scans from BCP. The interdisciplinary training phase of the award, conducted in the laboratory of Dr. Jonathan Posner at Columbia University, includes a comprehensive plan for the acquisition of technical and professional skills that will enable my transition to research independence. The successful completion of this project will yield reliable tools and novel data-driven methods for studying early brain developmental, fill critical knowledge gaps of early development, and advance efforts toward early identification of developmental delays and disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Little is known about the growth trajectories of brain development across the first 24-months of life because of insufficient approaches to analyze infant MRI scans especially brain segmentation. This proposal leverages artificial intelligence and large-scale datasets to address unmet technical challenges in infant brain segmentation, to delineate the growth trajectories of brain structure/function and measure their relationship with neuropsychological functions, and to predict the developmental outcomes. Results from this study will address fundamental methodological limitations and fill critical knowledge gaps of early development, advancing efforts toward early identification of developmental delays

"RADIOMIC APPROACHES TO IMPROVE TARGETING FOR ATRIAL FIBRILLATION CATHETER ABLATION PROJECT SUMMARY Although ablation to isolate pulmonary vein (PV) triggers has revolutionized atrial fibrillation (AF) management, performing effective AF ablation remains challenging. The procedure remains limited by targeting of ill-defined substrates, a 2-6% risk of major complications and limited success (single procedure 5-year success as low as 17-56%; 63-81% after the last ablation). A major recommendation of a recent NHLBI-sponsored report on the research needs and priorities for AF catheter ablation was to study how cardiac structure affects AF ablation success. There is a clear unmet need for non-invasive imaging tools to aid in improved patient selection, anatomic targeting and personalization of ablation or medical therapies. Our team has developed novel computational imaging (radiomics) methods to analyze cardiac computed tomography (CT) scans that were shown to predict the risk of recurrent AF post-ablation (AUC=0.84, N=167). These approaches included novel morphologic, fractal and atlas based features that teased out differences between PVs and the left atrial appendage (LAA), solely from analyses of CT scans. We propose to build upon our preliminary data using radiomic (computer extracted) features from radiographic images to use supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods that can analyze digitized radiographic and electro-anatomic images from the left atrium (LA) and PVs in over 2000 patients from two large AF ablation centers (Cleveland Clinic, Vanderbilt). Our project will focus on tackling the following main objectives: 1) Identify, evaluate and validate radiomic features and imaging-clinical nomograms predictive of recurrent AF after ablation; 2) Identify and validate regional radiomic sites predictive of post-ablation AF recurrence with the goal of identifying personalized targets for patients undergoing AF ablation; and 3) Identify biological correlates of radiomic features to understand the arrhythmogenic mechanisms underlying anatomic susceptibility to recurrent AF, using genomic analyses. Our 3 aims will test the following hypotheses: 1) Radiographic imaging can detect anatomic features that predict AF recurrence after ablation; 2) Regional radiomic features can predict sites that can be considered for additional ablation; and 3) Radiomic morphologic features are correlated with electroanatomic features and genomic variants associated with AF susceptibility. Tools developed will enable integration of radiographic and clinical data that may lead to improved patient selection, anatomic targeting and personalization of ablation or medical therapies. Successful project completion will yield a novel artificial intelligence-based imaging platform that can be tested for personalized targeting of AF ablation, as well as insights into the biologic basis of AF. PROJECT NARRATIVE Atrial fibrillation (AF) and its ablation remains challenging, preventing cure of the disease. This project will use artificial intelligence methods to identify regional CT imaging features with the goal of identifying personalized targets for ablation. The project will also seek to provide insights into anatomic differences between AF patients who are likely to suffer recurrence from those who are not, using genetic and electrical mapping.",RADIOMIC APPROACHES TO IMPROVE TARGETING FOR ATRIAL FIBRILLATION CATHETER ABLATION,10316365,R01HL158071,"['Affect ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Atlases ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Computers ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Pulmonary veins ', ' Recommendation ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' Diagnostic radiologic examination ', ' Conventional X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic Radiology ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray Radiology ', ' Radiography ', ' Roentgenography ', ' X-Ray Imaging ', ' X-Ray Medical Imaging ', ' Xray imaging ', ' Xray medical imaging ', ' conventional Xray ', ' diagnostic Xray ', ' diagnostic Xray radiology ', ' Cardiac ablation ', ' Catheter Ablation ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Left ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Fractals ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' auricular appendage ', ' Atrial Appendage ', ' Atrium Appendage ', ' Heart Atrium Appendage ', ' heart auricle ', ' Left atrial structure ', ' Left Atrium ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Patient Selection ', ' Genetic ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Scanning ', ' Clinic ', ' Ablation ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' voltage ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Length ', ' Nomograms ', ' Data ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Device ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Slice ', ' 4q25 ', ' Molecular ', ' Myocardial ', ' Cardiac ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' reconstruction ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' risk variant ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk allele ', ' risk gene ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk loci ', ' risk locus ', ' non-invasive imaging ', ' noninvasive imaging ', ' predictive marker ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' prognostic value ', ' prognostic ability ', ' prognostic power ', ' prognostic utility ', ' imaging platform ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' radiomics ', ' anatomic imaging ', ' anatomical imaging ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' genomic locus ', ' gene locus ', ' genetic locus ', ' ']",NHLBI,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,R01,2021,749009,OH-11
"Artificial intelligence assisted panoramic Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography for Retinopathy of Prematurity PROJECT SUMMARY The long-term goal of this project is to determine whether optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) might lead more accurate and objective diagnosis, earlier intervention, and improved outcomes in retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). International consensus and National Institute of Health (NIH) funded clinical trials over the last 30 years have defined the phenotypic classifications, natural history, prognosis, and management of ROP. However, it is well established that due to the subjectivity of the ophthalmoscopic examination, and systematic bias between examiners, there is significant variation in treatment of the most severe forms of ROP in the real world. This leads to both under-treatment (and poor outcomes due to retinal detachment) and over-treatment (exposing neonates to the ocular and systemic risks of treatment). Roughly 20,000 babies per year develop retinal detachments (RD) due to ROP and there is strong evidence that most of these are preventable. In adult retinal vascular diseases, most notably diabetic retinopathy (DR), OCT and OCTA can detect and quantify disease features such as diabetic macular edema (DME) and retinal neovascularization (NV) before they are noted clinically, enabling earlier treatment and reducing the risk of blindness from RD. However, evaluating the use of this technology in neonates requires high speed and portable technology, and the commercially available handheld OCTs are too slow for ultra-widefield (UWF) OCT and OCTA imaging. Several groups (including our own) have published preliminary results using prototype 100 to 200 kHz swept- source (SS) OCT systems, however consistent data acquisition remains challenging due to the lack of fixation and subsequent motion in an awake neonate, which has limited the evaluation of the potential benefits of the technology in this population. Recently, there has been much interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) (specifically deep learning), which relies on high speed graphics processing units (GPUs) to provide real time OCT image processing, segmentation, and tracking. This application addresses 2 fundamental gaps in knowledge: (1) Can we overcome the technical challenges through the development of a faster ultrawide-field view SS-OCT system coupled with a GPU-enabled DL software system to enable consistent data acquisition in neonates? (2) Would quantitative objective metrics of ROP improve objectivity of ROP diagnosis and detect subclinical signs of disease progression which may enable earlier intervention and improved outcomes in the future. By leveraging our institution’s OCT, AI, and ROP expertise, we will address these questions in three specific aims: (1) Develop an ultra-high speed, handheld, panoramic ultra-widefield OCT/OCTA system. (2) Develop real time GPU accelerated intelligent image acquisition software. (3) Evaluate the clinical significance OCT derived biomarkers. Successful translation of this technology to the ROP population could improve the accuracy and objectivity of ROP diagnosis, and lead to earlier intervention and improved outcomes in patients with severe ROP. PROJECT NARRATIVE Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) have proven the ability to detect subclinical disease, provide quantitative evaluation of disease progression, and improve outcomes in the leading causes of blindness in adults, age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. Technological and practical limitations have limited the application of this technology in routine use for non-sedated children undergoing routine screening for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), the leading cause of blindness in children. The proposed project will develop an ultra-high speed, handheld OCT system with graphics processing unit (GPU) enabled real-time processing to improve the feasibility of panoramic ultra-widefield OCT/OCTA imaging in non-sedated neonates and evaluate the clinical utility of OCT-derived biomarkers in ROP.",Artificial intelligence assisted panoramic Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography for Retinopathy of Prematurity,10198930,R01HD107494,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Algorithms ', ' Angiography ', ' Angiogram ', ' angiographic imaging ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Systematic Bias ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Diabetic Retinopathy ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dyes ', ' Coloring Agents ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Fluorescein Angiography ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Intelligence ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Publishing ', ' Quantitative Evaluations ', ' Retina ', ' Retinal Detachment ', ' retina detachment ', ' Retinal Neovascularization ', ' Retinopathy of Prematurity ', ' Retrolental Fibroplasia ', ' premature retinopathy ', ' Risk ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Vascular Diseases ', ' Vascular Disorder ', ' blood vessel disorder ', ' vascular dysfunction ', ' vasculopathy ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Natural History ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' Ophthalmoscopes ', ' Funduscopes ', ' improved ', ' Ophthalmic examination and evaluation ', ' Eye Exam ', ' Eye Examination ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Peripheral ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' awake ', ' diabetic ', ' Age related macular degeneration ', ' Age-Related Maculopathy ', ' age related macular dystrophy ', ' senile macular disease ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' macular edema ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' instrument ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' Severities ', ' Scanning ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' interest ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' disorder classification ', ' nosology ', ' disease classification ', ' Devices ', ' disorder of macula lutea ', ' macula abnormality ', ' macula lutea abnormality ', ' macular disease ', ' macular disorder ', ' maculopathy ', ' disorder of macula of retina ', ' Fundus ', ' portability ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Monitor ', ' sample fixation ', ' Fixation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' neovascularization ', ' neonate ', ' software systems ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Neonatal ', ' blind ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' data acquisition ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' parallel computer ', ' parallel computation ', ' parallel computing ', ' prototype ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' standard of care ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' arm ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' improved outcome ', ' Injections ', ' routine screening ', ' annual screening ', ' overtreatment ', ' over-treatment ', ' deep learning ', ' treatment risk ', ' real-time images ', ' realtime image ', ' Visualization ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NICHD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,377300,OR-03
"Transfer learning to improve the re-usability of computable biomedical knowledge Candidate: With my multidisciplinary background in Artificial Intelligence (PhD), Public Health Informatics (MS), Epidemiology and Health Statistics (MS), and Preventive Medicine (Bachelor of Medicine), my career goal is to become an independent investigator working at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Biomedicine, with a particular emphasis initially in machine learning and public health. Training plan: My K99/R00 training plan emphasizes machine learning, deep learning and scientific communication skills (presentation, writing articles, and grant applications), which will complement my current strengths in artificial intelligence, statistics, medicine and public health. I have a very strong mentoring team. My mentors, Drs. Michael Becich (primary), Gregory Cooper, Heng Huang, and Michael Wagner, all of whom are experienced with research and professional career development. Research plan: The research goal of my proposed K99/R00 grant is to increase the re-use of computable biomedical knowledge, which is knowledge represented in computer-interpretable formalisms such as Bayesian networks and neural networks. I refer to such representations as models. Although models can be re-used in toto in another setting, there may be loss of performance or, even more problematically, fundamental mismatches between the data required by the model and the data available in the new setting making their re-use impossible. The field of transfer learning develops algorithms for transferring knowledge from one setting to another. Transfer learning, a sub-area of machine learning, explicitly distinguishes between a source setting, which has the model that we would like to re-use, and a target setting, which has data insufficient for deriving a model from data and therefore needs to re-use a model from a source setting. I propose to develop and evaluate several Bayesian Network Transfer Learning (BN- TL) algorithms and a Convolutional Neural Network Transfer Learning algorithm. My specific research aims are to: (1) further develop and evaluate BN-TL for sharing computable knowledge across healthcare settings; (2) develop and evaluate BN-TL for updating computable knowledge over time; and (3) develop and evaluate a deep transfer learning algorithm that combines knowledge in heterogeneous scenarios. I will do this research on models that are used to automatically detect cases of infectious disease such as influenza. Impact: The proposed research takes advantage of large datasets that I previously developed; therefore I expect to quickly have results with immediate implications for how case detection models are shared from a region that is initially experiencing an epidemic to another location that wishes to have optimal case-detection capability as early as possible. More generally, it will bring insight into machine learning enhanced biomedical knowledge sharing and updating. This training grant will prepare me to work independently and lead efforts to develop computational solutions to meet biomedical needs in future R01 projects. Transfer learning to improve the re-usability of computable biomedical knowledge Narrative Re-using computable biomedical knowledge in the form of a mathematical model in a new setting is challenging because the new setting may not have data needed as inputs to the model. This project will develop and evaluate transfer learning algorithms, which are computer programs that adapt a model to a new setting by removing and adding local variables to it. The developed methods for re-using models are expected to benefit the public’s health by: (1) improving case detection during epidemics by enabling re-use of automatic case detectors developed in the earliest affected regions with other regions, and, more generally, (2) increasing the impact of NIH’s investment in machine learning by enabling machine-learned models to be used in more institutions and locations.",Transfer learning to improve the re-usability of computable biomedical knowledge,10158538,K99LM013383,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Communication ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' computer program ', ' computer programming ', ' Computers ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Influenza ', ' Grippe ', ' Investments ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' disease of the lung ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Parainfluenza ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Preventive Medicine ', ' preventative medicine ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Semantics ', ' Societies ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' Twin Multiple Birth ', ' Twins ', ' Universities ', ' Utah ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Unified Medical Language System ', ' UMLS ', ' base ', ' career ', ' detector ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Bayesian Method ', ' Bayesian Methodology ', ' Bayesian Statistical Method ', ' Bayesian approaches ', ' Bayesian classification method ', ' Bayesian classification procedure ', ' Bayesian posterior distribution ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Source ', ' Location ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' skills ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Health Informatics ', ' consumer informatics ', ' Public Health Informatics ', ' Institution ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Update ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' usability ', ' Bayesian Modeling ', ' Bayesian adaptive designs ', ' Bayesian adaptive models ', ' Bayesian belief network ', ' Bayesian belief updating model ', ' Bayesian framework ', ' Bayesian hierarchical model ', ' Bayesian network model ', ' Bayesian nonparametric models ', ' Bayesian spatial data model ', ' Bayesian spatial image models ', ' Bayesian spatial models ', ' Bayesian statistical models ', ' Bayesian tracking algorithms ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' Bayesian Network ', ' learning algorithm ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K99,2021,93342,PA-18
"Quantitative Prediction of Disease and Outcomes from Next Generation SPECT and CT PROJECT SUMMARY Quantitative Prediction of Disease and Outcomes from Next Generation SPECT and CT Coronary artery disease remains a major public health problem worldwide. It causes approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in the United States. Imaging of myocardial perfusion (delivery of blood to the heart muscle) by myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (MPS) allows physicians to detect disease before heart attacks occur and is currently used to predict risk in millions of patients annually. Under the current grant, we have established a unique collaborative multicenter registry including over 23,000 imaging datasets (REFINE SPECT) with both prognostic (major adverse cardiovascular events) and diagnostic (invasive catheterization) outcomes. Using this registry, we have demonstrated that a combination of MPS image analysis and artificial intelligence (AI) tools achieved superior predictive performance compared to visual assessment by experienced readers or current state-of-the-art quantitative techniques. In the renewal, we plan to expand REFINE SPECT with now-available enhanced datasets (adding CT and myocardial blood flow information) and leverage latest AI advances to provide a personalized decision support tool for patient-specific cardiovascular risk assessment and estimation of benefit from revascularization following MPS. The overall aim is to optimize the clinical capabilities of MPS in risk prediction and treatment guidance by integrating all available imaging and clinical data with state-of-the-art AI methods. For this work, we propose the following 3 specific aims: (1) To expand and enhance our REFINE SPECT registry including CT and MPS flow data, (2) To develop fully automated techniques for all MPS and CT image analysis, (3) To apply explainable deep learning time-to-event AI models for optimal prediction of MACE and benefit from revascularization from all image and clinical data. This work will result in an immediately deployable clinical tool, which will optimally predict risk of adverse events and establish the relative benefits from specific therapies, beyond what is possible by subjective visual analysis and mental integration of all imaging (MPS, CT, flow), and clinical data by physicians. Such quantitative integrative methods are not yet available, leaving the current practice for assessing risk and recommending therapy highly subjective. The precise quantitative results will be presented to clinicians in easy to understand terms (e.g., % risk per year, or relative risk of one therapy vs. the alternative) for a specific patient. Additionally, our methods to make AI conclusions more tangible will improve adoption of this technology. All results will be derived fully automatically thus eliminating any variability. Our approach will fit into current MPS practice and will be immediately translatable to clinics worldwide. Most importantly, this research will allow patients to benefit from increased precision and accuracy in risk assessment, thereby optimizing the use of imaging in guiding patient management decisions and ultimately improving outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Myocardial perfusion imaging with SPECT is often used to predict who is at risk of heart attack and should undergo treatment such as coronary bypass or stenting; however, physicians read images visually and report results with wide variability. With the latest artificial intelligence tools and new types of imaging (including CT and fast SPECT scans), the investigators propose to develop and validate an automated clinical tool to optimize risk prediction and objectively establish the relative benefit of a specific therapy. This new tool will consider all available patient images and other relevant information to provide a personalized explanation and precise calculation of risk and potential benefits from therapy for each patient.",Quantitative Prediction of Disease and Outcomes from Next Generation SPECT and CT,10110023,R01HL089765,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Calcium ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Catheterization ', ' Cathetergram ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' Coronary Artery Bypass ', ' Aortocoronary Bypass ', ' Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting ', ' Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery ', ' coronary bypass ', ' Cox Models ', ' Cox Proportional Hazards Models ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Grant ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Image Enhancement ', ' Joints ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary infarction ', ' heart attack ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart infarction ', ' Myocardium ', ' cardiac muscle ', ' heart muscle ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Perfusion ', ' Physicians ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' PET ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET imaging ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PETT ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Stents ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' tomography ', ' single photon emission computed tomography ', ' SPECT ', ' SPECT imaging ', ' Single-Photon Emission-Computed Radionuclide Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Photons ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Blood flow ', ' Visual ', ' Relative Risks ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Myocardial perfusion ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' Country ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' radiolabel ', ' radiotracer ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' attenuation ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' International ', ' Reader ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Myocardial ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' time use ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' non-invasive imaging ', ' noninvasive imaging ', ' support tools ', ' improved outcome ', ' personalized decision ', ' individualized clinical decision ', ' individualized decision ', ' personalized clinical decision ', ' personalized data-driven decision ', ' perfusion imaging ', ' Injections ', ' deep learning ', ' adverse event risk ', ' Patient imaging ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,777637,CA-28
"Development of an artificial intelligence-driven, imaging-based platform for pretreatment identification of extranodal extension in head and neck cancer Project Summary. The goal of this project is to develop, optimize, and evaluate an artificial intelligence (AI)- driven, medical imaging platform that utilizes computed tomography (CT) imaging to identify the presence of extranodal extension (ENE) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). HNSCC is a debilitating disease with significant patient-related morbidity related to the disease itself and its management, which is complex and consists of a combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. A key factor in determining proper HNSCC management is the presence of ENE, which occurs when tumor infiltrates through the capsule of an involved lymph node into the surrounding tissue. ENE is both an important prognostic factor and an indication for adjuvant treatment escalation with the addition of chemotherapy to radiation following surgery. This “trimodality therapy” is problematic, as it is associated with increased treatment-related morbidity and healthcare costs, but no improvement in disease control compared to upfront chemoradiation alone. The challenge is that ENE can only be definitively diagnosed pathologically after surgery, and pretreatment radiographic ENE identification has proven unreliable for even expert diagnosticians, leading to high rates of trimodality therapy and suboptimal treatment outcomes. In HNSCC management there is a critical need for improved pretreatment ENE identification to 1) select appropriate patients for surgery to avoid the excess morbidity and costs of trimodality therapy, 2) risk-stratify patients optimally, and 3) select appropriate patients for treatment de-escalation or intensification clinical trials. In recent years, Deep learning, a subtype of machine learning, under the umbrella of AI, has generated breakthroughs in computerized medical image analysis, at times outperforming human experts and discovering patterns hidden to the naked eye. While AI is poised to transform the fields of cancer imaging and personalized cancer care, there remain significant barriers to clinical implementation. The hypothesis of this project is that AI can be used to successfully identify HNSCC ENE on pretreatment imaging in retrospective and prospective patient cohorts and to develop a platform for lymph node auto-segmentation that will promote clinical utility of the platform. This hypothesis will be tested by rigorous optimization and evaluation of a deep learning ENE identification platform. Specifically, the platform will be validated for accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and discriminatory performance on two heterogeneous retrospective datasets and two prospective cohorts derived from institutional and national Phase II clinical trials for HNSCC patients. The platform will then be directly compared with head and neck radiologists to determine if radiologist performance can be augmented with AI. In parallel, AI will be utilized to develop an auto-segmentation platform for tumor and lymph nodes, which will 1) improve the platform's clinical impact and 2) provide a valuable tool for treatment planning and future imaging-based research for HNSCC patients. 1 Project Narrative Identification of extranodal extension (ENE) for head and neck cancer in the pretreatment setting would be extremely useful in selecting the optimal treatment strategy for patients. Currently, ENE can only be definitively diagnosed pathologically after surgery, and pretreatment radiographic ENE prediction has proven unreliable for expert diagnosticians. This project uses artificial intelligence to identify ENE pretreatment on Computed Tomography, with the goal of developing a clinically usable tool to help patients with newly diagnosed head and neck cancers and their physicians choose the most effective treatment strategy that minimizes the risk of side effects.","Development of an artificial intelligence-driven, imaging-based platform for pretreatment identification of extranodal extension in head and neck cancer",10105483,K08DE030216,"['Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biopsy ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' capsule ', ' Capsules ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' lymph nodes ', ' Lymph Node Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Lymph node proper ', ' Lymphatic nodes ', ' lymph gland ', ' lymphnodes ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Morbidity -

"Intelligent treatment planning for cancer radiotherapy PROJECT SUMMARY About 2/3 of cancer patients in US receive radiation therapy either alone or in conjunction with surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, etc. Treatment planning, where an optimal treatment strategy is designed for each individual patient and executed for the whole treatment course, is analogous to the design of a blueprint for building construction. If a treatment plan is poorly designed, the desired treatment outcome cannot be achieved, no matter how well other components of radiation therapy are performed. In the current clinical workflow, a treatment planner works towards a good quality plan in a trial-and-error fashion. Many rounds of consultation between the planner and physician are needed to reach a plan of physician's satisfaction, because physician's preference for a particular patient can hardly be quantified and precisely conveyed to the planner. Consequently, planning time can be up to a week for complex cases and plan quality may be poor and can vary significantly due to varying levels of physician and planner's skills and physician-planner cooperation, etc., which substantially deteriorates treatment outcomes. For example, head and neck (H&N) cancer patients treated with suboptimal plans present 20% lower 2-year overall survival and 24% higher 2-year local-regional failure. Prolonged overall treatment process due to treatment planning reduces local-regional control rate by 12–14% per week. Furthermore, as patient's anatomy can rapidly change within the planning time, the optimally designed plan becomes inappropriate for the changed anatomy. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has made colossal advancements. We believe that AI technologies have a great potential to revolutionize treatment planning. Treatment planning consists of two major aspects: commonality and individuality. By exploiting the commonality through deep supervised learning, we can develop a treatment plan as good as those for previously treated similar patients. The individuality can be actualized by learning physician's special considerations for a particular patient using deep reinforcement learning. Our preliminary studies have demonstrated feasibility of these ideas. We hypothesize that an AI-based intelligent treatment planning system can consistently produce high-quality treatment plans with extremely high efficiency. This hypothesis will be tested using H&N cancer patients as a test bed via two aims. Aim 1, System development. Develop two deep-learning models to realize the proposed treatment planning workflow and incorporate them into a clinical environment. Aim 2, System validation. Acquire and analyze planning data before and after system implementation. The innovation of this project is the use and customization of the state-of-the-art AI techniques to solve a clinically important problem. These technologies would revolutionize treatment planning process, leading to the efficient generation of consistently high quality plans, irrespective of human skills, experiences, and communications, etc. Besides the significance demonstrated for the H&N cancer patients, the system can be easily extended to other tumor sites, yielding more substantial impacts. NARRATIVE Treatment planning for radiation therapy, where an optimal treatment strategy is designed for each individual patient and executed for the whole treatment course, plays a central role for the success of radiation therapy treatment. The current treatment planning workflow is inefficient and produces plans with sub-optimal and varying quality, substantially deteriorating treatment outcomes. This project will use and customize the state-of- the-art artificial intelligence techniques to develop an intelligent treatment planning system that is capable of efficiently and consistently generating high quality plans.",Intelligent treatment planning for cancer radiotherapy,10190850,R01CA237269,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Arts ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Beds ', ' Communication ', ' Conceptions ', ' Consultations ', ' Curiosities ', ' Due Process ', ' Environment ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunotherapy ', ' Immune mediated therapy ', ' Immunologically Directed Therapy ', ' immune therapeutic approach ', ' immune therapeutic interventions ', ' immune therapeutic regimens ', ' immune therapeutic strategy ', ' immune therapy ', ' immune-based therapies ', ' immune-based treatments ', ' immuno therapy ', ' Individuality ', ' Intelligence ', ' Learning ', ' Medicine ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' radio-therapy ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Failure ', ' satisfaction ', ' Head and Neck Cancer ', ' Malignant Head and Neck Neoplasm ', ' head/neck cancer ', ' malignant head and neck tumor ', ' Nature ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' preference ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' treatment planning ', ' skills ', ' validation studies ', ' Modality ', ' Radiation ', ' Modeling ', ' Cancer Radiotherapy ', ' cancer radiation therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer-directed therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' head and neck cancer patient ', ' HNC patient ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' chemotherapy ', ' tumor ', ' population based ', ' treatment strategy ', ' arm ', ' Systems Development ', ' individualized medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapeutic strategy ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' individual patient ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' optimal treatments ', ' optimal therapies ', ' deep learning ', ' deep reinforcement learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' ']",NCI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,490133,TX-30
"Enhancing Assisted Reproductive Technologies with Deep Learning and Data Visualization PROJECT SUMMARY Assisted Reproduction Technology (ART) is a clinical treatment for infertile couples who want to achieve a pregnancy. In ART, embryologists fertilize eggs retrieved from the patient or a donor, culture the resulting embryos in vitro, and then transfer the selected embryo(s) to the mother's uterus. While ART is responsible for 1.9% of babies born in the United States as of 2018, selecting which embryo to transfer is a signiﬁcant challenge. The difﬁculty comes from the complexity of confounding factors and the lack of understanding of human pre-implantation embryo development. Because of this difﬁculty, multiple embryos are often transferred to increases the potential of success, resulting in multiple pregnancy rates of nearly 20%, which can lead to signiﬁcant morbidity and medical expenses to patients. The ideal is to transfer only a single embryo, but this necessitates the ability to select the best embryo from a cohort. Here, we propose to create a clinical decision support system to improve embryo selection in ART. To this end, we will develop novel deep learning models for robust embryo feature extraction and interactive data visualization methods for human-in-the-loop analysis. We will ﬁrst extract and analyze visual features from routinely collected images of embryos. We will then combine these visual features with patients' electronic health record (EHR) data to develop interpretable computation models that score embryos on their viability. We plan to integrate our machine learning solutions into an easily accessible cloud service platform that will be adaptable across clinics to improve ART embryo selection and clinical data analysis. Our research goals will be achieved by novel machine learning-based models for morphological feature extrac- tion and importance estimation of each confounding factor and a clinical decision support system for ART. For morphological feature extraction, we plan to conduct semi-supervised learning of convolutional neural networks to minimize manual labeling that requires extensive human effort. Our feature extraction model will be the ﬁrst comprehensive classiﬁcation and segmentation method for ART. To aid in embryo selection, we will develop novel deep learning-based models to predict probabilities of achieving pregnancy by accepting visual features and EHR data as the input. We will also develop visual analytic tools that allow analysts to better understand and steer these deep learning models. We will estimate the importance of each input interpretable factor in embryo selection to explain the prediction to embryologists. Finally, we will develop EmbryoProﬁler, a clinical decision support system for ART, that combines our machine learning-based models with a user-facing suite of visual analytic tools to support user guidance and clinical decision making. EmbryoProﬁler will help facilitate daily operation in clinics, foster human-guided decision making, enrich data-driven embryo analysis, and enhance the ability to select the developmentally most competent embryo for transfer to improve ART success rates. Our project will create state-of-the-art analysis approaches for ART clinicians. PROJECT NARRATIVE Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) is a widespread treatment for infertility, over 300,000 treatment cycles were performed in the US in 2018, but success rates remain low. In this project, we will develop novel machine learning algorithms and a clinical decision support system to assist embryologists in embryo selection. Our tools will also enable embryologists and biologists to obtain new information on the earliest stages of human embryo development, which will advance the fundamental science of human biology and lead to further improvements in ART practice.",Enhancing Assisted Reproductive Technologies with Deep Learning and Data Visualization,10185936,R01HD104969,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' E-learning ', ' computer-assisted instruction ', ' computer-based education ', ' computer-based instruction ', ' computer-based learning ', ' computer-based training ', ' digital education ', ' digital learning ', ' eLearning ', ' electronic learning ', ' internet-assisted education ', ' internet-based training ', ' multimedia learning ', ' on-line education ', ' on-line learning ', ' online education ', ' online learning ', ' technology-enhanced learning ', ' virtual learning ', ' web-based instruction ', ' web-based training ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Computers ', ' Couples ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Decision Making ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Embryo Transfer ', ' embryo transplantation ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Judgment ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mothers ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Patients ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy Rate ', ' Multiple Pregnancy ', ' Multiple gestation pregnancy ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' Science ', ' Time ', ' Trees ', ' United States ', ' Uterus ', ' womb ', ' zygote ', ' Fertilized Egg ', ' Fertilized Ovum ', ' Privacy ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Discipline ', ' Fostering ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Data Storage and Retrieval ', ' data retrieval ', ' data storage ', ' Cell Lineage ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' data management ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Human Biology ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Assisted Reproduction Technology ', ' assistive reproductive technology ', ' Assisted Reproductive Technology ', ' embryo cell ', ' embryo monitoring ', ' model design ', ' Blastosphere ', ' Preimplantation Embryo ', ' blastula ', ' pre-implantation embryo ', ' blastocyst ', ' Pre-implantation development ', ' Preimplantation Embryo Development ', ' Preimplantation development ', ' Pre-implantation Embryo Development ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Security ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Visualization software ', ' visualization tool ', ' analytical tool ', ' implantation ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' clinical practice ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' Secure ', ' operation ', ' cloud based ', ' data visualization ', ' microscopic imaging ', ' microscope imaging ', ' microscopy imaging ', ' Cloud Service ', ' infertility treatment ', ' fertility assistance ', ' fertility interventions ', ' fertility treatment ', ' human-in-the-loop ', ' deep learning ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' multi-task learning ', ' multitask learning ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Visualization ', ' data cleaning ', ' data cleansing ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' feature extraction ', ' data curation ', ' ']",NICHD,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,730410,MA-05
"Predicting Pulmonary and Cardiac Morbidity in Preterm Infants with Deep Learning RESEARCH SUMMARY The goal of this award is to provide Andrew Beam, PhD with research support and comprehensive mentoring designed to transition him to an independent investigator in perinatal and neonatal informatics. Preterm labor (PTL) is labor which occurs before 37 weeks of gestation and carries with it enormous health and financial consequences. Preterm infants have some of the highest levels of pulmonary and cardiac morbidity, yet machine-learning techniques for these important outcomes remains under developed. The research strategy is focused developing predictive models for two very important clinical scenarios using large sources of existing healthcare data. The focus of Specific Aim 1 develops a new form of machine learning known as deep learning for predicting PTL in pregnant women, while the focus of Specific Aim 2 investigates the use of deep learning for predicting clinical trajectories of preterm infants in the NICU. Currently, management and anticipation of both clinical scenarios is challenging and advancement in our predictive capacity could dramatically improve the quality and efficiency of the healthcare system. These models will be built using an existing database of 50 million patient-lives obtained through a partnership with a major US health insurer. Specific Aim 3 seeks to understand how the models constructed using this unique data resource translate and generalize to data from the electronic health records of Boston-area hospitals, which is a key concern for all healthcare data scientists. The education plan focuses on augmenting Dr. Beam’s graduate degrees in statistics and bioinformatics with additional training in clinical medicine and human pathology. This additional education will grant Dr. Beam a deeper understanding of the clinical problems faced by these populations and will allow for more fluid collaborations with clinicians in the future. The composition of Dr. Beam’s mentorship committee, which includes expertise in neonatology, biostatistics, and translational informatics, reflects his long-term desire to be quantitative scientist who works side-by-side practicing physicians so that quantitative research is translated into impactful clinical practice.

"Improving Virtual Gross Anatomy: Enhancing the Information Content of Cadaveric CT Scans Project Summary The long-term goal of this research is to establish a pipeline for automated image processing that enhances cadaveric non-contrast enhanced (NCE) CT data and extracts meaningful models and metrics to improve anatomy research and education. The objective is to develop the necessary toolset for this image processing, and feature extraction. The central hypothesis is that it is possible to enrich the information content of biomedical imaging data, particularly that of cadaveric NCE CT imaging, for use in gross anatomy education and research. The rationale behind this project is that cadaveric dissection, while an important part of anatomy education, is limited due to sample size, infrastructure, cost, and time. Biomedical imaging can preserve specimens for posterity and be used to supplement this material by providing statistical and quantitative information from anatomical structures. This research will attempt to establish a working pipeline for efficient information extraction through the following specific aims: (1) Improving inter-observer anatomical agreement in cadaveric CT scans; (2) Develop an approach to automatically segment anatomical structures from non-contrast enhanced CT images; and (3) Establish normal variation of anatomical structures and its relationship to pathologies. This project is innovative because it applies artificial intelligence to efficiently extract anatomical information from cadaveric NCE CT imaging, which has only been performed with traditional registration- dependent methods that often fail and are domain specific, acting on a single organ at a time. In addition, this project works with multi-species data to enhance human image data.  This project is significant because it will allow students to understand anatomical variation better by both expanding student exposure to more samples, while also extracting useful representations and analytics from these samples for education and research. The expected outcome of this project is a toolset that is capable of enhancing anatomy education and research by increasing soft-tissue contrast, automatically segmenting the kidneys, liver, mandible, and intraosseus sites of the cranial nerves, and performing statistical analysis on these organs, including but not limited to statistical shape modelling and shape analysis. This will have a positive impact on anatomical education and student retention because it will provide students with a broader range of sample variability information which will decrease pervading biases in medical training that result from small, limited sample sizes, and improve medical training. Project Narrative Dissection is a critical component of anatomy education but is limited due to the infrastructure required by the institution, the amount of variability in the available specimens, and the limited number of specimens available within the course. Biomedical imaging and analysis can be used to supplement dissection, allowing for an expansion in the number of anatomical specimens that students can observe and the amount of clinically relevant material that is available to students to improve their understanding of pathology and variation. This will expand student exposure to anatomical variation, produce more proficient medical professionals, and improve anatomy research.",Improving Virtual Gross Anatomy: Enhancing the Information Content of Cadaveric CT Scans,10141430,F31EB030904,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Blood coagulation ', ' Blood Clotting ', ' Buffaloes ', ' Cadaver ', ' Contrast Media ', ' Contrast Agent ', ' Contrast Drugs ', ' Radiopaque Media ', ' Cranial Nerves ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dissection ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Goals ', ' Image Enhancement ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Libraries ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Mandible ', ' Inferior Maxillary Bone ', ' mandibular ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Anatomic Models ', ' Anatomical Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Noise ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Students ', ' Medical Students ', ' medical school students ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Information Retrieval ', ' Information extraction ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' soft tissue ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Exposure to ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' posters ', ' programs ', ' Scanning ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' interest ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Agreement ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' bio-imaging ', ' biomedical imaging ', ' bioimaging ', ' Gifts ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Preservation Technique ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' image registration ', ' shape analysis ', ' shape description ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' demographics ', ' non-invasive imaging ', ' noninvasive imaging ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' contrast enhanced ', ' retention rate ', ' retention strategy ', ' student retention ', ' education research ', ' human imaging ', ' preservation ', ' deep learning ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' automated segmentation ', ' auto-segmentation ', ' automatic segmentation ', ' autosegmentation ', ' feature extraction ', ' segmentation algorithm ', ' ']",NIBIB,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,F31,2021,30805,NY-26
"Using Deep Learning to Predict Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocyte (iPSC-CM) Differentiation Outcomes ABSTRACT Human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) provide transformative new avenues to combat heart diseases. They have been used extensively to model disease mechanisms and predict drug responses. Despite significant advancements in iPSC-CMs differentiation, differentiation outcomes still vary across batches, cell lines, and protocols, resulting in significant experimental variability. As a result, characterizing differentiation outcomes is essential. The current standards to characterize iPSC-CM differentiation outcomes involve monitoring for functional or genetic attributes of cardiomyocytes during the differentiation. However these processes are prohibitively time consuming, imprecise, or expensive. Discovering earlier time points and scalable, accurate markers that can determine differentiation outcomes is critical for eliminating a severe bottleneck in cardiomyocyte differentiation and creating better iPSC-CM materials. Given the rising importance of iPSC-CMs in cardiovascular research, advances in iPSC-CM differentiation would widely accelerate the search for cures. Here, I propose leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI), deep learning and computer vision to develop scalable, accurate methods for characterizing and predicting iPSC-CM differentiation outcomes. To achieve this, I will first use deep learning models to identify markers and time points that can be used to predict and determine differentiation outcomes. I have differentiated iPSC-CMs and obtained a dataset of images at each day of differentiation that are labeled with their final differentiation outcome. I will analyze the dataset using a deep learning model—an image classifier—to determine the earliest time point that can be used to predict differentiation outcomes. I will then correlate results with transcriptomic data to gain mechanistic insight. To evaluate whether deep learning methods are scalable and accurate models for predicting differentiation outcomes, I will differentiate genetically diverse iPSCs lines to create an additional dataset to fine tune the model and then evaluate the model’s potential for scalability. To validate the accuracy of the model, I will first verify that the model’s predictions align with conventional functional and genetic markers of differentiated cardiomyocytes. Then, I will functionally, morphologically, and genetically compare predictions made by the model against existing methods for evaluating differentiating outcomes. Completion of this proposal will eliminate a main bottleneck in iPSC-CM differentiation; create an extensive iPSC- CM differentiation ‘morphology atlas’; and accelerate the application of AI and deep learning to iPSC-CMs. Additionally, the outlined training will provide me with the computational and regenerative medicine expertise required to later succeed as an independent investigator and physician scientist. PROJECT NARRATIVE Characterization of induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocyte (iPSC-CM) differentiation outcomes is currently prohibitively time intensive, imprecise, and expensive. The proposed studies will leverage Artificial Intelligence, deep learning, and computer vision to build a label free method to characterize and predict iPSC- CM differentiation outcomes. Completion of these studies will eliminate a main bottleneck in iPSC-CM differentiation, create a morphological atlas of the differentiation process, and accelerate the application of deep learning to the field of iPSC-CMs, all of which will result in advancements in cardiovascular research.",Using Deep Learning to Predict Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocyte (iPSC-CM) Differentiation Outcomes,10144653,F30HL156478,"['Differentiation Antigens ', ' Differentation Markers ', ' Differentiation Markers ', ' Marker Antigens ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Atlases ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Drug Modelings ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Goals ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Production ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Time ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Cardiac Myocytes ', ' Cardiac Muscle Cells ', ' Cardiocyte ', ' Heart Muscle Cells ', ' Heart myocyte ', ' cardiomyocyte ', ' insight ', ' Genetic ', ' Morphology ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Modeling ', ' Regenerative Medicine ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' Consumption ', ' transcriptomics ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' iPS ', ' iPSC ', ' iPSCs ', ' combat ', ' contrast imaging ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' drug response prediction ', ' Predict drug response ', ' cardiac tissue engineering ', ' engineered heart tissue ', ' deep learning ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F30,2021,37994,CA-18
"Clinical Biomechanics of Hip Fracture Over 300,000 hip fractures occur each year in the U.S. and up to 25% of hip-fracture patients die within a year of their injury. Despite the importance of this clinical problem, the diagnostic screening rate for osteoporosis is only 5% of the eligible population, and the sensitivity of measuring bone mineral density (BMD) by DXA, the clinical standard test for diagnosis, is only 50%. Therefore, most patients are not being screened diagnostically for osteoporosis, and for those who are, about half who will experience a hip fracture are missed. Given that the current empirical approach is inadequate, we propose to pursue a more mechanistic approach, combining state-of-the-art biomechanics and machine learning approaches. Biomechanically, the three etiological elements of hip fracture are fall risk, femoral strength, and femoral impact force. In this project, our overall goal is to provide a deeper understanding of how all three biomechanical etiological elements interact in the event of a hip fracture and from that, directly improve clinical fracture risk assessment through the use of a single predictive “Integral Biomechanical Risk (IBR)” parameter. In addition, we will also address the problem of low DXA screening rates by further developing our Biomechanical Computed Tomography (BCT) technology. This test estimates the breaking strength of the femur using finite element analysis of routine clinical CT scans previously acquired for any medical reason, and represents an improvement compared to the use of BMD alone. Since millions of patients are scanned with CT each year, this approach could double screening rates if offered as an alternative to DXA. The proposed study will investigate this biomechanical approach in a large incident hip fracture, case-cohort study (3,000 patients with hip fracture, 6,000 without). This retrospective study will include patients seen at Kaiser Permanente who had an abdominal CT scan as part of medical care prior to any hip fracture; and have standard geriatric measurements in their electronic medical records, which we will use to estimate fall risk. Specifically, our aims are to: 1) utilize electronic medical record data and CT scans to obtain patient-specific measurements related to fall risk, femoral strength, and fall severity, and 2) combine the different elements of hip fracture etiology into the IBR parameter to test the hypothesis that this metric predicts hip fracture independent of age, sex, BMI, race/ethnicity, and history of prior fracture and improves hip fracture prediction compared to the clinical standard (BMD with FRAX). Scientifically, a major novelty of this work is its use of contemporary machine learning algorithms to inform construction of a mechanistic model of the three etiological elements of hip fracture, which should better capture any interactions between these elements compared to a purely statistical-regression approach. In addition, the study cohort will be the largest and most diverse CT-based hip fracture cohort ever assembled. Importantly, positive results from this project would provide a compelling “second front” to DXA that could be quickly translated to widespread clinical practice, profoundly impacting osteoporosis care. STATEMENT OF RELEVANCE More than half of individuals who experience hip fracture do not have osteoporosis as assessed by DXA. This project draws together the latest technological advances in CT-based finite element modeling and combines it into a probabilistic model of fracture risk that uses as inputs, data typically available in medical records. By going beyond BMD, the fracture risk prediction tool developed by this work aims to significantly improve clinical fracture risk assessment and substantially impact the preventative care and treatment of osteoporosis.",Clinical Biomechanics of Hip Fracture,10144396,R01AR074958,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', ' Archives ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' bone ', ' Bone Density ', ' Bone Mineral Density ', ' Calibration ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Economics ', ' Elements ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Femur ', ' Fracture ', ' bone fracture ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hip Fractures ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' indexing ', ' Medical Records ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Osteoporosis ', ' Patients ', ' hip bone ', ' Pelvic Bones ', ' Probability ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Retrospective Studies ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Spatial Distribution ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' Translating ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Blinded ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' soft tissue ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Logistics ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' standing height ', ' Investigation ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Intramuscular ', ' experience ', ' ductile ', ' cohort ', ' kinematic model ', ' kinematics ', ' Finite Element Analyses ', ' Finite Element Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' fall risk ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' BMI ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' DEXA ', ' DXA ', ' Dual-Energy Xray Absorptiometry ', ' Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Validation ', ' sex ', ' electronic data ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' neuromuscular ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' bone strength ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Population ', ' high risk ', ' clinical practice ', ' clinical risk ', ' screening ', ' abdominal CT ', ' abdominal computed tomography ', ' biomechanical model ', ' biomechanic modeling ', ' biomechanic simulation ', ' biomechanical modeling ', ' biomechanical simulation ', ' diagnostic screening ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative care ', ' Preventive treatment ', ' Preventative treatment ', ' fracture risk ', ' clinical translation ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' patient health information ', ' patient health record ', ' patient medical record ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIAMS,"O.

"Cerebrovascular Reserve Imaging with Simultaneous PET/MRI Using Arterial Spin Labeling and Deep Learning Cerebrovascular disease remains a common cause of death and major disability in the United States, and identifying and preventing strokes should be a high priority. Direct measurement of regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) is challeng- ing in these patients, since we do not have a non-invasive, radiation-free imaging method that has been appropriately validated against gold standard techniques. This is important, because there is compelling evidence that measuring the CBF change before and after a stress test meant to increase CBF (a measurement known as cerebrovascular reserve [CVR]) can identify patients at increased stroke risk. Stress tests have been a mainstay of the diagnostic workup of cardiology patients for many years, and we believe strongly that their use will benefit cerebrovascular disease patients as well. The goal of this project is to improve the quality of arterial spin label (ASL) MRI using deep learning, a powerful form of machine learning, that is currently undergoing tremendous progress. We will then to apply this in a prospective, adaptive validation trial against oxygen-15 water PET CBF, using simultaneous PET/MRI to minimize biological variability. Finally, we will apply this improv- ed tool to study the effects of gender on CVR and its reproducibility. Successful completion of this study will result in a validated methodology to assess CVR in cerebrovascular disease patients without the use of radiation or contrast. As such, it will provide solid, evidence-based recommendations for clinicians developing new paradigms and interventions in patients with impaired CVR. There is strong evidence that imaging of cerebrovascular reserve (CVR), the ability to increase cerebral blood flow (CBF) in response to a challenge, can identify patients at increased risk of stroke. Therefore, measuring CVR would be extremely useful for designing clinical trials of interventions to mitigate this risk. However, current methods to measure CBF and CVR are suboptimal, and do not work well in patients with cerebrovascular disease. The goals of this project are • to improve non-contrast, radiation-free arterial spin label MRI methods  using deep learning, a powerful form of artificial intelligence that has  shown tremendous progress for computer vision • to validate these methods against a CBF gold-standard, oxygen-15 water  PET, using simultaneous PET/MRI, using an adaptive “play-the-winner” strategy • to apply them to assess gender differences in CVR and test their  reproducibility, with the goal of establishing age and gender normative  ranges to better identify outliers.",Cerebrovascular Reserve Imaging with

"Ultra-Fast Knee MRI with Deep Learning ABSTRACT Fast, robust and reliable quantitative knee joint MR imaging would be a significant step forward in studying joint degeneration, injury and osteoarthritis (OA). Automation of compositional and morphological feature extraction of the tissues in the knee it is an essential step for translation to clinical practice of promising quantitative techniques. It would enable the analysis of large patient cohorts and assist the radiologist/clinician in augmenting the value of MRI. Automation of several human tasks has been achieved in the last few years by the usage of Deep Learning techniques. With the availability of large amounts of annotated data and processing power, using the concepts of transforming data to knowledge by the observation of examples, supervised learning can today accomplish challenges never demonstrated before. In addition to image analysis and interpretation, Deep Learning is revolutionizing the acquisition and reconstruction aspects of the pipeline. Models can learn a direct mapping between under sampled k-space and image domain. While Deep Learning application to musculoskeletal imaging showed promising results when applied in a controlled setting, it is well understood that generalization beyond the statistical distribution of the training set is still an unmet challenge. In MRI this translates into poor performances when trained models are tested on different imaging protocols or images acquired on different MRI systems. With this proposal, we aim to leverage on this recent advancement and filling the existing gaps. We aim to study novel integrated models able to simultaneously accelerate MRI acquisition and automate the image processing that can overcome the limitation of single domain application. Fast image acquisition and accurate image post processing are typically considered to be separate problems. However, the neural networks optimization design gives us an opportunity to integrate the two to maximize both acceleration and machine-based image processing and interpretation. We will use both publicly available benchmark dataset (FastMRI) and internally collected dataset to build deep learning models able to accurately reconstruct under sampled MRI acquisitions. We will use a dataset prospectively acquired during the course of this study to validate the clinical applicability of the developed methods. Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that the proposed integrated pipeline can be applied in clinical setting for a fast and intelligent knee scan obtaining image quality comparable to standard acquisition and automated processing accuracy comparable with human reproducibility. Additionally, we propose to make our annotated image datasets and trained models a shared resource, a centralized, open evaluation platform for MRI reconstruction and image post processing techniques. NARRATIVE This study aims to use Deep Learning to simultaneously accelerate knee MRI acquisition and automate post processing pipelines including multi tissue segmentation, detection and severity staging of osteoarthritis degenerative changes.

"Deep Learning Image Analysis Algorithms to Improve Oral Cancer Risk Assessment for Oral Potentially Malignant Disorders Abstract Oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMD) are a group of mucosal diseases in the oral cavity with a risk of progressing to oral squamous cell carcinoma. Risk assessment is traditionally done through a combination of clinical and histologic evaluation. Leukoplakia is a common type of OPMD that is given a histologic grading score that is supposed to be related to its risk of progression. However, there is tremendous intra- and inter- observer heterogeneity in dysplasia grading, leading to variability and uncertainty in risk assessment and treatment planning. This also hinders the ability to study the biology of these lesions. We propose to use whole slide imaging on routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained sections in combination with deep learning methods to build a consistent risk scoring system for OPMD. Our methods will identify cell, nucleus, and tissue architectural features relevant to risk of progression in OPMD. These features will be tested in a large retrospective case-control study and then validated prospectively. We will also explore combining them with genomic and immune biomarkers in order to improve the prognostic power and explore the biolo gy of progression in OPMD. We hope that these efforts will improve and standardize risk assessment for OPMD. This could lead to improved treatment and prevention options by enabling risk stratification and allowing future clinical trials be conducted in a more uniform patient cohort. Similarly, it could improve our understanding for the biology of OPMD and the process of progression to cancer.

"Plaque Risk Stratification Using Routinely Available CCTA to Optimize Therapeutic Decision-making in Patients with Known or Suspected Coronary Artery Disease Project Summary/Abstract New treatments have been revolutionary in improving outcomes over the last 30 years, yet cardiovascular disease still exerts a $320B annual burden on the US economy. Increasing evidence is showing that Coronary CT Angiography (CCTA) may be an ideal modality to fill gaps in understanding the extent and rate of progression coronary artery disease. But despite the apparent promise of CCTA, there are barriers that prevent realizing the improvement that it theoretically provides. Currently available solutions do not overcome the barriers – a new approach is needed. Elucid Bioimaging has developed an image analysis software product vascuCAP (CAP stands for Computer Aided Phenotyping) to accurately quantify structural and morphological characteristics of plaque tissues linked to plaque rupture vulnerability. Fundamental to our approach is validated, objective quantitative accuracy; vascuCAP enjoys the most robust and well documented analytic validation of any plaque morphology software available. vascuCAP is the only system to mitigate specific issues in CT reconstruction known to effect accurate measurement of atherosclerotic plaque composition in routinely acquired CTA; it is the only system to effectively leverage objective tissue characterization validated by histology across multiple arterial beds; it achieves an effective resolution with routinely acquired CTA in the same ballpark as IVUS VH, based on solid mathematics principles that respect the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem; and it innovates by novel reporting that expresses the findings in a manner that fits efficiently into existing clinical workflows. vascuCAP has been implemented in a client-server model supporting SaaS. Working from our strong current device clearances, this research strategy is developed based on approved meeting notes from the FDA pre-submission process Phenotype classification claims to be cleared through direct De Novo pathway on the basis of accurately determining the class from in vivo CTA data relative to pathologist annotation on ex vivo specimen data. Risk prediction claims: validate ability to predict adverse events at one year, adding the IFU according to the direct De Novo pathway, One does not strictly depend on the other.This proposal is innovative in dealing with two fundamental limitations of the application of artificial intelligence and deep learning to the analysis of atherosclerosis imaging data. This proposal maximizes use of available retrospective data while putting in place the necessary structure for prospective validation and scale up. This proposal further develops vascuCAP as a tool that may reduce cost and length of clinical trials. While out of scope for this grant, it is important to also note that vascuCAP is innovative in its ability to support multi-scale modeling across cellular/molecular-level analyses and macroscopic manifestation. Also, vascuCAP’s quantitative ability makes it ideal for analysis of more advanced CT imaging protocols. These attributes complement and support the proposed objectives.

"Quantification of Liver Fibrosis with MRI and Deep Learning Project Summary/Abstract  Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in the U.S. and throughout the world. In 2017, CLD had an age-adjusted death rate of 10.9/100,000 total population and an estimated lifetime cost of fatty liver disease alone in the U.S. of ~$222 billion. Liver fibrosis (LF) is the most important and only histologic feature known to predict outcomes from CLD. The current standard for assessing LF is biopsy, which is costly, prone to sampling error, and invasive with poor patient acceptance. Thus, there is an urgent unmet need for noninvasive, highly accurate and precise diagnostic technologies for detection and quantification of LF. Our overarching objective is to apply Deep Learning (DL) methods using conventional non-elastographic magnetic resonance (MR) images, MR elastography (MRE), and clinical data to accurately detect and measure LF in children and adults with CLD, using biopsy-derived histologic data as the reference standard. In this project, we will dedicate our efforts to accomplishing the following specific aims. In Aim 1, we will develop and validate a DL framework to accurately segment liver and spleen in order to extract radiomic (gray-scale signal intensity distribution, shape and morphology, volumetry, and inter-voxel signal intensity pattern and texture) and deep features (complex abstractions of patterns non-linearly constructed throughout the transformation estimated by data-driven DL training procedures) from conventional multiparametric MRI. These features allow detection of liver and spleen structural abnormalities/tissue aberrations. In Aim 2, we will develop and validate an “ensemble” DL model (LFNet) to predict biopsy-derived LF stage and LF percentage using the integration of conventional multimodal MRI radiomic and deep features, MRE data, as well as clinical data. In Aim 3, we will develop and validate a DL model (LSNet) to quantify MRE-derived liver stiffness (LS) using conventional multiparametric MRI radiomic and deep features as well as clinical data. The proposed models will help physicians to more accurately detect and follow CLD by 1) quantifying LS from conventional MR imaging without the need for MRE; and, more importantly, 2) predicting histologic LF stage and LF percentage without the need for biopsy, while avoiding inter- radiologist variability, reducing radiologist workload, and ultimately reducing healthcare costs. We will validate the models using both internal and independent external data from various scanners and sites. The techniques we develop are expected to improve medical diagnosis and prognostication in the same way as DL has revolutionized other fields. This study will significantly impact public health because it will allow physicians and researchers to more accurately diagnose and quantify CLD and LF as well as permit more frequent assessments in a noninvasive, patient-centric manner, thus potentially improving patient outcomes while lowering healthcare costs. The techniques we develop also can be readily extended for the prediction of other important liver-related clinical outcomes, including impending complications such as portal hypertension, time to liver transplant/transplant listing, and mortality risk, among others. Project Narrative  Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a common cause of illness and death worldwide, and it is a significant healthcare and financial burden. Liver fibrosis (LF) is a measurable feature of CLD that is important to assess the severity of disease, evaluate for progression and therapy response, and predict outcomes. We propose to apply artificial intelligence methods to noninvasive conventional magnetic resonance images and readily- available clinical data for accurate detection and quantification of LF, thus significantly impacting public health by facilitating personalized therapies without the need for liver biopsy, improved outcomes, and lower healthcare costs.",Quantification of Liver Fibrosis with MRI and Deep Learning,10096229,R01EB030582,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Bilirubin ', ' Bilirubin IX alpha ', ' Biopsy ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Crowding ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Computer-Assisted Diagnosis ', ' Computer aided diagnosis ', ' computer-assisted diagnostics ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' health care expenditure ', ' healthcare expenditure ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Fatty Liver ', ' Liver Steatosis ', ' hepatic steatosis ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Portal Hypertension ', ' Laboratories ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Liver diseases ', ' Hepatic Disorder ', ' hepatic disease ', ' hepatopathy ', ' liver disorder ', ' liver transplantation ', ' Hepatic Transplantation ', ' Liver Grafting ', ' Liver Transplant ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Cyst-X: Interpretable Deep Learning Based Risk Stratification of Pancreatic Cystic Tumors Project Summary The overall goal of this project is to develop a new diagnostic tool, called Cyst-X, for accurate detection and characterization of pre-cancerous pancreatic cysts and improve patient outcome through precise decisions (surgical resection or surveillance). Pancreatic cancer is the most fatal cancer among all cancers due to its poor prognosis and lack of early detection methods. Unlike other common cancers where precursor lesions are well known (colon polyps-colon cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)-breast cancer), pancreas cancer precursors (cysts) are poorly understood. Diagnosing pancreatic cancer at earlier stages may decrease mortality and morbidity rates of this lethal disease. One major approach for diagnosing pancreatic cancer at earlier stages is to target pancreatic precancerous pancreatic neoplasms (cysts) before they turn into invasive cancer. Once cysts are detected with radiology imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), they should be characterized with respect to their malignant potential. Low-risk cysts remain harmless; hence, patients should remain under surveillance program. On the other hand, high-risk cysts can progress into an aggressive cancer, therefore, patients should undergo surgical resection if possible. Despite this, international guidelines for risk stratification of pancreatic cysts are woefully deficient (55-76% accuracy for determining characteristics of low-risk vs high risk cystic tumors, while only 40-50% accuracy detecting cysts with MRI). Combined, these critical barriers indicate that there is an urgent need for improving characterization of pancreatic cystic tumors. Based on our preliminary results, which support the development of an image-based diagnostic decision tool, we hypothesize that our proposed Cyst-X will produce higher diagnostic accuracy for characterizing pancreatic cysts and provide better patient management compared to the current guidelines. Towards this overarching hypothesis, we will first use powerful deep learning methods (specifically deep capsule networks) for automatically detecting and segmenting the pancreas and pancreatic cysts from multi-sequence MRI scans (Aim 1). Next, we will create an interpretable image-based diagnosis model for characterizing pancreatic cysts (Aim 2). Accurate characterization is necessary for such a diagnostic model; however, emphasis will also be placed on interpretability of the machine generated diagnostic model. Visual explanation of the discriminative features will help radiologists obtain higher decision rates in patient management. In Aim 3, we will validate the proposed Cyst-X framework in a multi-center study. A total of 1200 multi-sequence MRI scans will be collected from three participating clinical centers (Mayo Clinic, Columbia University Medical Center, Erasmus Medical Center). Comprehensive evaluations will be made to test the validity and generalizability of Cyst-X. All evaluations will be made with respect to the international guidelines and biopsy proven ground truths. Our proposed study has wide implications: specifically, in the long term, it will influence early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and clinical decision making to improve survival rates of pancreatic cancer. Project Narrative Unlike other common cancers for which early detection and surgical resection have reduced cancer deaths (e.g. colon polyps for colon cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ lesions and breast cancer), pancreas cancer precursors, such as commonly observed pancreatic cysts, are poorly understood. Towards the long-term goal of early detection of pancreatic cancer, our objective in this proposal is to accurately detect and characterize pancreatic cysts before they turn into aggressive cancer. The outcome of this research will be a new diagnostic tool, named Cyst-X, which will establish a better clinical strategy than the current guidelines by recommending a more selective use of invasive testing, surgery, and surveillance.",Cyst-X: Interpretable Deep Learning Based Risk Stratification of Pancreatic Cystic Tumors,10391173,R01CA246704,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biopsy ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' capsule ', ' Capsules ', ' Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' DCIS ', ' Ductal Breast Carcinoma In Situ ', ' Ductal Carcinoma In Situ ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Invasive Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Colonic Polyps ', ' colon polyp ', ' Mucinous Cystadenoma ', ' Mucinous Adenoma ', ' Mucinous Cystoma ', ' Pseudomucinous Cystadenoma ', ' Cyst ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epithelial cyst ', ' Epidermal Cyst ', ' Epidermal Inclusion Cyst ', ' Epidermoid Cyst ', ' Horn Cyst ', ' Inclusion Cyst ', ' Keratin Cyst ', ' Keratinizing Cyst ', ' Keratinous Cyst ', ' Pilar Cyst ', ' Sebaceous Cyst ', ' Goals ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Deep learning tools for the automated analysis of hematopathology whole slide images and the development of prognostic algorithms for hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The bone marrow is the primary site of hematopoiesis and its examination is central to the diagnosis and management of patients with hematological diseases. Pathology slides from clinical hematopathology services represent a treasure trove of real-world data on the biology of human bone marrow. However, human examination is time-intensive and limited in its quantitative precision, preventing our ability to perform large- scale studies or identify new morphologic markers of disease. Machine learning and image processing methods can be applied to the analysis of whole-slide images (WSIs), which will lead to improvements in our understanding of the hematological system, as well as our ability to diagnose and manage hematological diseases.  The objective of this research is to build deep learning-based tools for the automated classification of bone marrow aspirates and use these tools to study hematopoiesis in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. The central hypothesis is that automated methods can be developed for the classification, characterization, and quantification of cell morphology on human bone marrow aspirates and that these tools can identify morphologic features predictive of outcome after hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The long-term goal is to develop a suite of artificial intelligence tools for the quantitative analysis of hematopathology WSIs that can be used to improve our understanding of hematopoiesis and our management of patients with hematologic diseases through the development of digital hematopathology tools, stains, and biomarkers for research and clinical applications. This approach is innovative because it applies cutting-edge image analysis technology to the quantitative and scalable study of human bone marrow specimens from clinical pathology archives to drive discovery of new biological insights and clinical biomarkers. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our understanding of human hematopoiesis, hematological diseases and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation relies on morphologic examination of the bone marrow. Deep learning methods applied to human bone marrow whole-slide images from clinical services will improve our understanding of normal hematopoiesis and our ability to diagnose and treat hematological conditions, by enabling automated and standardized quantitation of morphologic features, which can then be applied to clinical slide archives and associated with clinical outcomes. We propose to build tools for the automated classification and morphologic characterization of normal bone marrow cells, and to apply these tools to study patients who have received hematopoietic stem cell transplants, allowing us to examine the process of hematopoiesis in human bone marrow after transplant and identify features predictive of transplant outcome.",Deep learning tools for the

"Deep learning to enable the genetic analysis of aorta Project Summary / Abstract Aortic disease is an important contributor to cardiovascular morbidity and sudden death. Key discoveries, including identification of the causal gene for Marfan’s syndrome (FBN1), have advanced our knowledge of syndromic aneurysm and dissection, but to date there remains insufficient information on sporadic thoracic aortic disease. For example, despite growing knowledge of the importance of aortic disease, there is no guideline for screening for ascending aortic disease, and no therapy to treat its underlying molecular mechanisms. While there is likely some overlap between thoracic and abdominal aortic disease, they are embryologically distinct and likely have different genetic and clinical risk factors. In Dr. Pirruccello’s preliminary work, he developed an automated deep learning model to quantify the diameter of the thoracic aorta using cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). He applied the model in the UK Biobank and conducted a genome-wide association study for the diameter of ascending and descending thoracic aorta in nearly 40,000 participants. These results cemented the feasibility of the approach of (1) training deep learning models to extract biologically relevant information from imaging, and (2) conducting genetic analyses on these deep learning model-based phenotypes. This now paves the way for a more comprehensive analysis of additional aortic traits, and downstream evaluation of genetic risk factors for both thoracic and abdominal aortic disease. First, Dr. Pirruccello proposes to develop models for additional aortic traits including thoracic aortic strain and distensibility, and abdominal aortic diameter. Second, after developing additional models to extract those features, Dr. Pirruccello proposes to conduct genetic analyses on these traits in the UK Biobank, elucidating the common and rare genetic variation that leads to variability in the aorta’s size and distensibility at several levels. Third, he proposes to produce polygenic scores, permitting modeling of the clinical and genetic risk for abnormalities in aortic size and distensibility that may predispose to aortic aneurysm and dissection. This work will take place in the Division of Cardiology at the Massachusetts General Hospital, and at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. Dr. Pirruccello will perform this research under the mentorship of Dr. Patrick Ellinor, the Director of the Cardiovascular Disease Initiative at the Broad Institute, and Dr. Mark Lindsay, an expert in genetic aortic disease at the Massachusetts General Hospital Thoracic Aortic Center. Dr. Pirruccello’s goal is to become a computational cardiovascular geneticist with expertise in machine learning. He is dedicated to becoming an independent investigator and to use the research performed for the K08 as a springboard for an R01. Project Narrative Aortic disease is an important contributor to cardiovascular morbidity and sudden death. Key discoveries, including identification of the causal gene for Marfan’s syndrome (FBN1), have advanced our knowledge of syndromic aneurysm and dissection, but to date there remains little information about the genetic basis for sporadic thoracic aortic disease.

"Dissecting the role of the direct and indirect pathways in moment-to-moment action selection. Brains transform sensory information into decisions and decisions into behaviors, which ultimately determine fitness. Behavior can be broken down into a set of discrete chunks of movement, called actions. The basal ganglia (BG) and in particular the input nucleus of the BG, the striatum, is critical for the proper sequencing and selection of actions. At a cellular level, the striatum is comprised of spiny projection neurons (SPNs) that constitute the direct pathway (dSPNs) and indirect pathway (iSPNs). Under the center-surround model of action selection, dSPNs are thought to facilitate the expression of an action while iSPNs are thought to inhibit the expression of other actions. However, it is not clear how each pathway contributes to action selection due to methodological constraints in acquiring an objectively quantitative description of behavior. Our lab has recently developed a pipeline, known as MoSeq, that acquires high-resolution behavioral data and uses an unsupervised algorithm to model stereotyped pose dynamics (actions or “syllables”). Here I propose to combine this state-of- the-art behavioral acquisition and detection technology with both cellular-resolution imaging and optogenetic perturbation to study the population dynamics underlying action selection in the striatum. I hypothesize that SPNs exhibit syllable-specific tuning, where dSPNs are tightly tuned to facilitate the expression of related syllables, while iSPNs are more broadly tuned to suppress the simultaneous expression of other syllables. I will dissect these two processes by recording and manipulating each SPN class during specific syllable expression. In aim 1, I will perform cellular-resolution recordings of the direct or indirect pathway using genetically encoded calcium indicators and miniaturized microendoscopy in the striatum. I will examine the differential roles of the direct and indirect pathways in the context of behavioral tuning. My preliminary data suggest that dSPNs are more sparsely tuned than iSPNs. In aim 2, I will functionally test the center-surround model via direct and indirect pathway inhibition. I will use the inhibitory anion-conducting rhodopsin, ACR2. Using a system capable of detecting syllable expression in real-time, I will perturb each pathway triggered upon the expression of specific syllables to compare the same selection context across many trials. In summary, the experiments proposed here will contribute to a mechanistic understanding of how the BG performs action selection on a moment-to-moment timescale. This proposal is the first to test the predictions made by the center- surround model and will advance our understanding of how the BG encodes actions. Behavior is constructed from actions that are placed into sequences that enable animals to achieve ethologically relevant goals. The striatum, the input nucleus of the basal ganglia, is critical for the proper selection and expression of actions. My work aims to understand how striatal circuits perform action selection on a moment- to-moment timescale.",Dissecting the role of the direct and indirect pathways in moment-to-moment action selection.,10238135,F31NS113385,"['Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Anions ', ' Basal Ganglia ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Endoscopes ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Methodology ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Play ', ' Population Dynamics ', ' Rhodopsin ', ' Visual Purple ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Substantia nigra structure ', ' Substantia Nigra ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Series ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' calcium indicator ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' miniaturize ', ' complement pathway ', ' Address ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Output ', ' Population ', ' optogenetics ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' microendoscopy ', ' endomicroscopy ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' Postural adjustments ', ' Postural alterations ', ' Postural changes ', ' ']",NINDS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,F31,2021,33868,MA-07
"BOND: Benchmarking based on heterogeneous biOmedical Network and Deep learning novel drug-target associations Project Summary/Abstract The applicant’s goals are to develop the necessary skills to become an independent translational biomedical informatics researcher in the area of computational drug repurposing. Exploring novel drug-target interactions (DTI) plays a crucial role in drug development. In order to lower the overall costs and uncover more potential screening targets, computational (in silico) methods have become popular and are commonly applied to poly-pharmacology and drug repurposing. Although machine learning-based strategies have been studied for years, there is no standardized benchmark that provides large-scale training datasets as well as diverse evaluation tasks to test different methods. Furthermore, the existing methods suffer from remarkable limitations, where 1) results are often biased due to a lack of negative samples, 2) novel drug-target associations with new (or isolated) drugs/targets cannot be explored, and 3) the comprehensive topological structure cannot be captured by feature learning methods . Therefore, in the era of big data, the applicant proposes a study to tackle the challenges by achieving two aims. • Aim 1 (K99 Phase): Develop a large scale benchmark for evaluating drug-target prediction based on the  generation of a multipartite network from heterogeneous biomedical datasets. • Aim 2 (R00 Phase): Adapt a deep learning model to build an accurate predictive model based on a novel  feature learning algorithm that mines the multi-dimensional biomedical network (multipartite network). In the mentored phase, the applicant will integrate heterogeneous biomedical datasets and build a benchmark for evaluation of the drug-target prediction based on well-designed strategies. The applicant will receive training in standardization tools for data integration, tools, and skills for data management, evaluation methods for drug-target predictions, and state-of-the-art machine learning/deep learning methods in computer-aided pharmacology. Complementary didactic, intellectual, and professional training will help prepare the applicant for the R00 phase where he will develop a deep learning-based predictive model and multi-dimensional graph embedding methods for feature learning. Together, these novel studies will advance the current computational drug repurposing by providing 1) comprehensive benchmarking for testing and evaluation, and 2) a scalable and accurate predictive model based on a biomedical multi-partite network. The applicant will be mentored by senior, established investigators with substantial expertise in Semantic Web, computational biology, cancer genomics, drug development, and machine learning/deep learning. Importantly, this project will provide a foundation for the applicant to establish independent research programs in 1) computational drug repurposing in real cases, 2) investigation of the diverse hidden associations in system biology (e.g., associations between drugs, genetics, and diseases), and 3) precision medicine aimed applications leveraging biomedical knowledgebases and electronic health records. Project Narrative The field of computational drug repurposing lacks a large scale benchmark that provides comprehensive and standard evaluation tasks as well as a scalable and accurate prediction model that can handle large biomedical datasets. This study aims to utilize Semantic Web technology to construct a multi-partite network based on heterogeneous biomedical databases and develop a deep learning-based predictive model based on the network.

"Virtual Biopsy with Tissue-level Accuracy in Glioma Project Summary This is a Bioengineering Research Grant (BRG) proposal in response to PAR-19-158 to further develop and validate a non-invasive panel of the most critical glioma molecular markers (IDH, 1p/19q, MGMT) using standard clinical MRI T2-weighted images and deep learning, and extend the performance to tissue-level accuracies. Currently, the only reliable way of obtaining molecular marker status is through direct tissue sampling of the tumor, requiring either a craniotomy and stereotactic biopsy or a large open surgical resection. Noninvasive determination of molecular markers with tissue-level accuracy would be transformational in the management of gliomas, reducing or eliminating the risks and costs associated with a neurosurgical procedure, accelerating the time to definitive treatment, improving patient experience and ultimately patient outcomes and survival time. Artificial intelligence such as deep learning has emerged as a powerful method for classification of imaging data that can exceed human performance. Preliminary work using our novel voxel-wise classification-segmentation approach with the NIH/NCI TCIA glioma database has outperformed any prior noninvasive methods for determination of IDH, 1p/19q, and MGMT methylation, achieving accuracies of 97%, 93%, and 95%, respectively. The approach however, needs to be validated beyond the TCIA and accuracies need to be extended in order to achieve tissue level performance. This will be accomplished by using our top-performing voxel-wise classification framework, leveraging marker-specific targeted sample sizes, and gaining a final boost from deep-learning artifact correction networks. In Aim 1 we will curate a database of over 2000 gliomas including 500 subjects from our institution, 1200 subjects from our external collaborators, and over 300 subjects from the TCIA. We will train our voxel-wise deep learning classifiers to determine molecular status based on clinical T2-weighted MR images with target accuracies of 97%. In Aim 2 we will rigorously evaluate the motion and noise sensitivity of the networks and create an artifact correction network with the goals of 1) recovering accuracies in the setting of large amounts of motion/noise and 2) further boosting accuracy to tissue-level performance even in the absence of visible artifact. In Aim 3 we will deploy a complete end-to-end clinical workflow and evaluate real-world live performance of the AI tool on 300 prospectively acquired brain tumor cases and 300 subjects from our external collaborators. The AI tool will be made available for deployment at other medical centers. The developed framework can also be extended to additional markers in a straightforward fashion. In summary, this BRG proposal will further develop, refine and validate a non-invasive MRI-based method for determining the most critical glioma molecular markers rivaling tissue-level accuracies to significantly reduce and in many cases eliminate the need for stereotactic biopsy. Project Narrative Knowledge of molecular status for a variety of markers in gliomas has moved to the forefront in clinical decision- making. This requires direct tissue sampling either from an invasive brain biopsy or open surgical resection. In this Bioengineering Research Grant proposal in response to PAR-19-158, we will develop and validate a non- invasive method to determine a panel of the most critical molecular markers (IDH, 1p/19q and MGMT methylation) with near tissue-level accuracies using routine T2-weighted (T2w) MR images and deep learning algorithms to significantly reduce and in many cases eliminate the need for stereotactic biopsy in glioma.",Virtual Biopsy with Tissue-level Accuracy in Glioma,10226632,R01CA260705,"['Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Automation ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bio-engineered ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bioengineering ', ' Biopsy ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Neoplasms ', ' Brain Neoplasia ', ' Brain Tumors ', ' tumors in the brain ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Craniotomy ', ' skull incision ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Glioma ', ' Glial Cell Tumors ', ' Glial Neoplasm ', ' Glial Tumor ', ' Neuroglial Neoplasm ', ' Neuroglial Tumor ', ' glial-derived tumor ', ' neuroglia neoplasm ', ' neuroglia tumor ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Methylation ', ' Motion ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Hyperacusis ', ' Hyperacusia ', ' Loudness Perception Disturbances ', ' Loudness Recruitment ', ' decreased loudness tolerance ', ' loudness intolerance ', ' noise sensitivity ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Sample Size ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Tumor Tissue ', ' Neurological Surgery ', ' Neurosurgical Procedures ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' response ', ' Institution ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' DNA-6-O-Methylguanine[protein]-L-Cysteine S-Methyltransferase ', ' EC 2.1.1.63 ', ' Guanine-O(6)-Alkyltransferase ', ' MGMT ', ' Methylated-DNA Protein-Cysteine Methyltransferase ', ' Methylated-DNA-Protein-Cysteine S-Methyltransferase ', ' Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase Gene ', ' O(6)-AGT ', ' O(6)-Alkylguanine-DNA Alkyltransferase ', ' O(6)-MeG-DNA Methyltransferase ', ' O(6)-Methylguanine DNA Transmethylase ', ' O(6)-Methylguanine Methyltransferase ', ' O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase ', ' O6-Alkylguanine DNA Alkyltransferase ', ' alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase ', ' methylguanine DNA methyltransferase ', ' MGMT gene ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Molecular Analysis ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Validation ', ' 19q ', ' Chromosome 19 Distal Arm ', ' Chromosome 19 Long Arm ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' prospective ', ' tumor ', ' motion sensitivity ', ' molecular marker ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' TCGA ', ' T2 weighted imaging ', ' T2 imaging ', ' T2 weighted image ', ' contrast imaging ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' mutational status ', ' mutation status ', ' virtual biopsy ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' clinical translation ', ' clinical implementation ', ' deep learning ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' surgical risk ', ' surgery risk ', ' Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine ', ' DICOM ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' learning classifier ', ' The Cancer Imaging Archive ', ' TCIA ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NCI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,655597,TX-30
"Next Generation Brain PET Imaging Abstract Gold-standard quantitative imaging studies are often difficult to implement, limited by financial and logistical issues, or expose the patient to unnecessary risks. Deep learning has shown great promise in recent years for many medical applications; one use is to synthesize improved images. Such image trans- formation methods offer the potential to improve the quality, value, and accessibility of medical imaging. The goal of this project is to develop deep convolutional neural network approaches to FDG PET imaging, the most commonly performed clinical brain- focused PET study in the USA. Using simultaneous PET/MRI, we will train networks to produce diagnostic PET images from ultra-low dose PET and MR images. We will explore the three reimbursed clinical indications for this imaging modality (tumor recurrence, dementia, and epilepsy) using both quantitative metrics and repeated reader studies to assess equivalence and evaluate possible AI generalization bias related to simultaneity, scanner type, age, gender, and disease prevalence. Next, we will evaluate whether we can move beyond ultra-low dose and remove the radiation dose altogether, synthesizing FDG brain PET images from MR inputs only, relying on the information in multi-modal functional MRI. Finally, we will assess whether we can use deep networks to combine imaging and non- imaging data such as clinical and genetic information to further improve image transformation and predict future images and image-based biomarkers. Significantly reducing or even eliminating the need for radiation to produce brain FDG PET images would be truly transformative while the ability to predict the future will enable personalized radiology and enhance our ability to perform clinical trials. Project Narrative Artificial intelligence methods, particularly deep learning, can be used to improve image quality or synthesize new images from existing data and to predict future imaging. We will apply this to determine its performance for brain metabolic imaging using simultaneous FDG brain PET/MRI in realistic clinical populations, significantly reducing or eliminating the radiotracer dose as well as incorporating non-imaging, clinical data to improve AI-based image synthesis.

"Robust quantitative MR imaging markers of response to therapy in Crohn’s Disease Project Summary: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract that has a prevalence of over 800,000 in the US alone. The economic impact is disproportionally high because it affects primarily young individuals. The characteristic periods of remission and relapse necessitate frequent hospitalizations. There has been a recent shift in clinical practice from a reactive to a proactive CD treatment strategy, recently coined as “treat-to-target”, where patients are treated to achieve not only an initial response-to-therapy, but also longer clinical remissions and improved mucosal healing. However, this approach requires the regular assessment of disease activity using objective markers enabling treatments to be tailored to the individual patient. Therefore, there is an unmet need for new tools to improve diagnostic accuracy, to quantify disease burden, and to monitor treatment efficacy. Our application in response to PAR-19-056, “Robust quantitative MR imaging markers of response to therapy in Crohn's disease” is aimed at developing and evaluating noninvasive, contrast and radiation-free quantitative imaging markers for assessing disease activity and for monitoring response to therapy. Currently available non-contrast MR imaging (MRI) sequences such as diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) and the calculated apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps are attractive but limited in providing robust and reproducible markers. Different imaging protocols or different scanners result in different ADC values. Our primary goal is to develop robust and reliable quantitative DW-MR imaging markers for the non-contrast and non-invasive assessment of CD. The proposed novel MRI acquisition and model fitting techniques will provide measurements of slow and fast diffusion as well as fraction of fast diffusion, as highly accurate, quantitative biomarkers for cell proliferation, density and size, and tissue perfusion—all indices that characterize the extent of disease activity (i.e., inflammation) in the tissue micro-structure of the bowel. To achieve this goal, we will first develop and implement an advanced distortion and motion corrected (DiMoCo) DW-MRI technique and a spatially constrained probabilistic intravoxel incoherent motion (SPIM) model to compute robust and reproducible markers. Next, we will reduce the imaging time with estimated x4 acceleration with an accelerated image acquisition and a new, advanced deep learning-based parameter estimation technique. The proposed imaging techniques and software tools will provide robust quantitative markers, thereby enabling the accurate assessment of CD activity and response to therapy. They will also reduce the need for invasive endoscopy procedures as well as the total number of other tests typically ordered for monitoring disease, effectively reducing both the disease burden and the overall cost of healthcare. Another important goal is to develop and broadly disseminate open source software that will enable the standardized evaluation of other diseases presently evaluated with DW-MRI that would benefit from the advanced diagnostic and assessment capabilities of the proposed DiMoCo SPIM-DW-MRI technique. Project Narrative: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract that impacts over 800,000 patients in the US alone, where characteristic periods of remission and relapse necessitate frequent, costly hospitalizations and symptoms such as bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, general malaise, and fever significantly compromise quality of life. There is a need for new tools aimed at the reliable assessment of disease activity by using objective markers to improve diagnostic accuracy, quantify disease burden, and monitor treatment efficacy, enabling subsequent treatments tailored to the individual patient's disease profile. The primary objective of this project is three-fold: First, to develop and validate a novel, noninvasive, contrast- and radiation-free quantitative MR imaging and image analysis technique, i.e., DiMoCo-SPIM that will generate robust and reproducible imaging markers from DW-MRI that will enable clinicians to more accurately assess bowel inflammation and response to therapy; second, to develop a machine learning technique that reduces the imaging time (x4 acceleration); and third, to make image analysis software developed in this proposal available in multiple clinical domains that presently evaluate various diseases with MRI and would benefit from the improved diagnostic and assessment capabilities of this computationally-driven technique.",Robust quantitative MR imaging

"NMR Fingerprinting: Leveraging optimal control pulse design, tailored isotope labeling, and machine learning to study intractable proteins Project summary Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is essential for the study structure, dynamics and function of proteins in near-native conditions. NMR studies have vital implications for therapeutic development. However, as the number of amino acids in the protein increases, NMR signals decay (relax) faster, yielding lower sensitivity and resolution, while the spectrum becomes more crowded. In these cases it is challenging to match observed signals to specific nuclei in the protein (called `resonance assignment') in order to meaningfully interpret NMR data. The overarching goal of our research is to push the boundaries of NMR enabling valuable insight about the dynamics and functions of currently intractable proteins. The objective of this project is to design an NMR platform consisting of coordinated, next-generation biochemical, biophysical, mathematical, and computational techniques. Our platform is built around an original approach to NMR spectroscopy in which new information about the local environment of each nucleus is encoded in the shape and pattern of its NMR signal. The rationale is that these patterns are a `fingerprint' – an intricate and unique signature that encodes key information about which atom is responsible for each resonance peak in the NMR spectrum. We will design and realize fingerprint patterns using two innovative approaches: 1) biochemically, by selectively introducing NMR-active isotopes into carefully chosen positions in the protein samples, and biophysically, and 2) by using specialized radiofrequency pulses to accurately control the quantum interactions that determine the NMR spectrum. The resulting fingerprints will be decoded using established algorithmic structures from machine learning, notably artificial neural networks. This will facilitate automated analyses that are accessible to non-NMR specialists. Our approach to spectroscopy holds promise in the study of therapeutically important proteins expressed in eukaryotic expression systems (e.g. G-protein coupled receptors and glycosylated proteins). Current NMR data from such proteins shows clear dynamics and interactions with other proteins, but cannot yet be properly interpreted because of the difficulty of relating each NMR peak to an amino acid in the protein sequence. Our platform will deliver two significant outcomes: 1) NMR resonance assignment for meaningful analyses of previously intractable systems. 2) Enable non-NMR specialists, to easily proceed from expressing their protein sample to using NMR to study dynamics and interactions via assigned spectra. This will have a positive impact on protein science and medical research. To support our mission we have assembled a team of leading experts to test our platform with their own protein systems. Project Narrative Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is used to study the structure, function, interactions, and dynamics of proteins, with important implications for therapeutic development. However, interpreting NMR information is extremely challenging and labor intensive, especially for large proteins, which produce many overlapping, weak NMR signals. We are developing next-generation methods in which key information is more clearly visible and accessible in the NMR data, using a highly coordinated platform of emerging biochemical, biophysical, mathematical, and computational techniques.","NMR Fingerprinting: Leveraging optimal control pulse design, tailored isotope labeling, and machine learning to study intractable proteins",10159285,R01GM136859,"['Algorithms ', ' Amino Acid Sequence ', ' Primary Protein Structure ', ' protein sequence ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Crowding ', ' Drug Design ', ' Environment ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Goals ', ' Isotope Labeling ', ' Isotopes ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Modernization ', ' Molecular Weight ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Proteins ', ' Relaxation ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Science ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Spectrum Analysis ', ' Spectroscopy ', ' Spectrum Analyses ', ' Vertebral column ', ' Spinal Column ', ' Spine ', ' backbone ', ' Testing ', ' Textbooks ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Medical Research ', ' Specialist ', ' HMQC ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Biochemical ', ' X-Ray Crystallography ', ' Single Crystal Diffraction ', ' X Ray Crystallographies ', ' X-Ray Diffraction Crystallography ', ' X-Ray/Neutron Crystallography ', ' Xray Crystallography ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Measurement ', ' Pyruvate ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Shapes ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Side ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Nuclear ', ' methyl group ', ' Cryo-electron Microscopy ', ' Electron Cryomicroscopy ', ' cryo-EM ', ' cryoEM ', ' Cryoelectron Microscopy ', ' nuclear power ', ' COSY ', ' TOCSY ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' G Protein-Complex Receptor ', ' G Protein-Coupled Receptor Genes ', ' GPCR ', ' G-Protein-Coupled Receptors ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Sampling ', ' NMR Spectrometer ', ' nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ', ' NMR Spectroscopy ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Protein Dynamics ', ' Resolution ', ' Therapeutic Studies ', ' Therapy Research ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Scheme ', ' protein function ', ' cost ', ' reconstruction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' quantum ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupling ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' therapeutic development ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' radio frequency ', ' radiofrequency ', ' control theory ', ' nonlinear regression ', ' non-linear regression ', ' Structural Protein ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' artificial neural network ', ' artificial neural net ', ' computational neural network ', ' synthetic neural network ', ' automated analysis ', ' ']",NIGMS,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R01,2021,445749,MA-07
"HistoTools:  A suite of digital pathology tools for quality control, annotation and dataset identification ABSTRACT: Roughly 40% of the US population will be diagnosed with some form of cancer in their lifetime. In a majority of these cases, a definitive cancer diagnosis is only possible via histopathologic confirmation using a tissue slide. Increasingly, these slides are being digitally scanned as high-resolution images for usage in both clinical and research digital pathology (DP) workflows. Our group has been pioneering the use of deep learning (DL), a form of machine learning, for segmentation, detection, and classification of various cancers using digital pathology images. DL learns features and their associated weighting from large datasets to maximally discriminate between user labeled data (e.g., cancer vs non-cancer, nuclei vs non-nuclei); a paradigm known as “learn from data”. Unfortunately, this paradigm makes DL especially sensitive to low quality slides, noise induced by small errors in the manual user labeling process, and general dataset heterogeneity. As many groups do not intentionally account for these problems, they learn that successful employment of DL technologies relies heavily on explicitly addressing challenges associated with (a) carefully curating high quality slides without preparation or scanning artifacts, (b) obtaining a large precise collection of annotations delineating objects of interest, and (c) selecting diverse datasets to ensure robust classifier performance when clinically deploying the model. To address these challenges we propose HistoTools, a suite of three modules or “Apps”: (1) HistoQC examines slides for artifacts and computes metrics associated with slide presentation characteristics (e.g., stain intensity, compression levels) helping to quantify ranges of acceptable characteristics for downstream algorithmic evaluation. (2) HistoAnno drastically improves the efficiency of annotation efforts using a combined active learning and deep learning approach to ensure experts focus only on regions which are important for classifier improvement. (3) HistoFinder aids in selecting suitable training and test cohorts to guarantee that various tissue level characteristics are well balanced, leading to increased reproducibility. Our team already has working prototypes of HistoQC (100% concordance with a pathologist, evaluated on n>1200 slides) and HistoAnno (30% efficiency improvement during annotation tasks). In this U01, we seek to further develop and evaluate HistoTools in the context of enhancing two companion diagnostic (CDx) assays being developed in our group. First, we will use HistoTools to quality control and annotate nuclei, tubules, and mitosis for improving our CDx classifier for predicting recurrence in breast cancers using a cohort of n>900 patients from completed trial ECOG 2197. Secondly, HistoTools will be employed for quality control and identification of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and cancer nuclei towards improving our CDx classifier for predicting response to immunotherapy in lung cancer using the n>700 patients from completed clinical trials Checkmate 017 and 057. These tools will build on our existing open source tool repository to aid in real-time feedback and dissemination throughout the ITCR and cancer research community. RELEVANCE: This project will result in development of HistoTools, a new digital pathology toolkit for common pre-experiment machine learning tasks in the oncology domain such as (a) timely identification of poor quality slides and slide regions, (b) quantitative metrics driving optimized cohort selection, and (c) generation of highly precise and relevant annotations. Each component is designed to directly combat an existing bottleneck in the evolving usage of digital pathology. HistoTools will significantly enhance the functionality of existing toolboxes and pipelines, facilitating increasingly sophisticated machine learning applications in oncology.","HistoTools:  A suite of digital pathology tools for quality control, annotation and dataset identification",10116983,U01CA239055,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma ', ' NSCLC ', ' NSCLC - Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' Nonsmall Cell Lung Carcinoma ', ' nonsmall cell lung cancer ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Employment ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Histology ', ' Immunotherapy ', ' Immune mediated therapy ', ' Immunologically Directed Therapy ', ' immune therapeutic approach ', ' immune therapeutic interventions ', ' immune therapeutic regimens ', ' immune therapeutic strategy ', ' immune therapy ', ' immune-based therapies ', ' immune-based treatments ', ' immuno therapy ', ' indexing ', ' Learning ', ' Lymphocyte ', ' Lymphatic cell ', ' Lymphocytic ', ' lymph cell ', ' Manuals ', ' Masks ', ' Mitosis ', ' M Phase ', ' Mitosis Stage ', ' Noise ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Paper ', ' Clinical Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Quality Control ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' Stains ', ' Staining method ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' lung cancer ', ' Active Learning ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Estrogen receptor positive ', ' ER Positive ', ' ER+ ', ' Morphology ', ' Pathologist ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scanning ', ' Slide ', ' Nuclear ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' cancer recurrence ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' photonics ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' ECOG ', ' Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ', ' International ', ' Reproducibility ', ' American Society of Clinical Oncology ', ' ASCO ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Collection ', ' Validation ', ' Preparation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' anticancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' digital ', ' imaging informatics ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' computer aided ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' open source ', ' prototype ', ' combat ', ' industry partner ', ' industrial partnership ', ' industry partnership ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' diagnostic assay ', ' companion diagnostics ', ' learning network ', ' interactive tool ', ' predicting response ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' tumor heterogeneity ', ' Intratumoral heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneity in tumors ', ' intra-tumoral heterogeneity ', ' intratumor heterogeneity ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' high resolution imaging ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' digital pathology ', ' pathology imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' Nivolumab ', ' Opdivo ', ' Visualization ', ' heterogenous data ', ' data heterogeneity ', ' data set heterogeneity ', ' dataset heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous data ', ' heterogeneous data sets ', ' heterogeneous datasets ', ' heterogenous data sets ', ' heterogenous datasets ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' The Cancer Imaging Archive ', ' TCIA ', ' Prognosis ', ' open source tool ', ' open source toolkit ', ' ']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,1,OH-11
"Constrained Disentanglement (CODE) Network for CT Metal Artifact Reduction in Radiation Therapy  ABSTRACT The World Health Organization reported that cancer is the second leading cause of death globally and is re- sponsible for 9.6 million deaths in 2018. Approximately 50% of all cancer patients receive radiation therapy (RT). Many of them have metal implants, which induce image artifacts in the treatment planning CT images and compromise or preclude treatment in an estimated 15% of all radiation therapy patients. Despite extensive CT metal artifact reduction (MAR) research it remains one of the long-standing challenges in the CT field, without a clinically satisfactory solution. The overall goal of this project is to develop cutting-edge deep learning imaging methods and software solutions for commercial CT scanners to eliminate CT metal artifacts in general and improve RT in particular. We propose a three-pronged approach to systematically tackle this challenge in three specific aims: (1) adversarial learning techniques for estimation of sinogram missing data and metal traces; (2) constrained disentanglement (CODE) networks to remove CT image artifacts during image reconstruction, through post-processing, and in both data and image domains; and (3) systematic evaluation of our proposed CT MAR techniques and clinical translation into robust RT planning methods to maximize the RT treatment planning accuracy and thus improve patient outcomes. Our synergistic track records in CT MAR research, especially with deep imaging methods over the past three years, promises an unprecedented opportunity for a brand-new solution to CT MAR. For the first time we will integrate contemporary AI innovations in data preprocessing, image reconstruction, post-processing, observer studies and treatment planning synergistically in a unified data-driven framework, positioning this project uniquely to eliminate metal artifacts and their complications in radiation therapy. This project will be pursued through the long-term academic-industrial partnership among Dr. Ge Wang at Ren- sselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), Dr. Bruno De Man at GE Research Center (GRC), and Dr. Harald Paganetti at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). While our teams will collaborate closely through the whole project, GRC has a history of CT research and translation, including direct raw data processing, and will focus on Aim 1. RPI is a pioneering group in tomographic reconstruction, especially deep-learning-based CT imaging, and will lead Aim 2. The MGH team is at the forefront of radiation therapy research and will be responsible for Aim 3. Upon completion of this project, we will have redefined the state of the art of CT MAR, largely eliminating CT metal artifacts and substantially improving radiation therapy planning and delivery accuracy. With the above-proposed networks for CT MAR, metal artifacts will have been basically eliminated, targeting residual errors <10 HU for photon and proton therapy planning, with the goal of reducing the clinical diametric error to ±3% and the proton range error due to metal artifacts to <2mm. Since our approach is software-based and open-source, the path for technology transfer and clinical translation is clearly defined, as well tested before.  NARRATIVE Metal implants induce image artifacts in treatment planning CT images, with an estimated 15% of all radiation therapy patients being seriously affected in their radiation therapy.

"TRACHOMA SURVEILLANCE AT SCALE: AUTOMATIC DISEASE GRADING OF EYELID PHOTOS PROJECT SUMMARY Trachoma is the leading cause of infectious blindness worldwide. The WHO has set a goal of controlling trachoma to a low enough level that blindness from the disease is no longer a public health concern. Control is defined as a district-level prevalence of follicular trachomatous inflammation (TF) in the upper tarsal conjunctiva of less than 5% in children, currently determined by clinical examination. While not required for the current definition, intense trachomatous inflammation (TI) correlates better with presence of the causative agent, Chlamydia trachomatis. Grading of both TF and TI vary widely between individuals, and even in the same individual over time. As cases become rarer, training new graders becomes more difficult. As areas become controlled, trachoma budgets are being cut, and the institutional knowledge of grading lost, making detection of remaining cases and potential resurgence difficult. One of the greatest obstacles to reaching our trachoma goals is an inadequate diagnostic test. The WHO relies on field grading of TF; human inconsistency, grader bias, and training costs are becoming major obstacles, but they do not need to be. We propose to test the central hypothesis that a fully automatic, deep learning grader can perform as well as trained physicians in detecting and grading trachoma. The hypothesis will be tested in the following Specific aims: 1) Automatic identification of follicles and grading of TF and 2) Automatic tarsal blood vessels detection and grading of TI. Our approach includes the development, training and testing of novel image processing pipelines based on semantic segmentation and disease classification using deep learning neural networks and state-of-the-art object detection. All of the data to be used in this study is secondary data from NEI-funded and other trachoma clinical trials conducted by our study team. We aim to facilitate widespread adoption of these novel tools across the trachoma research and grading community, by open source availability of generated code and interoperability of generated machine learning models across programming languages through use of the open neural networks exchange format. Our proposed research addresses the problem of subjectivity, cost and reliability of human trachoma grading. Successful completion of the proposed specific aims will also be a key step forward towards future study and development of providing health organizations and research teams with a novel, efficient and extensible tool to ensure objective, automated, scalable trachoma grading in the field to enhance, or in some cases replace, traditional field grading during the critical endgame of trachoma control, as well surveillance for potential resurgence. PROJECT NARRATIVE Trachoma elimination and control are major WHO goals, but success is limited by the ability to accurately identify and grade trachoma cases in the field manually by human graders, a process expensive, subjective and slow to scale up. This project seeks to perform secondary analysis by leveraging existing trachoma photograph datasets from numerous NEI-funded and other-sponsored prior randomized controlled trachoma studies in order to further develop a novel deep learning computational tool able to automatically detect and grade the active forms of trachoma in digital photographs. By employing deep learning neural networks and advanced image analysis, we propose to create a computer program with the ability to classify and grade trachoma in a way that is automatic, objective, scalable and with subsequent potential for remote grading which is auditable by regulatory agencies.",TRACHOMA SURVEILLANCE AT SCALE: AUTOMATIC DISEASE GRADING OF EYELID PHOTOS,10196816,R21EY032567,"['Adoption ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Algorithms ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Budgets ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Chlamydia trachomatis ', ' C trachomatis ', ' C. trachomatis ', ' Rickettsia trachomae ', ' Communities ', ' computer program ', ' computer programming ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' conjunctiva ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Ethiopia ', ' Eye diseases ', ' eye disorder ', ' ophthalmopathy ', ' Eyelid structure ', ' Eyelids ', ' Palpebra ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Inflammation ', ' Judgment ', ' Manuals ', ' Photography ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Programming Languages ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Semantics ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Trachoma ', ' Universities ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' density ', ' image processing ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Area ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' disorder classification ', ' nosology ', ' disease classification ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' health organization ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Conduct Clinical Trials ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' scale up ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' interoperability ', ' open source ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' secondary analysis ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' clinical examination ', ' clinical exam ', ' open source tool ', ' open source toolkit ', ' ']",NEI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R21,2021,242250,CA-12
"Perceptual integration of luminance, texture and color cues for visual boundary segmentation Project Summary One of the most essential computations performed by the visual system is segmenting images into regions corresponding to distinct surfaces. This in turn requires identifying the boundaries separating image regions, a process known as boundary segmentation. Computational analyses of natural images have revealed that many visual cues are available at region boundaries, including differences in luminance, texture, and color. It is known that these cues combine for tasks like edge localization and orientation discrimination. However, it remains unclear how these various cues are weighted and combined for boundary segmentation.  In collaborative work with Canadian colleagues at McGill University in Montreal, we have developed a novel machine learning framework for characterizing human performance on boundary segmentation tasks using naturalistic micro-pattern stimuli. Our method makes use of the Filter-Rectify-Filter (FRF) model often applied to characterizing texture boundary segmentation. The major innovation of our approach is that we fit the FRF model directly to thousands of psychophysical stimulus-response observations to estimate its major defining parameters. We have recently applied this approach to investigating spatial strategies for contrast boundary segmentation and comparing competing hypotheses of how contrast modulation is integrated across orientation channels. In this grant, we propose to apply both classical psychophysical techniques and our novel machine learning methodology to understanding the computations employed to combine luminance, texture and color cues for segmentation.  In Aim 1, we focus on modeling segmentation of luminance-defined boundaries, comparing the case where each surface has uniform luminance, giving rise to a sharp edge (luminance step), to the more naturalistic case where the two surfaces have differing proportions of dark and light micro-patterns on either side of the boundary with no sharp edge (luminance texture). We will apply our machine learning methodology to test the hypothesis that different neural mechanisms may be involved in segmenting these two different kinds of luminance boundaries. In Aim 2, we ask how observers integrate first-order (luminance) and second-order (texture) cues for boundary segmentation, and if there are differences in cue combination strategies for luminance steps and luminance textures. We will also compare models embodying competing hypotheses of the underlying neural mechanisms of cue combination. In Aim 3, we extend the analyses in Aims 1 and 2 beyond simple luminance differences to include differences in color. Finally, Aim 4 is a pedagogical aim of promoting undergraduate research. Project Narrative Segmenting natural images into regions corresponding to distinct surfaces is an essential visual task, yet the underlying computations for boundary segmentation remain poorly understood. In this project, we will apply classical psychophysical techniques and our novel machine learning methodology to understand how multiple cues, including luminance, texture, and color, combine to enable boundary segmentation. We hope to develop and test computational models of boundary segmentation, with the ultimate goal of gaining insight into the underlying neural mechanisms employed for this essential natural vision task.","Perceptual integration of luminance, texture and color cues for visual boundary segmentation",10201916,R15EY032732,"['Color ', ' Cues ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Environment ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Psychophysics ', ' psychophysical ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' Surface ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' luminance ', ' function luminance ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' computer biology ', ' Computational Biology ', ' Side ', ' Source ', ' Texture ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' stimulus/response ', ' Response to stimulus physiology ', ' interest ', ' Visual System ', ' Visual system structure ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' computer studies ', ' computational studies ', ' Outcome ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Vision research ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' vision science ', ' visual science ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergrad ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate research ', ' pedagogy ', ' laboratory curriculum ', ' lab curriculum ', ' laboratory course ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NEI,FLORIDA GULF COAST UNIVERSITY,R15,2021,374345,FL-19
"Development of FAST-DOSE assay system for the rapid assessment of acute radiation exposure, individual radiosensitivity and injury in victims for a large-scale radiological incident Summary Following a large scale radiological or nuclear event, hundreds of thousands of people may be exposed to ionizing radiation/s and require subsequent dose-dependent medical management. It will be crucial to collect and analyze human biofluids (such as blood, urine, saliva) as soon as possible within the first week for accurate dose prediction and early triage decision. There is a need for FDA-approved in vitro diagnostic high-throughput biodosimetry devices with the ability to determine past radiation exposure with precision and accuracy. At the Center for High Throughput Radiation Biodosimetry, the Columbia University Center for Medical Countermeasures against Radiation (CMCR), we have developed FAST-DOSE (Fluorescent Automated Screening Tool for Dosimetry) assay system, to measure radiation-responsive proteins in human peripheral blood samples for retrospective estimation of radiation dose. The protein panel also includes biomarkers for blood leukocyte subtypes to reflect hematological sensitivity and injury. The FAST- DOSE assay system is intended as an in vitro diagnostic device (IVD) as defined by 21 CFR 809.3. The platform uses a commercial imaging flow cytometry system (ImageStream®X) and associated Image Data Exploration and Analysis Software (IDEAS®) to rapidly quantify changes in biomarker expression levels within specific cellular structures using fluorescent imagery and algorithms for estimation of absorbed dose. The studies planned here are designed to develop and optimize our FAST-DOSE assay system to accurately estimate absorbed dose and assess hematopoietic injury in human lymphocytes after ionizing irradiation. The first objective is to build on our current biomarker validation data for early engagement with the FDA via the pre-submission process. We have used the human ex vivo model and humanized mouse (Hu-NSG) and non- human primate (NHP) models to validate biomarker expression and radiosensitivity in blood leukocytes after acute ionizing radiation exposure. The Specific Aims proposed here are designed to: optimize the assay protocol and identify biomarker dose/time kinetics for accurate dose predictions in vitro and test 1) inter-donor variation, 2) intra-donor variation and 3) inter-laboratory variability (Aim 1); test the effect of specific confounders: age and sex, inheritance with germline BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant, and inflammation and trauma on the biomarker response, before and after irradiation (Aim 2); measure biomarker levels and time kinetics in vivo and correlate with hematopoietic injury, based on peripheral blood leukocyte counts, and stem and progenitor cell levels in the bone marrow of Hu-NSG mice (Aim 3) and, develop mathematical models (using machine learning and regression techniques) to select the best FAST-DOSE biomarkers and their combinations for generating dose predictions based on the ex vivo and in vivo dose response of these biomarkers (Aim 4). Our vision for future development is to develop a more simplified, faster rapid FAST-DOSE assay system whereby the biomarkers could be developed and transitioned for use in a point-of-care (POC) device. NARRATIVE We have developed a high-throughput biodosimetry device, the FAST-DOSE (Fluorescent Automated Screening Tool for Dosimetry) assay system to measure radiation-responsive proteins in human blood leukocytes for retrospective estimation of radiation dose. Studies are designed to validate and test the performance of the blood protein biomarker panel to accurately predict absorbed dose after ionizing radiation exposure. We will correlate biomarker expression levels and time kinetics with hematopoietic injury, based on peripheral blood leukocyte counts and bone marrow toxicity in humanized mice.","Development of

"Artificial Intelligence for Assessment of Stargardt Macular Atrophy Project Abstract Stargardt disease is the most frequent form of inherited juvenile macular degeneration. Fundus autofluorescence (FAF) is a widely available imaging technique which may aid in the diagnosis of Stargardt disease and is commonly used to monitor its progression. FAF imaging provides an in vivo assay of the retinal layers, but is only an indirect measure. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), in contrast, provides three-dimensional visualization of the retinal microstructure, thereby allowing it to be assessed directly and individually in eyes with Stargardt disease. At a retinal disease endpoints meeting with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November of 2016, a reliable measure of the anatomic status of the integrity of the ellipsoid zone (EZ) in the retina, was proposed to be a potential suitable regulatory endpoint for therapeutic intervention clinical trials. Manual segmentation/identification of the EZ band, particularly in 3-D OCT images, has proven to be extremely tedious, time-consuming, and expensive. Automated objective segmentation techniques, such as an approach using a deep learning - artificial intelligence (AI) construct, would be of significant value. Moreover, Stargardt disease may cause severe visual loss in children and young adults. Early prediction of Stargardt disease progression may facilitate new therapeutic trials. Thus, this proposal develops an AI-based approach for automated Stargardt atrophy segmentation and the prediction of atrophy progression in FAF and OCT images. More specifically, we first register the longitudinal FAF and OCT enface images respectively, and register the cross-sectional FAF to OCT image. We then develop a 2-D approach for Stargardt atrophy segmentation from FAF images using an AI approach and a 3-D approach for EZ band segmentation from OCT images using a 3-D graph-based approach. Finally, an AI-based approach is developed to predict subsequent development of new Stargardt atrophy or progression of existing atrophy from the OCT EZ band thickness and intensity features of the current patient visit. Project Narrative Stargardt disease is an inherited juvenile-onset macular dystrophy that may cause severe visual loss in children and young adults, thereby causing enormous morbidity with economic, psychological, emotional, and social implications. Early prediction of Stargardt disease progression may facilitate new therapeutic trials.

"Fast Multi-dimensional Diffusion MRI with Sparse Sampling and Model-based Deep Learning Reconstruction Project Summary: Neurodegenerative disorders are a significant public health and economic problem and are the leading cause of disability worldwide. Understanding the specific degenerative processes that are actively progressing over the course of the illness is crucial for developing targeted drugs therapies and deciding treatment options. Additionally, understanding the structural connectivity changes to tease apart the specific circuitry affected is crucial in developing circuit specific non-invasive brain stimulation therapies. Diffusion- based MRI assays can provide microstructural measures that are highly sensitive to (i) the neurodegenerative processes and (ii) connectivity changes. Advanced modeling approaches can be utilized to further enhance the specificity of the microstructural measures to the underlying neurodegenerative processes. However, their utility is often limited to pure white matter regions. At the typical spatial resolution of diffusion MRI (~2mm isotropic voxel size), significant partial volume effects exist in most brain voxels (e.g., voxels with multiple tissue types, heterogenous fibers with different properties). In whole brain studies, this compromises the specificity of the disease processes identified by the advanced modeling approaches; it also contributes to inaccurate connectivity mapping. Additionally, the diffusion parameter encoding space is currently limited to one or two shells of low b-values (b<2000s/mm2), which limits the unique determination of several relevant microstructural parameters. The main objective of the proposal is the development, validation and clinical translation of a diffusion MRI assay that enable efficient encoding of diffusion parameter space at sub- millimeter voxel resolution for joint microstructure and connectivity mapping in the whole brain. Our overall hypothesis is that the proposed framework can significantly improve the validity of microstructural modeling in most brain voxels. The proposed development will make use of SNR-efficient 3D multi-slab acquisitions. Coupled with time-efficient sparse k-q sampling, the encoding will span over multiple b-shells. To allow the unique determination of several relevant microstructural parameters, multicompartmental T2 information will be utilized. The proposed developments will be enabled by two advanced reconstruction methods: structured low- rank matrix completion, a novel integrative framework for MRI reconstructions that enables several capabilities including multi-echo imaging and self-calibrating reconstruction; and model-based deep learning, a novel deep architecture to solve MR reconstruction algorithms using neural networks in a systematic fashion. These methods overcome several inefficiencies associated with extending the 3D multi-slab acquisition for multi- dimensional imaging in the k-q-TE space. To ensure scientific rigor, we will comprehensively validate our technology on dedicated diffusion phantoms along with healthy volunteers using different quantification metrics. We also validate the capability of the dMRI assay using a multi-modal MRI study in a cross-sectional study on a cohort of Huntington's disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Neurodegenerative disorders are a significant public health and economic problem affecting about 450 million people worldwide are the leading cause of disability and ill-health according to world health organization.

"Machine learning accelerated on-line adaptive replanning Abstract. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop and test a novel machine learning (ML) accelerated On-Line Adaptive Replanning (MOLAR) solution for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided radiation therapy (RT) (MRgRT). During the multi-fraction RT process, the location, shape and size of tumors and normal organs vary significantly between the fractions. These interfraction variations are among the major factors that can limit the accuracy of RT targeting. The current standard practice of image-guided RT (IGRT), developed to address the interfraction variations based on cone-beam CT (CBCT), can only correct for translational errors, and thus does not fully account for interfraction changes. To address this issue, researchers recently introduced online adaptive replanning (OLAR) that generates a new plan based on the anatomy of the day and delivers the plan for the fraction. Currently, two main obstacles affect the success of OLAR: (1) the anatomy of the day cannot be delineated accurately based on CBCT, and (2) the time required to perform OLAR is long enough to render it impractical. One way to improve the delineation accuracy is to use MRI versus CT. MRI-guided OLAR is currently being introduced into the clinics to substantially improve RT targeting. However, the bottleneck is still the impractical length of time required to segment the anatomy of the day, which can exceed 30 minutes. Furthermore, available synthetic CT (sCT) generation methods are slow or inaccurate for MRI-guided OLAR. There is no method available to quickly and objective determine when OLAR is necessary. To address these issues, we plan to develop novel techniques in the MOLAR solution. We hypothesize that the MRI-based MOLAR solution will fully account for interfraction changes, thereby substantially improving tumor targeting during RT delivery and the effectiveness of RT. Specifically, we aim to (1) develop practical ML-based solutions to quickly determine the necessity of OLAR and to rapidly generate accurate synthetic CTs; (2) develop ML-based techniques to substantially accelerate segmentation for OLAR using a progressive three-step process; and (3) verify clinical practicality and effectiveness of MOLAR by retrospectively and prospectively applying the MOLAR on MRI sets to test its speed and effectiveness in accounting for interfraction variations. We will develop this novel MOLAR solution by forging unique collaborations between clinical physicists, radiation oncologists and industry developers via an established academic-industry partnership. The successful completion of this project will enable clinicians to routinely practice “image-plan-treat”, which is the optimal solution for MRgRT. This new paradigm will fully account for interfraction variations, improve tumor targeting, reduce normal tissue toxicity, and ultimately encourage clinicians to revise the current doses and/or dose fractionations to increase therapeutic gain, enhance patient quality of life, and/or substantially save on healthcare costs. Our proposed strategy represents a drastic departure from current practice. We firmly believe that this strategy is the future of RT delivery. Project Narrative: This R01 application proposes to develop and test a novel machine learning accelerated online adaptive replanning (MOLAR) solution for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided adaptive radiation therapy through a unique academic and industry partnership.

"Machine learning-based segmentation and risk modeling for real-time prediction of major arterial bleeding after pelvic fractures PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Arterial hemorrhage after pelvic fractures is a leading reversible cause of death after blunt trauma. Prediction of arterial bleeding risk is difficult, and currently determined using subjective criteria, often based on qualitative results of admission computed tomography (CT). Segmented hematoma and contrast extravasation (CE) volumes predict need for angioembolization, major transfusion, and mortality but cannot be applied in real-time. The ill-defined multi-focal nature of pelvic hematomas and CE prevents reliable estimation using diameter-based measurements. Dr. Dreizin is a trauma radiologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. His early work has focused on improving the speed and reliability of volumetric analysis of pelvic hematomas using semi-automated techniques, and derivation of a logistic regression-based prediction tool for major arterial injury after pelvic fractures. Dr. Dreizin’s goal for this four- year K08 mentored career development award proposal is to gain the skills needed to 1) implement deep learning architectures for automated hematoma volume segmentation and 2) develop computational models for outcome prediction after pelvic trauma. These tools could greatly improve the speed and accuracy of clinical decision making in the setting of life-threatening traumatic pelvic bleeding. Fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) have emerged as the most robust and scalable method for automated medical image segmentation. Intuitive software platforms for training FCN implementations and generating multivariable machine learning models have been developed in the Python programming environment. The training objectives and research activities of this proposal are necessary to provide Dr. Dreizin with new skills and practical experience in Python programming, deep learning software, and computational modeling software. By understanding the principles and computational infrastructure behind modern machine learning, Dr. Dreizin will be able to train and validate state-of-the-art algorithms independently and effectively lead a team of researchers in this area. To achieve his goals, Dr. Dreizin has assembled a multidisciplinary team of mentors, advisors, and collaborators with world-leading expertise in computer vision in medical imaging, probability theory, data science, and comparative effectiveness research. Dr. Dreizin will focus on two specific aims. In Aim 1, he will train and validate deep learning architectures for segmentation of traumatic pelvic hematomas and CE by computing the Dice metric, time effort, and correlation with clinical outcomes. In Aim 2, he will generate and test quantitative models for predicting major arterial bleeding after pelvic trauma based on a rich multi-label dataset of segmented features.

PROJECT NARRATIVE: Hemorrhage after pelvic fractures is common after motor vehicle collisions, falls, and crush injuries, with mortality rates that range from 5-54%. The volume of hemorrhage, as measured on computed tomography (CT) scans, predicts the need for rapid intervention or transfusion, and is a strong predictor of mortality, but no automated image-processing methods exist for real-time hemorrhage volume measurement.

"Enhanced Clinical Diagnosis through Imaging and Modeling: A Machine Learning Data Fusion Framework PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In this proposal, we will use modern machine learning techniques to combine and enhance computational modeling predictions. We will overcome the physics deficiencies that are inherent in modeling assumptions by including ground-truth clinical measurements, but in turn provide predictions that are more informative (higher spatial and temporal resolution) than the original clinical measurements. Furthermore, we will implement this framework as a surrogate model that can be used in real time and can replace current models with prohibitively high computation cost. If successful, the proposed research will enable lab-to-bedside deployment of a vast array of existing and future computational models and it ultimately could lead to a paradigm shift in health care workflow.  Our overarching hypothesis is that the statistical correlations between computational models and clinical measurements can be exploited in a probabilistic data-fusion framework for more accurate predictions. Our multi-fidelity framework is based on an autoregressive Gaussian Process (GP) scheme. Our proposed scheme is a non-parametric Bayesian machine learning technique that has a probabilistic workflow and estimates uncertainty at different levels of fidelity in a principled manner.  As a template for other clinical applications, we will develop this framework for perfusion scanning of brain hemodynamics in healthy and stroke populations, which has a significant health application. In Aim 1, we will simulate cerebral perfusion in healthy and stroke populations based on CT and MR angiography (CTA and MRA) scans. We will simulate and validate cerebral blood perfusion in healthy and stroke gender-balanced subjects. In Aim 2, we construct subject-specific multi-fidelity models by combining computational results and perfusion scans. We propose to leverage the multi-fidelity model to reduce scan time and radiation exposure by incorporating simulated perfusion maps with CT perfusion scans. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this proposal we aim to combine computational simulations with clinical measurements with the goal of enhancing the accuracy of the computational models and remedy the physics deficiencies that are inherent in modeling approaches.

"Machine Learning and Control Principles for Computational Biology Summary/Abstract With our increasing ability to measure biological data at scale and the digitalization of health records, computational thinking is becoming ever more important in the biological science and healthcare. The research directions proposed in this grant look to build robust machine learning models and tool for computational biology by including principles and analysis from other engineering fields, like control, that have a proven record of incorporating robustness into the systems they have automated. This increased robustness will save resources during the development of these machine learning models. It will also lead to more reliable diagnostics, clinical tools, and machine learning based biological discoveries. We have proposed three future research directions at the intersection of machine learning, control, and computational biology (a) modeling dynamical systems, (b) robust optimization schemes (c) control principles for in vivo modeling of microbial communities. The first proposed research area involves the development of flexible models for performing inference on dynamical systems models with time-series data. Dynamical systems models are able to learn mathematically causal relationships between variables, compared to other models whose parameters may only have correlative relationships. Our flexible models will be differentiable allowing them to be trained using the same efficient algorithms and hardware that have propelled deep learning models into the spotlight. These differentiable methods will allow for us to more easily integrate the uncertainty associated with biological measurements into our models. The second research area looks to develop more robust gradient optimization algorithms, the work horse for training deep neural networks. Many of the popular algorithms used to train deep neural networks were not explicitly designed to be robust. By developing more robust optimization techniques machine learning models trained on disparate data sets at different hospital or labs will be more reproducible and will require less time for tuning parameters, ultimately saving resources as well. These robust optimization techniques will also aid in the certification of machine learning based tools that will ultimately be deployed in the clinic. The third research area we propose is an approach for the discovery and design of robust microbial communities. Communities of commensal, or engineered, bacteria have long been proposed as alternative therapies for the treatment of gut related illness (“bugs as drugs”). We propose a top down approach to identifying putative microbial consortia members from time-series experiments with germ free mice colonized by complex flora. By beginning the consortia design process in vivo we hope to overcome the challenge that many other attempts at consortia construction have encountered where in vitro designed communities do not reproduce their intended properties once transferred into living host organisms. The tools from this work will be built using open access software and all data will be made easily accessible and explorable to the public. Narrative The recent public successes of deep learning have reinvigorated computational thinking around healthcare and biology. This work develops rigorous methods and tools ensuring the efficient application of machine learning principles to computational biology. This will save resources and make these tools more reliable when they are ultimately deployed for diagnostic, research, or clinical purposes.",Machine Learning and Control Principles for Computational Biology,10276879,R35GM143056,"['Algorithms ', ' Bacteria ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Biology ', ' Certification ', ' Communities ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Engineering ', ' Grant ', ' Equus caballus ', ' Domestic Horse ', ' Equine ', ' Equine Species ', ' Equus przewalskii ', ' Horses ', ' Hospitals ', ' In Vitro ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Savings ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' computer biology ', ' Computational Biology ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' success ', ' health record ', ' member ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Alternative Therapies ', ' Data ', ' Diagnostics Research ', ' Reproducibility ', ' in vivo ', ' in vivo Model ', ' Germ-Free ', ' Scheme ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' microbial community ', ' community microbes ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' mathematical learning ', ' math learning ', ' mathematics learning ', ' computational reasoning ', ' computational thinking ', ' dynamic system ', ' dynamical system ', ' microbiota ', ' microbial consortia ', ' microbial flora ', ' microflora ', ' multispecies consortia ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' digital health ', ' ']",NIGMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R35,2021,447500,MA-07
"Patient-specific, high-sensitivity spectral CT for assessment of pancreatic cancer Abstract. The proposed project concentrates on technology developments to enable high sensitivity, bias-tolerant spectral CT for accurate quantitation of iodine concentration. Spectral CT has the potential of providing true quantitative information of tissue composition and provides an avenue for combined functional and structural imaging. High- sensitivity spectral CT accommodates anatomical sites that are traditionally hard to image, and reliable meas- urements of iodine perfusion allow additional quantitative measures such as tissue texture to aid diagnosis and clinical decision making. In the case of pancreatic cancer, the complex tumor microenvironment and the conse- quential poor perfusion characteristics lead to difficulty in diagnosis, staging, and treatment assessment. The need for visualizing low-enhancing lesions and the benefit of extracting quantitative information directly from image data strongly motivate a high-sensitivity imaging modality for reproducible iodine measurements. The need for visualizing low-enhancing lesions and the benefit of extracting quantitative information directly from image data strongly motivate a high-sensitivity imaging modality for reproducible iodine measurements. How- ever, state-of-the-art spectral CT presents large quantitation bias, i.e., inaccuracies in measured iodine concen- tration compared to the truth. We identify three major sources that contribute to quantitation bias: imaging system (e.g., spectrum mismatch), post-processing (e.g., biased estimator), and patient (scatter, beam hardening). The bias effect in current spectral CT cannot be fully eliminated by increasing radiation exposure, and has complex dependencies on the imaging system, imaging techniques, patient habitus, and processing algorithms. This in- accuracy is a major impediment to pancreatic cancer management and quantitative applications in general. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop robust, high-sensitivity spectral CT solutions that will enhance sensi- tivity and reduce variability in iodine quantitation, which in turn enables accurate, high-performance spectral biomarkers for disease management. The following specific aims will be pursued: (1) to develop an end-to-end, modular theoretical model for robust spectral CT design and optimization, (2) to develop bias-tolerant processing pipeline, and (3) to implement and evaluate high performance, hybrid spectral CT solutions on an experimental CT bench. Completion of the proposed efforts enables robust, high sensitivity spectral CT for improved tumor detection and characterization through accurate, high performance spectral biomarkers. Vendor- and spectral technology-independent outcomes of the proposal include: optimized, patient-specific protocols; post-processing pipelines that are robust against quantitative bias and variability; and the next generation spectral CT system designs for enhanced iodine quantitation. Achievements from the proposed project will improve sensitivity and quantitation accuracy of iodinated contrast media in spectral CT which enables quantitative diagnostics and treatment assessment using robust iodine biomarkers across a broad range of clinical applications. Public Health Relevance. Diagnosis, staging, and treatment assessment of pancreatic cancer is severely challenged by the difficulty to delineate and reproducibly measure pancreatic lesions as a result of low-enhancement from contrast agents. We propose to develop high-sensitivity, low-bias spectral CT technology to enhance low concentration iodine visualization and mitigate system-dependent variability to allow quantitative image biomarkers as additional in- dicators for diagnosis and treatment efficacy. The technology developed in this work can be widely applied to improve quantitative accuracy of spectral CT applications, and facilitate robust clinical translation of novel spec- tral biomarkers for general disease management.","Patient-specific, high-sensitivity spectral CT for assessment of pancreatic cancer",10296757,R01EB030494,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biological Products ', ' Biologic Products ', ' Biological Agent ', ' biopharmaceutical ', ' biotherapeutic agent ', ' Calibration ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Contrast Media ', ' Contrast Agent ', ' Contrast Drugs ', ' Radiopaque Media ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' Hybrids ', ' Iodine ', ' Joints ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Noise ', ' Pancreas ', ' Pancreatic ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Physics ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' Tweens ', ' Vendor ', ' Work ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' X-Ray Radiation ', ' X-ray ', ' Xray ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' detector ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Lesion ', ' Measurement ', ' Staging ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' Malignant Pancreatic Neoplasm ', ' Pancreas Cancer ', ' Pancreatic Cancer ', ' pancreatic malignancy ', ' Malignant neoplasm of pancreas ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' Texture ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Radiation Dose ', ' Radiation Dose Unit ', ' Performance ', ' tech development ', ' technology development ', ' attenuation ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' FDG PET ', ' fluorodeoxyglucose PET ', ' fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ', ' Computed Tomography Scanners ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Contrast-Enhancing Lesion ', ' Gadolinium-Enhancing Lesion ', ' Gd-Enhancing Lesion ', ' Enhancing Lesion ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Characteristics ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' tumor microenvironment ', ' cancer microenvironment ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' tumor ', ' public health relevance ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' 3D Print ', ' 3-D print ', ' 3-D printer ', ' 3D printer ', ' 3D printing ', ' three dimensional printing ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' contrast enhanced ', ' spectrograph ', ' spectral image ', ' spectral imagery ', ' spectrum image ', ' spectrum imagery ', ' imaging system ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' Radiation exposure ', ' clinical translation ', ' perfusion imaging ', ' imaging approach ', ' imaging based approach ', ' denoising ', ' de-noising ', ' Visualization ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,643028,PA-03
"Deep Learning of Pancreas MRI to Predict Progression of T1D. Project Summary The TrialNet Pathway to Prevention study has provided crucial early screening for relatives of individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D). The presence of autoantibodies conveys high risk for progression from Stage 1 T1D, defined by the presence of multiple diabetogenic autoantibodies, to Stage 3 T1D, or symptomatic disease. However, the time to progression can be variable. A variety of genetic and metabolic indices have attempted to predict progression of T1D, with varying degree of success. Additional biomarkers are needed to improve prediction of progression, and these biomarkers must be correlated with immunological markers or metrics that assess beta cell function. The overall goal of the proposed study is to establish an imaging biomarker to predict progression. We propose to improve T1D prediction by 1) co-registering longitudinal MRI taken during progression of T1D to identify spatial evolution characteristic of disease evolution, 2) harnessing deep learning techniques to identify image features characteristic of the pancreas in T1D, and 3) integrated imaging and functional metrics to build a predictive model of T1D progression. This work builds upon work we have performed indicating that pancreas size, shape, and structure are altered in new onset type 1 diabetes. These imaging metrics are also altered in individuals at risk for developing T1D. This study will identify imaging features characteristic of the pancreas that accompany progression to T1D. The techniques developed may prove useful for monitoring patients at risk for T1D and predicting progression to symptomatic disease, which is associated with lower incidence of diabetic ketoacidosis at diagnosis, better glycemic control, and corresponding improvements in long-term complications. The ability to predict progression would further facilitate the design of new therapeutic trials which are shorter and less expensive by stratifying patient populations and providing intermediate end points. Project Narrative This proposal seeks to build a model that predicts progression of type 1 diabetes (T1D) incorporating quantitative pancreas MRI. The model will integrate longitudinally-acquired imaging metrics assessing pancreas size, shape, and structure with functional assays of beta cell function.

"Predictive Markers and Mechanisms of Persistent Psychotic-like Experiences in Children: An Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study Analysis PROJECT TITLE Predictive Markers and Mechanisms of Persistent Psychotic-like Experiences in Children: An Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study Analysis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT My long-term career goal is to establish a highly influential and independent research program and become a broad spectrum leader and innovator in computational psychiatry. I therefore propose the following training goals: 1) To gain formalized training in computational psychiatry methods and statistics, including deep learning and structural equation modeling, 2) to obtain a deeper understanding of the field of developmental psychopathology, and 3) to acquire training in developing and sustaining an independent investigator position with his own laboratory. To meet the first goal, I will meet regularly with University of California Davis (UCD) faculty co-mentors Ian Davidson and Emilio Ferrer, attend relevant UCD classes, and complete a Research Plan with the following Specific Aims: 1) Using deep learning from Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study data (demographic/clinical information, neurocognitive testing, neuroimaging data, and environmental metrics), predict child psychotic-like experience (PLE) distress scores the following year (i.e., baseline data predicting year one PQ-BC distress, year one data predicting year two distress, etc.), and 2) Using rules-based guidance from deep learning using explainable AI (XAI) algorithms, use sequential, structural equation modeling (SEM) of latent profiles (i.e., longitudinal trajectories, e.g., emerging, absent, remitting, persistent) to test hypotheses regarding the longitudinal mechanism(s) which may lead to persistent PLEs in the ABCD cohort. In Aim 1, XAI methods will be used identify the rules used by the deep learner to make decisions; in Aim 2, these rules will then be used to create latent constructs for modeling profiles of longitudinal trajectories. If r2>0.80 is consistently achieved for each iterative analysis in Aim 1, it suggests that ABCD instruments may predict PLE severity one year after measurement at a potentially clinically implementable level and help generate future hypotheses for personalized interventions aimed at reducing risk for persistent PLE distress. For Aim 2, insight will be gained with regard to how brain structure, brain function, neurocognitive ability, and environmental influences interact to influence the time course of PLE expression. To meet the second goal, I will receive mentoring including guided readings via monthly meetings with co-mentor Dr. Ellen Leibenluft, a world-renowned psychiatrist specializing in developmental research and Section Chief at the NIMH. I will also attend developmental classes, seminars, and workshops offered by UCD. To meet the third goal, I will attend weekly meetings with mentor Dr. Cameron Carter, from whom I will gain overarching career guidance. This will include learning how to create and oversee a laboratory, obtaining recommendations for society memberships, acquiring networking opportunities, securing grant sponsorships, and receiving RCR-related guidance. I will also attend mentoring and grantsmanship workshops offered by UCD, attend an off-campus workshop providing hands-on activities to provide exposure to fundamental management skills, complete a formalized UCD RCR plan, and gain mentoring experience by advising a research assistant and postdoc. PROJECT NARRATIVE Child psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) are common disturbances of perception and ideation that occur in childhood and that (if they become persistent) may be risk factors for poor mental health in adolescence and beyond. As risk factors that predict persistent PLEs have not been reliably identified, the goal of this study is to use deep learning combined with explainable artificial intelligence to identify features from multimodal data in the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study dataset that predict future levels of PLE distress, and then use these features to model PLE trajectories using structured equation modeling. The results of this study will help develop novel, personalized ways to prevent persistent PLEs from developing and ultimately improve mental health.",Predictive Markers and Mechanisms of Persistent

"Novel Computed Tomography (CT) Imaging Biomarkers in Older Adults for Predicting Adverse Geriatric Health Outcomes Blood-based biomarkers have been widely used in studying various metabolic pathways contributing to aging, including energy metabolism, chronic inflammation, cellular senescence, and endothelial function. Like blood- derived biomarkers, imaging-based biomarkers can be evaluated as potential predictors of aging outcomes. For study of non-neurologic aging, biomarkers derived from computed tomography (CT) offer great promise. Recent advances in scanner technology and image processing mean that most CT examinations can be obtained in less than one minute, lowering participant burden. In addition, radiation doses have been lowered and the intra- and inter-scanner variability has improved. In parallel, machine learning tools allow for automated image processing and segmentation, increasing efficiency of image analysis, and reducing bias. For these reasons, CT is increasingly being used to study skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. On CT, muscle quantity is typically measured by cross-sectional area (CSA). Muscle quality is traditionally quantified by skeletal muscle density (SMD) and intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) cross-sectional area. In addition to being a measure of muscle quality, IMAT may be considered as a measure of fat quantity. We recently developed and validated an automated machine learning tool to determine traditional CT measures of muscle and adipose tissue quantity and quality. To better characterize tissue quality, we have also applied ""radiomic"" texture analysis to muscle tissue on CT images. Texture analysis refers to the quantification of image voxel inter-relationships and provides a measure of tissue heterogeneity. To our knowledge, this technique has never been applied to CT images from community-based epidemiological studies. We propose to relate these CT-based assessments of muscle and adipose tissues to important geriatric outcomes, focusing on hip and other fractures as well as falls, physical performance, and strength. We will complete these analyses on archived CT images in MrOS (a prospective cohort study of healthy aging in older men, with a particular focus on osteoporosis) and Health ABC (a prospective cohort study of non-disabled Black and White older adults). Abdominal CT images were collected at the baseline exam for MrOS men in the United States (N~3700 in 2000-2), MrOS men in Hong Kong (N~400 in 2001-3), and Health ABC (N~3000 in 1997-8). Health ABC also collected CT images at the mid-thigh. In Health ABC, mid-thigh and abdominal CT images were repeated in a subset five years later (N~600 in 2000-3). We will add three aims: 1) test the hypothesis that that greater muscle and fat tissue heterogeneity features at the abdomen and mid-thigh are associated with increased risk of hip and other fractures, 2) test the hypothesis greater muscle and fat tissue heterogeneity features at the abdomen and mid-thigh are associated with lower strength and poor physical performance (walking speed and chair stands); their decline over time; and risk of falls, and 3) characterize changes in muscle and fat tissue heterogeneity features at the mid-thigh over 6 years. In this secondary data analysis project, we proposed to measure muscle and adipose tissue quality and quality with automated, machine learning algorithms on existing CT images previously collected as part of the MrOS and Health ABC studies. Further, we will derive novel, radiomic based measures of texture of muscle and adipose tissue, and relate all of these metrics to important adverse geriatric outcomes in older adults.",Novel Computed Tomography (CT) Imaging Biomarkers in Older Adults for Predicting Adverse Geriatric Health Outcomes,10303313,R21AG070804,"['Abdomen ', ' Abdominal ', ' Adipose tissue ', ' Fatty Tissue ', ' adipose ', ' white adipose tissue ', ' yellow adipose tissue ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Archives ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cell Aging ', ' Cell Senescence ', ' Cellular Aging ', ' Cellular Senescence ', ' Replicative Senescence ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Endothelium ', ' Energy Metabolism ', ' Energy Expenditure ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Fracture ', ' bone fracture ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Heart ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hip region structure ', ' Coxa ', ' Hip ', ' Hip Fractures ', ' Hong Kong ', ' Hongkong ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Inflammation ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' mortality ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Osteoporosis ', ' Patients ', ' Pelvis ', ' Pelvic ', ' Pelvic Region ', ' Phenotype ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thigh structure ', ' Thigh ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' base ', ' density ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Skeletal Muscle ', ' Voluntary Muscle ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scanning ', ' Texture ', ' Techniques ', ' Musculoskeletal ', ' skeletal ', ' Radiation Dose ', ' Radiation Dose Unit ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' fall risk ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Outcome ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' older men ', ' healthy aging ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' clinical risk ', ' predictive marker ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' abdominal CT ', ' abdominal computed tomography ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' Physical Performance ', ' walking speed ', ' walking pace ', ' radiomics ', ' blood-based biomarker ', ' blood-based marker ', ' Prospective cohort study ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' ']",NIA,CALIFORNIA PACIFIC MED CTR RES INSTITUTE,R21,2021,213676,CA-12
"Quantitative MRI of Multiple Sclerosis - Resubmission - 1 Project Summary  In this project, we propose a novel T1 and T2 quantification method that generates quantitative T1 or T2 maps from weighted MR images. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is commonly used as a tool to diagnose Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and track lesional changes over time. Because MRI has various contrasts that display different information about the underlying tissue microstructure and physiology, it can potentially be used as a tool to predict MS disease progression and even disability. However, there is no known measure derived from MR images of MS that correlates well with clinical disability as described by the Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS). Previous efforts to correlate MRI features and EDSS have included calculating total lesion load on T1- and T2-weighted images, measuring the variations in the magnetic transfer ration of normal-appearing brain tissues, and calculating cerebral atrophy, each with a varying level of success. Yet, there has been little study of the evolution of relaxation times of the lesions over time and how it relates to disability. Because changes in the T1 (spin-lattice) and T2 (spin-spin) relaxation times of a tissue can reflect pathological changes in that tissue over time, quantitative T1 and T2 maps derived from MR images may be more indicative of microscopic changes that manifest as disability in MS patients.  The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) develop and validate novel T1 and T2 quantification method on spin-echo MR images, (2) extend the novel quantification method to common MS imaging sequences, and (3) apply the novel quantification method to MS datasets to predict EDSS using machine learning. Aim 1 will involve the validation of the quantification pipeline on both T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo MR images in vivo, resulting in a range of acceptable parameters for the novel quantification method. Aim 2 will extend the quantification pipeline to include commonly used and more complicated MS imaging sequences, again resulting in a range of acceptable parameters for the quantification method. Aim 3 will use the quantification pipeline to compare machine learning algorithms with and without quantification to determine the added value of quantification in the imaging of MS. Additionally, Aim 3 will result in a predictive machine learning model utilizing multiple imaging contrasts for the prediction of disability in MS. These results will provide a more thorough understanding of the role of MR quantification in the evaluation of neurological diseases, such as MS, and will offer a scientific foundation to extend the use of MR quantification as a potential imaging biomarker for other diseases and pathologies. Project Narrative The proposed research aims to develop and validate a T1 and T2 quantification method using internal reference values derived from T1- or T2-weighted MR images. This method will be applied to weighted images of patients who have been diagnosed Multiple Sclerosis and input into various classification algorithms to determine which method is most predictive of worsening clinical disability as described by the Expanded Disability Status Score. By doing this, we will determine the impact of this novel quantification method as a tool for both the analysis of patients with Multiple Sclerosis as well as a tool for the normalization of big MR datasets before being input into machine learning algorithms.",Quantitative MRI of Multiple Sclerosis - Resubmission - 1,10316992,F31NS118930,"['Affect ', ' Axon ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cerebrospinal Fluid ', ' cerebral spinal fluid ', ' spinal fluid ', ' Demyelinations ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Evolution ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Foundations ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Inflammation ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Multiple Sclerosis ', ' Disseminated Sclerosis ', ' insular sclerosis ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' Reference Values ', ' Reference Ranges ', ' Relaxation ', ' Research ', ' ROC Curve ', ' ROC Analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic curve ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Microscopic ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Lesion ', ' disability ', ' cerebral atrophy ', ' brain atrophy ', ' cortical atrophy ', ' Recovery ', ' Disease Progression ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Attenuated ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Dependence ', ' Scanning ', ' subdermal ', ' subcutaneous ', ' Techniques ', ' brain tissue ', ' Equation ', ' magnetic ', ' Magnetism ', ' success ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Modeling ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict treatment response ', ' therapy prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' Predictive Value ', ' in vivo ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' digital ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Coupled ', ' healthy volunteer ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' in vivo imaging ', ' imaging in vivo ', ' contrast enhanced ', ' T2 weighted imaging ', ' T2 imaging ', ' T2 weighted image ', ' contrast imaging ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' multiple sclerosis patient ', ' MS patient ', ' patients with MS ', ' patients with multiple sclerosis ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' classification algorithm ', ' Patient imaging ', ' data harmonization ', ' harmonized data ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,F31,2021,45686,IL-01
"IEEE Medical Imaging Conference Abstract  The IEEE Medical Imaging Conference (MIC) is the leading international scientific meeting bringing together a broad community interested in the physics, engineering and mathematical aspects of medical imaging, with special emphasis on nuclear medicine and multi-modal systems. The MIC runs in conjunction with the IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium (NSS) and the Workshop on Room Temperature Semiconductor X-ray and Gamma-ray Detectors (RTSD).  The purpose of the MIC is to disseminate and foster new research in physics and bio-engineering methods in medical imaging. While the traditional topics of primary interest are related to nuclear medicine techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT), increasing space will be also given to recently evolving imaging modalities such as X-ray, CT, optical, MR, with special emphasis on their multi-modal combination with nuclear medical imaging. Recently there has also been additional interest in employing deep learning and AI to enhance the field medical imaging. The conference provides a well-established forum of scientific exchange and dialogue between researchers in academia, industry, and government as well as education of the public, with special emphasis on young generations. This is reflected by the large spectrum of educational refresher sessions and short courses. One of the major objectives of the conference is the education of young investigators, and therefore this NIH R13 proposal seeks $10,000 in funding for each of the next three years to provide 20 trainee grants of $500 each to partially cover costs of MIC conference registration, housing and/or short course fees for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows based at US institutions.  We anticipate that the main impact of this grant program will be to increase attendance of students and postdocs at the 2020 meeting, especially those typically underrepresented, as well as to support their participation in educational activities. It is important to bring young generations, especially women, minorities, and those with disabilities, into the medical imaging field, where they could become main actors in the coming years. They will attend plenary and oral presentations given by many of the world leaders in the nuclear medical imaging instrumentation, image processing, and quantitative analysis fields. Moreover, they will be given the unique opportunity of direct personal interaction through the short courses and dedicated poster presentations. In turn their work will be exposed to the other participants for critical evaluation, constructive suggestions and dissemination. Furthermore, many of these trainees will likely continue in this field, thereby contributing to advancing technology with high societal relevance as being increasingly used in the clinical management of disease and therapeutic interventions. Narrative  The IEEE Medical Imaging Conference (MIC) has the purpose to disseminate and foster new research in physics and bio-engineering methods in medical imaging. The conference covers a variety of medical imaging topics including quantitative imaging, PET/SPECT techniques, image reconstruction, imaging in radiation therapy, portable imaging, multi-modality systems, new medical imaging technologies, CT/MR/optical/ultrasound, parametric/kinetic image modeling, and signal/image processing and modeling. One of the major objectives of the conference is the education and encouragement of young investigators, and therefore this NIH R13 proposal seeks funding to provide twenty grants for each of the next three years to graduate students and postdoctoral fellows based at US institutions to partially cover costs of MIC conference registration and short course fees.",IEEE Medical Imaging

"Deep learning approaches to decipher the impact of mobile element insertion on alternative splicing in neurological disorders The purpose of this training and research application is to study the functional impact of mobile element insertions (MEIs) in neurological disorders (NDs) using new developments in deep learning techniques. MEIs are transposable DNA fragments that are able to insert throughout the human genome. There are at least 124 independent MEIs associated with human diseases. Approximately 20% of these diseases represent a spectrum of NDs, yet the overall contribute of MEIs to the etiology of NDs has not been systematically estimated. To address this, we will (1) characterize functional MEIs in GTEx cohorts in healthy individuals; (2) build a comprehensive functional map of MEIs to determine tissue-specific and brain-specific impact; and (3) impute transcriptional changes on various NDs where whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data will be generated. The proposed application will also develop an extensive research program for Dr. Dadi Gao, a computational biologist and statistical geneticist who has trained in functional genomic studies of alternative splicing in neurodegenerative disorders and therapeutic targeting of a splicing defect that causes a severe neurodevelopmental disorder. He has developed novel methods to investigate regulation of the transcriptome and to facilitate analyses in drug development. He now seeks to expand his expertise by applying statistical and deep learning models on large cohorts of sequencing data from controls and cases with NDs from post-mortem tissues, then impute functional consequences of MEIs from WGS in large-scale disease cohorts. The training plan consists of two years of mentored research to learn new skills in genome analysis, MEI characterization, and advanced deep learning techniques, followed by three years of shaping an independent laboratory. The research plan is developed to comprehensively explore functional variation in the genome by decomposing transcriptomic changes against MEIs. Dr. Michael Talkowski at Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard, and the Broad Institute will serve as the primary mentor, while Dr. Manolis Kellis at MIT and the MIT Computational Biology Group, and the Broad Institute will serve as a co-mentor and close collaborator. These mentors are recognized experts in genomic structural variants, functional genomics, the genetics of neurological disorders, and computational modeling to establish functional elements in the human genome. In addition, a team of independent investigators from basic and translational research will provide Dr. Gao with comprehensive feedback to keep both his science and career development on track. The highly collaborative environment in CGM, MGH, Harvard Medical School, the Broad Institute and the University of Michigan Medical School will prepare Dr. Gao for his transition to an independent investigator. This outstanding mentorship team and training program will facilitate the career development of Dr. Gao as he seeks to redefine the functional maps of MEIs in the human genome and to impute their impact in large-scale neurological disorders. Mobile element insertions (MEIs) represent a largely undefined component of the genetic architecture of neurological disorders, as a number of MEIs have been associated with alternative splicing in these disorders but large-scale genome-wide functional characterization has not been systematically performed across tissues. This program study will functionally characterize the impact of MEIs on alternative splicing from whole-genome sequencing and transcriptome sequencing in large cohorts using new developments in deep learning models. These results will enhance our understanding of the etiological role and pathogenic mechanisms associated with MEIs in neuronal development and human neurological disorders.",Deep learning approaches

We remain focused on and committed to expansion of an engaged, knowledgeable, and high performing CT workforce, refinement of proficient and innovative infrastructure to support CT research and science and removing all impediments to the performance of research. Our long-standing mission to foster a borderless, collaborative, and synergistic research and research training environment for our multi-institutional translational workforce, our community stakeholders and health system members to advance the clinical/translational science research and improve the health of our community, our nation, and beyond continues to drive our direction. We remain committed to working within the CTSA consortium to learn from our colleagues across the nation and to contribute to the growing body of knowledge in the CT field. The tri-lateral mutually learning ecosystem formed by our workforce, the community, and the health system shapes the framework for strategically moving forward and has led to the concept developed in this application of integrated clinical and research ensembles (ICREs) in which patients, clinical investigators, translational researchers, health system representatives, community members, population ambassadors, basic scientists, clinicians and others are brought together. We will further expand our outreach into the communities we serve, reaching deeper into underserved communities, and will incorporate CT research across the life span to pediatric, geriatric and underrepresented populations. In the end, our goal is to use our hard-earned experience and extended capabilities to address the unmet health needs of our patients and our community while persevering to advance our infrastructure and workforce development programs to meet the standards of the developing field of translational science and research. Page 166 Project Summary/Abstract Contact PD/PI: SHAKER, REZA NONE  Project Narrative Our community is in need of better preventive measures, more accurate diagnostics and more effective and efficient therapies. We offer a novel and comprehensive mechanism to address this need through research and education. We propose to create a mutually learning ecosystem that coalesce a myriad of requisite stakeholders including health systems, research enterprises and the community in southeast Wisconsin to work in tandem towards solutions that improve the health outcomes of our citizens.

"Algorithms for programming DBS systems for Essential Tremor PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT Essential tremor (ET) is the most common movement disorder in the United States, affecting 4% of all adults over the age of 40. For individuals whose motor symptoms are refractory to medication and significantly impair their daily living, deep brain stimulation (DBS) is considered to be the only bilateral therapeutic option. Despite recent advances in DBS technology, a significant portion of ET patients with DBS implants will receive inadequate tremor control because of poorly placed DBS leads, while others will lose efficacy of the therapy after 1-2 years due in part to inflexible neurostimulator programming options. There is a strong and growing clinical need for implantable DBS lead designs and programming algorithms that can enable clinicians to better sculpt electric fields within the brain, especially in cases where stimulation through a poorly placed DBS lead results in low-threshold side-effects. Our proposed study will integrate high-field magnetic resonance imaging, histological neurotracing of fiber pathways, computational modeling of DBS, and single-cell electrophysiology methods to further develop and experimentally-validate a novel semi-automated machine learning algorithm that facilitates hypothesis-driven determination of subject-specific neurostimulator settings through directional DBS leads. Specifically, we will: 1) identify the neural pathways involved in the reduction of action and postural tremor using directional DBS leads and a novel particle swarm optimization algorithm based on subject-specific anatomy; 2) quantify how tremor-related information is modulated on the single-cell, population, and network levels by therapeutic DBS in a preclinical large-animal model of harmline-induced tremor; and 3) investigate how therapeutic windows (i.e. the threshold difference between postural and action tremor abolishment and side effect emergence) change over time with human DBS therapy targeting one or more pathways within the cerebello-thalamoc-cortical network. Together, this project will (a) experimentally evaluate and translate a novel DBS programming algorithm to human ET patients, (b) provide a much more detailed map of the neural pathways underlying the therapeutic effects of DBS (on postural and action tremor) and side effects of DBS (on dysarthria, paresthesia, ataxia), (c) rigorously investigate how DBS for treating tremor works mechanistically at the single cell and network levels within the brain, and (d) probe the neural pathways involved in the worsening of tremor symptoms for ET patients over time. NARRATIVE Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a proven therapy for patients with medication-refractory essential tremor, but a significant portion of patients with these implants do not receive adequate tremor control because of poorly placed DBS leads or inflexible DBS programming options. There is a strong and growing clinical need for implantable DBS lead designs that can enable clinicians to better sculpt electric fields in the brain to improve the functional outcome for all patients requiring DBS to manage their essential tremor. Our research study will experimentally evaluate a novel machine learning algorithm for programming directional DBS leads implanted within thalamus to more precisely identify and effectively target the pathways and circuits involved in (a) cessation of action and postural tremor, and (b) worsening of tremor symptoms over time.",Algorithms for programming DBS systems for Essential Tremor,10246791,R01NS081118,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Ataxia ', ' Ataxy ', ' Coordination Impairment ', ' Dyssynergia ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cerebellar Cortex ', ' Cerebellar Nuclei ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Dysarthria ', ' Dysarthosis ', ' Electric Stimulation ', ' Electrical Stimulation ', ' electrostimulation ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Grant ', ' Harmaline ', ' Dihydroharmine ', ' Harmidine ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Movement Disorders ', ' Dyskinesia Syndromes ', ' Movement Disorder Syndromes ', ' Neural Pathways ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Paresthesia ', ' Patients ', ' Posture ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Research ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Tremor ', ' United States ', ' Utah ', ' Work ', ' Dentate nucleus ', ' nucleus dentatus ', ' zona incerta ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Medial ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Refractory ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Fiber ', ' insight ', ' Intention Tremor ', ' Action Tremors ', ' Individual ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' Bilateral ', ' Funding ', ' Essential Tremor ', ' Benign Essential Tremor ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' electric field ', ' instrument ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Deep Brain Stimulation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' magnetic field ', ' particle ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' Radiation ', ' Modeling ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Brain region ', ' Symptoms ', ' Motor ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Therapeutic Effect ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Output ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Impairment ', ' somatosensory ', ' Implant ', ' deep brain stimulation array ', ' arm ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' motor symptom ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' side effect ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' automated algorithm ', ' automatic algorithm ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2021,542822,MN-05
"Malarial retinopathy screening system for improved diagnosis of cerebral malaria Summary Cerebral malaria (CM) is a life-threatening clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection. In 2018, malaria affected more than 213 million people in Africa alone and claimed 381,000 lives, more than 65% of whom were African children less than 5 years old. As a consequence of the high incidence of CM, it is often misdiagnosed for other pathologies with similar symptoms, leading to a high false positive rate for CM, incorrect treatment, and resulting mortality or neurological disability. The specificity of the current standard of care for clinical diagnosis of CM (physical symptoms, coma, and malaria parasite test such as rapid diagnostic testing) is reported around 61%. Therefore, there is a significant market need for a highly specific, low-cost, and easy-to-use test to improve CM diagnosis and save lives. Since Malarial retinopathy (MR) is greater than 95% specific to the presence of CM, retinal screening for MR represents an effective means to assist in and improve the specificity of CM diagnosis. Screening for MR in addition to the current standard of care improves the specificity of CM diagnosis from 61% to 100%. VisionQuest Biomedical has developed ASPIRE, the first fully automated MR detection software integrated with a low-cost and portable retinal camera, a system that can be operated by minimally trained personnel such as medical technician or nurse without the need of an ophthalmic specialist. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team of regulatory consultants, commercialization experts, business development specialists, and clinicians; to clinically deploy and launch ASPIRE in our target market in Africa. This team will validate and prepare ASPIRE for regulatory clearance as well as finalize the marketing and commercial rollout strategy. In Phase II-B, the research team at VisionQuest Biomedical deployed a fully-functional clinical version of ASPIRE and tested it in nine malaria clinics in Africa, which demonstrated excellent performance and usability for detecting MR, without the need of an ophthalmic expert. In CRP, ASPIRE will be validated for technical and clinical performance and will be brought to commercial readiness with regulatory clearance. We will accomplish this through four specific aims. In the first aim, the software system for MR detection will be validated to bring it under design controls. In the second aim, we will deploy ASPIRE at 25 clinics in Africa to demonstrate safety and efficacy as well as to promote market traction. The third aim will focus on preparing ASPIRE for regulatory submission. In the fourth aim, we will complete African healthcare market research for a startup market of 5 countries (Malawi, Zambia, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda) and finalize marketing and rollout strategy. Within one year after CRP, our goal will be to deploy ASPIRE in more than 200 malaria clinics across 5 countries in Africa. Narrative Cerebral malaria (CM) is a life-threatening clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection, which claims hundreds of thousands of lives of African children every year. The detection of retinal biomarkers of CM, called malarial retinopathy, can improve the diagnostic accuracy of CM. This project proposes the development, clinical deployment, and commercialization of a fully automated malarial retinopathy detection system consisting of a low-cost retinal camera and automatic malarial retinopathy detection software.",Malarial retinopathy screening system for improved diagnosis of cerebral malaria,10253474,SB1AI162452,"['Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Coma ', ' Comatose ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Kenya ', ' Malaria ', ' Paludism ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Cerebral Malaria ', ' Malawi ', ' Nyasaland ', ' Market Research ', ' Marketing ', ' Medical Device ', ' Medicine ', ' mortality ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Parasites ', ' Pathology ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Research ', ' Retina ', ' Retinal Diseases ', ' Retinal Disorder ', ' retina disease ', ' retina disorder ', ' retinopathy ', ' Rwanda ', ' Ruanda ', ' Safety ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Validation ', ' Software Verification ', ' Specificity ', ' Syndrome ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Traction ', ' Uganda ', ' Work ', ' Zambia ', ' Northern Rhodesia ', ' Businesses ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Specialist ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' disability ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' African ', ' Policies ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Letters ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Health Care Markets ', ' Healthcare Market ', ' Consult ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' research study ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' Reporting ', ' portability ', ' Institution ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Symptoms ', ' Detection ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' cost ', ' software systems ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' clinical research site ', ' clinical site ', ' 5 year old ', ' 5 years of age ', ' age 5 years ', ' five year old ', ' five years of age ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' usability ', ' commercialization ', ' standard of care ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' verification and validation ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' IRB ', ' IRBs ', ' screening ', ' malaria infection ', ' malaria-infected ', ' malarial infection ', ' physical symptom ', ' smartphone Application ', ' Android App ', ' Android Application ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smartphone App ', ' iOS app ', ' iOS application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iPhone Application ', ' Rapid diagnostics ', ' detection platform ', ' detection system ', ' ']",NIAID,VISIONQUEST BIOMEDICAL INC,SB1,2021,999158,NM-01
"Distance-based ab initio protein structure prediction Project Summary Predicting the three-dimensional structures of proteins without using known structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) as templates (ab initio) remains a grand challenge of computational biology. Whereas template-based modeling is now a mature field, ab initio modeling is a comparatively nascent one, especially for large proteins with complex topologies and multiple domains. The need for advances in ab initio modeling is evident. A lot of protein sequences do not have (recognizable) templates in the PDB, and the pace of experimental structure determination is incommensurate with the scale of the problem. Herein, we propose a new approach to ab initio modeling that consists of novel deep learning architectures to predict inter- residue distances and domain boundaries as well as robust, iterative optimization methods to construct tertiary structures from the predicted distances. This project builds on the success of our current R01, particularly the outstanding performance of the Cheng group in the 2018 worldwide protein structure prediction experiment – CASP13 – where our MULTICOM suite ranked among the top three tertiary structure predictors, alongside Google DeepMind’s AlphaFold. The methods will be implemented as open-source tools for the emerging field of distance-based ab initio protein structure modeling. We will apply the methods to study protein homo-oligomers and self-assemblies, based on our novel discovery that the quaternary structure contacts within homo-oligomers can be predicted by deep learning methods from the co-evolutionary signals embedded in multiple sequence alignments of protein monomers. Furthermore, we will apply the methods to predict the folds, functional sites, superfamilies, and protein-protein interactions of proteins that contain “essential Domains of Unknown Function” (eDUFs), a group of evolutionarily conserved, essential proteins that represents an important uncharted region of protein function/fold space. The predictions for a diverse and representative subset of eDUFs will be experimentally validated through a unique collaboration with the structural biology group of Dr. Tanner. Project Narrative Three-dimensional protein structure information is indispensable in modern biomedical research, but experimental techniques will only resolve a small fraction of known proteins due to the considerable cost. This project will develop cutting-edge computational methods based on modern artificial intelligence (AI) technology to reliably predict protein structures from sequence information alone. The prediction tools will be applied through collaborations with experimental scientists and disseminated to the community.",Distance-based ab initio protein structure prediction,10251061,R01GM093123,"['Amino Acid Sequence ', ' Primary Protein Structure ', ' protein sequence ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Attention ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Genome ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' Inborn Genetic Diseases ', ' Inherited disorder ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' heritable disorder ', ' inborn error ', ' inherited diseases ', ' inherited genetic disease ', ' inherited genetic disorder ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Structural Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Play ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Protein Engineering ', ' genetic protein engineering ', ' protein design ', ' Proteins ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Technology ', ' Weight ', ' Renaissance ', ' Sequence Alignment ', ' sequencing alignment ', ' Tertiary Protein Structure ', ' Peptide Domain ', ' Protein Domains ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' X-Ray Crystallography ', ' Single Crystal Diffraction ', ' X Ray Crystallographies ', ' X-Ray Diffraction Crystallography ', ' X-Ray/Neutron Crystallography ', ' Xray Crystallography ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' computer biology ', ' Computational Biology ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' empowered ', ' experience ', ' monomer ', ' Performance ', ' structural biology ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' drug development ', ' Homo ', ' protein structures ', ' proteins structure ', ' protein structure ', ' Mutate ', ' Protein Region ', ' protein function ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' self assembly ', ' cost ', ' reconstruction ', ' three-dimensional modeling ', ' 3-D modeling ', ' 3D modeling ', ' protein structure prediction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' 3-D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3D structure ', ' C-terminal ', ' comparative ', ' biophysical techniques ', ' biophysical approaches ', ' biophysical methodology ', ' biophysical methods ', ' learning network ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' Structural Protein ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' long short term memory ', ' protein data bank ', ' protein databank ', ' open source tool ', ' open source toolkit ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2021,342174,MO-04
"Deep learning for decoding genetic regulation and cellular maps in craniofacial development Project Summary A deep understanding of gene regulation and function during craniofacial development is not only important for our biological knowledge, but also critical to identify causal variants and genes underlying many dental, oral, and craniofacial (DOC) diseases. Numerous -omics datasets at the genomic, epigenomic, (single-cell) transcriptomic levels have been generated for craniofacial development and DOC diseases. These datasets are highly heterogeneous (e.g. platforms, species, tissues, developmental stages) and cross-species (e.g. human and mouse), requiring novel analytical approaches for decoding genetic regulation, molecular function, and cellular maps in craniofacial development. Critically, because of practical unavailability of human embryonic craniofacial tissue, there is a big gap between the abundant -omics and functional studies in murine craniofacial development and large-scale human genetic studies of DOC diseases. In this proposal, we combine machine learning, genomics, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), complex disease genetics, developmental biology to design novel methods aiming to decode complex genetic regulation and cellular maps during craniofacial development. We propose three specific aims. Aim 1. To develop a deep learning method, DeepFace, for characterizing and prioritizing genetic variants and regulation during craniofacial development. DeepFace is designed to decipher functional impact of noncoding variants and will be the first deep learning method to integrate cross-species functional features in craniofacial development. We will validate DeepFace by using data from genome-wide association studies (15 datasets) and case-parent trio-based whole genome sequencing (3 datasets) of orofacial clefts (OFCs). This validation will identify potential causal variants, both common and de novo mutations, in OFCs. Aim 2. To develop deep learning methods for time-series scRNA-seq data analysis in craniofacial development. We will develop novel algorithms including TTNNet for integrating time-series scRNA- seq data and DrivAER for tracing developmental trajectories and identifying driving transcription factors in craniofacial development. We will validate the methods using scRNA-seq datasets from the FaceBase consortium and to-be-generated data for mouse palate formation. Aim 3. To experimentally validate and characterize the top ranked novel mutations (Aim 1) and regulators (Aim 2). Building on our previous studies, strong preliminary data and highly experienced team, this proposal is timely to develop machine learning methods to effectively address the current gap between the genomics studies in murine craniofacial development and human genetic studies of orofacial clefts. The successful completion will provide 1) the NIDCR research community a suite of novel methods and analytical tools for genomic/epigenomic/scRNA-seq data, and 2) the mechanistic assessment on the mutations/genes and transcriptional regulators that are potentially involved in OFCs and related craniofacial diseases. Project Narrative Numerous -omics datasets at the genomic, epigenomic, (single-cell) transcriptomic levels have been generated for craniofacial development and dental, oral, and craniofacial (DOC) diseases; however, these data are highly heterogeneous, limiting the analysis for the understanding of DOC biology and discovery of causal mutations and regulators in DOC diseases.

"Nonlinear performance analysis and prediction for robust low dose lung CT 1 PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  2 Nonlinear algorithms such as model-based reconstruction (MBR) and deep learning (DL) reconstruction have  3 sparked tremendous research interest in recent years. Compared to traditional linear approaches, the nonline-  4 arity of these algorithm transcends traditional signal-to-noise requirement and offer flexibility to draw information  5 from a variety of sources (e.g., statistical model, prior image, dictionary, training data). MBR has enabled numer-  6 ous advancements including low-dose CT and advanced scanning protocols. Deep learning algorithms are rap-  7 idly emerging and have demonstrated superior dose vs. image quality tradeoffs in research settings. However,  8 widespread clinical adoption of nonlinear algorithms has been impeded by the lack of a lack of systematic, quan-  9 titative methods for performance analysis. Nonlinear methods come with numerous dependencies on the imag- 10 ing techniques, the imaging target, and the prior information, and the data itself. The relationship between these 11 dependencies and image quality is often opaque. Furthermore, improper selection of algorithmic parameters can 12 lead to erroneous features (e.g., smaller lesions, texture) in the reconstruction. Therefore, methods to quantify 13 and predict performance permit efficient and quantifiable performance evaluation to provide the robust control 14 and understanding of imaging output necessary for reliable clinical application and regulatory oversight. 15 We propose to establish a robust, predictive framework for performance assessment and optimization that can 16 be generalized to any reconstruction method. We quantify performance in turns of the perturbation response and 17 covariance as a function of imaging techniques, system configurations, patient anatomy, and, importantly, the 18 perturbation itself. The perturbation response quantifies the appearance (e.g., biases, blurs, distortions), and, 19 together with the covariance, allows the computation of more complex metrics such as task-based performance 20 and radiomic measures including size, shape, and texture information. We illustrate utility of the approach in lung 21 imaging with the following specific aims: Aim 1: Develop a lesion library and generate perturbations encom- 22 passing clinically relevant features. We will extract lesions from public databases and develop methods lesion 23 emulation in for realistic CT simulation and physical data via 3D printing technology. Aim 2: Develop a gener- 24 alized prediction framework for perturbation response and covariance. Using analytical and neural network 25 modeling, we will establish a framework that predicts perturbation response and covariance across imaging 26 scenarios for classes of algorithms with increasing data-dependence including MBR with a Huber penalty, MBR 27 with dictionary regularization, and a deep learning reconstructor. Aim 3: Develop assessment and optimiza- 28 tion strategies to drive robust, low dose lung screening CT methods. We will optimize and adapt nonlinear 29 algorithms and protocols for lung cancer screening to achieve faithful representations of clinical features. This 30 work has the potential to drive much-needed quantitative assessment standards that directly relate image quality 31 to diagnostic performance and optimal strategies for robust, reliable clinical deployment of nonlinear algorithms. 32 PROJECT NARRATIVE Major research efforts have been devoted to the development of nonlinear reconstruction algorithms – from model-based reconstruction to deep learning, these algorithms have demonstrated many advantages such as improved image quality, reduced radiation dose, and additional diagnostic information that are not achievable with traditional linear reconstructions. However, only a disproportionately small number has reach the clinic due to the lack of a predictive image quality analysis framework to quantify diagnostic performance, control algorithm behavior, and ensure consistent performance for robust clinical deployment. The propose effort use a combination of analytic and machine learning approaches to drive much-needed quantitative assessment standards that directly relate image quality to diagnostic performance and establish optimal strategies for robust, reliable clinical deployment of nonlinear algorithms.",Nonlinear performance analysis and prediction for robust low dose lung CT,10121056,R01CA249538,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Beauty ', ' Behavior ', ' Dictionary ', ' Genes ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Libraries ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Nodule ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Lung nodule ', ' pulmonary nodule ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Technology ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Clinical ', ' Non-linear Models ', ' Nonlinear Models ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' insight ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' lung cancer screening ', ' lung cancer early detection ', ' Shapes ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' exhaustion ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Scanning ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' Texture ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Transcend ', ' interest ', ' Radiation Dose ', ' Radiation Dose Unit ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Appearance ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Electronic library ', ' Digital Libraries ', ' Data ', ' Scheme ', ' Derivation procedure ', ' Derivation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' reconstruction ', ' shape analysis ', ' shape description ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' screening ', ' 3D Print ', ' 3-D print ', ' 3-D printer ', ' 3D printer ', ' 3D printing ', ' three dimensional printing ', ' Lung CAT Scan ', ' CT Lung Screening ', ' Lung CT ', ' Lung CT scan ', ' computerized tomography lung screening ', ' lung computerized axial tomography scan ', ' lung computerized tomography ', ' lung computerized tomography scan ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' imaging system ', ' targeted imaging ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' predicting response ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' radiomics ', ' clinical translation ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' low dose computed tomography ', ' low dose computerized tomography ', ' low-dose CT ', ' ']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,512567,MD-07
"Development of machine learning approaches to population pharmacokinetic model selection and evaluation of application to model-based bioequivalence analysis. PROJECT SUMMARY  The proposed project is for development an evaluation of a deep learning/reinforcement learning approach to population pharmacokinetic model selections. We proposed to develop a command line application using the Python programing language. Python is the current industry standard for development or artificial intelligence applications, and the required packages for deep learning/reinforcement learning are readily available (e.g., Pytorch and Tensorflow). The applicants have previously developed a related machine learning approach using Genetic Algorithm. For purposes of comparison and to make the resulting application generally available, the existing Genetic Algorithm solution will be ported to Python. Both applications (Deep learning/reinforcement learning and Genetic Algorithm) will use NONMEM ® for parameter estimation for the population pharmacokinetic models examined. A common solution linking the model selection algorithm (Deep Learning/Reinforcement Learning and Genetic Algorithm) to NONMEM will be used for both, and is currently under development, with an early version available on github.com. This common solution will facilitate future work using other algorithms for model selection, e.g. particle swarm optimization or simulated annealing. This work will be completed in the first year of the project. All final code will be place in the public domain in github.com.  The second year of the project will consist of evaluation of the solutions (Genetic algorithm and Deep Learning/Reinforcement Learning). This evaluation will include assessment of a range of measures of the “goodness” of the model (“fitness in Genetic Algorithm and “reward signal” in Deep Learning/Reinforcement Learning). These measure of model “goodness” may include objective function value, parsimony penalties, importance of successful covariance step. Within the scope of this project, these measures will be objective and numerical.

"Brain phantom generation by generative adversarial net (GAN) for AI-based emission tomography Project Summary  Positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) are useful functional medical imaging techniques that can be performed to evaluate brain functions such as regional cerebral perfusion and neurotransmission. The spatial resolution of reconstruction for PET is usually 3-6 mm, and for SPECT is only 1-2 cm. Motivated by the latest advances in artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) and its successful application to MRI and CT, it is highly desirable to develop an ML-based system for PET/SPECT cerebral image reconstruction (one of our specific interests is Parkinson disease) to achieve higher resolution and lower noise than using conventional approaches. However, to develop such a learning system, ground-truth data (accurate images, used as the labels) that guide the training are unavailable from the the real world. Published ML systems for PET imaging have used reconstructed images from conventional methods as the label to guide the training. As a result, the goal was only targeted to improve reconstruction speed, rather than improving the image quality. Since the quality of reconstructed image by ML system cannot exceed the guiding images, the performance of ML system cannot surpass conventional methods. Therefore, in this project, we propose a two-year project that will use conditional generative adversarial networks (GAN) to generate digital 2-D human brain phantoms, which will be highly similar to real human brains. The generated phantoms will serve as the (precise) ground-truth data to develop ML-based PET/SPECT reconstruction systems (our future research). The generated phantoms will contain an activity image and an attenuation map. Hence, results from this work can be used for simulating brain PET or SPECT examinations for various neurological disorders, and neural network can be trained with known ground truth. In addition, designing ML systems often relies on large amounts of data, but it is not easy to access data from a large number of patients in the US for specific medical research (mature ML systems developed for computer vision and image classification often involve images on the million level for training). Existing ML systems developed for MRI, CT, and PET imaging often merely uses a few tens of patient data for training and even less data to validate. Therefore, those systems are high-likely overfitted to the data used in training. With the generation system proposed from this project, we can produce a large phantom population to avoid the overfitting problem when design the AI image-reconstruction system. Once the GAN system is successfully developed, it can be easily transplanted to phantom generation for the AI-based CT and AI-based MRI. The method is also potentially extendable to generate phantom populations of torso, abdomen, and extremities for simulating cardiac imaging, tumor imaging, etc. Project Narrative  A two-year small project for generating 2-D digital brain phantoms by generative adversarial net (GAN). The generator can generate artificial digital phantoms very similar to realistic phantoms, so a large number of ground-truth images become available for developing machine-learning-based emission tomography.",Brain phantom generation by generative adversarial net (GAN) for AI-based emission tomography,10293006,R03EB030653,"['Abdomen ', ' Abdominal ', ' Affect ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' bone ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Educational Status ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' educational level ', ' training achievement ', ' training level ', ' training status ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Noise ', ' Discipline of Nuclear Medicine ', ' Atomic Medicine ', ' Nuclear Medicine ', ' Radiology / Radiation Biology / Nuclear Medicine ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Physics ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' PET ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET imaging ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PETT ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' Publishing ', ' putamen ', ' Research ', ' Time ', ' tomography ', ' single photon emission computed tomography ', ' SPECT ', ' SPECT imaging ', ' Single-Photon Emission-Computed Radionuclide Tomography ', ' Training Support ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' United States ', ' Vascular Diseases ', ' Vascular Disorder ', ' blood vessel disorder ', ' vascular dysfunction ', ' vasculopathy ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Medical Research ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Cerebrum ', ' cerebral ', ' uptake ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' System ', ' Collimation ', ' Collimator ', ' Width ', ' interest ', ' computer imaging ', ' digital imaging ', ' cardiac imaging ', ' cardiac scanning ', ' heart scanning ', ' heart imaging ', ' Performance ', ' radiolabel ', ' radiotracer ', ' attenuation ', ' Speed ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' axon signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neurotransmission ', ' simulation ', ' DA Neuron ', ' Dopamine neuron ', ' dopaminergic neuron ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Scheme ', ' Monitor ', ' Cardiac ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' reconstruction ', ' virtual ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' cancer imaging ', ' oncologic imaging ', ' oncology imaging ', ' tumor imaging ', ' Population ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' image guided ', ' image guidance ', ' data access ', ' reduce symptoms ', ' alleviate symptom ', ' ameliorating symptom ', ' decrease symptom ', ' fewer symptoms ', ' relieves symptoms ', ' symptom alleviation ', ' symptom reduction ', ' symptom relief ', ' neural network ', ' ']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R03,2021,81875,MD-07
"Learning an Optimized Variational Network for Medical Image Reconstruction Project Summary We propose a novel way of reconstructing medical images rooted in deep learning and computer vision that models the process how human radiologists are using years of experience from reading thousands of cases to recognize anatomical structures, pathologies and image artifacts. Our approach is based on the novel idea of a variational network, which embeds a generalized compressed sensing concept within a deep learning framework. We propose to learn a complete reconstruction procedure, including filter kernels and penalty functions to separate between true image content and artifacts, all parameters that normally have to be tuned manually as well as the associated numerical algorithm described by this variational network. The training step is decoupled from the time critical image reconstruction step, which can then be performed in near-real-time without interruption of clinical workflow. Our preliminary patient data from accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions suggest that our learning approach outperforms the state-of-the-art of currently existing image reconstruction methods and is robust with respect to the variations that arise in a daily clinical imaging situation. In our first aim, we will test the hypothesis that learning can be performed such that it is robust against changes in data acquisition. In the second aim, we will answer the question if it is possible to learn a single reconstruction procedure for multiple MR imaging applications. Finally, we will perform a clinical reader study for 300 patients undergoing imaging for internal derangement of the knee. We will compare our proposed approach to a clinical standard reconstruction. Our hypothesis is that our approach will lead to the same clinical diagnosis and patient management decisions when using a 5min exam. The immediate benefit of the project is to bring accelerated imaging to an application with wide public-health impact, thereby improving clinical outcomes and reducing health-care costs. Additionally, the insights gained from the developments in this project will answer the currently most important open questions in the emerging field of machine learning for medical image reconstruction. Finally, given the recent increase of activities in this field, there is a significant demand for a publicly available data repository for raw k-space data that can be used for training and validation. Since all data that will be acquired in this project will be made available to the research community, this project will be a first step to meet this demand. Project Narrative The overarching goal of the proposal is to develop a novel machine learning-based image reconstruction approach and validate it for accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The approach is able to learn the characteristic appearance of clinical imaging datasets, as well as suppression of artifacts that arise during data acquisition. We will test the hypotheses that learning can be performed such that it is robust against changes in data acquisition, answer the question if it is possible to learn a single reconstruction procedure for multiple MR imaging applications, and validate our approach in a clinical reader study for 300 patients undergoing imaging for internal derangement of the knee.",Learning an Optimized Variational Network for Medical Image Reconstruction,10231217,R01EB024532,"['Acceleration ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Clinical Protocols ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Evaluation Studies ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' indexing ', ' Joints ', ' Knee ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Motivation ', ' Noise ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Blinded ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' radiologist ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Musculoskeletal ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Appearance ', ' Touch ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch sensation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' performance tests ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Data ', ' Interruption ', ' Reader ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' reconstruction ', ' conditioning ', ' Outcome ', ' Step training ', ' Step retraining ', ' prospective ', ' Consumption ', ' data acquisition ', ' data space ', ' patient population ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' clinical imaging ', ' clinical translation ', ' pathology imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' data repository ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' ']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,436674,NY-12
"Predicting Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) Through Artificial Intelligence Analysis of Pre-Diagnostic CT Images The objective of the proposed project is to develop a Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) prediction model to identify individuals who have high risk for PDAC in the next 3 years through Artificial Intelligence (AI) analysis of pre-diagnostic CT images and non-imaging factors. PDAC is the fourth leading cause of cancer- related deaths in both men and women in the United States despite its low incidence rate. The 5-year survival rate for all stages of PDAC is 10% but can be as high as 50% with early-stage diagnosis. Therefore, identification of individuals at high risk for PDAC has high clinical significance as follow-up imaging examinations or biopsy may assist in early detection and allow surgical intervention while the tumors are still resectable. However, PDAC prediction is difficult due to the lack of reliable screening tools, the absence of sensitive and specific symptoms and biomarkers, and low prevalence.  Abdominal pain is the single most common reason that Americans visit the emergency room (ER), where an abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) scan is usually performed. Even though most scans don’t show any signs of cancer visible to the naked eyes of radiologists, some subjects eventually develop PDAC in the next few years. These pre-diagnostic CT images provide critical morphological information associated with biological changes at the pre-cancer or early cancer stage, which can be extracted using AI to predict PDAC risk. Therefore, the objective of the proposed project is to uncover unique features in pre-diagnostic images using AI and develop PDAC prediction model based on these features. Non-imaging factors such as demographic, epidemiologic, and anthropometric factors, clinical comorbidities, and laboratory tests will be included in the model to improve the prediction accuracy. The primary hypotheses are a) AI allows extraction of unique image features in pre-diagnostic CT images associated with pre-cancer or early cancer biological changes that are invisible to naked eyes and b) the combination of pre-diagnostic image features and non- imaging factors improves the accuracy of PDAC risk stratification and prediction over that using conventional non-imaging factors alone. To verify these hypotheses, we will retrospectively evaluate CT pancreatic images obtained up to 3 years prior to PDAC diagnosis that were deemed non-cancerous by radiologists. A group of subjects who underwent similar imaging studies for non-gastrointestinal disorders and were age/gender matched with pre-diagnostic imaging will serve as healthy controls. Accurately stratifying high risk individuals may allow for early detection of PDAC in the future. A major challenge of the project is the scarcity of the appropriate imaging data because of the low prevalence of PDAC and stringent enrollment criteria. Eight major medical centers will participate in collection of 1,064 cases. The end point of this project is the development, training, and validation of an AI-based PDAC prediction model, which will identify individuals who are at high risk for developing PDAC within the next 3 years. Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a common type of pancreatic cancer, is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in both men and women in the United States. The goal of the proposed project is to develop an artificial intelligence algorithm based on computed- tomography scans to identify individuals at high risk for PDAC, which may allow early detection and increase survival rate.",Predicting Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) Through Artificial Intelligence Analysis of Pre-Diagnostic CT Images,10236146,R01CA260955,"['Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' Malignant Pancreatic Neoplasm ', ' Pancreas Cancer ', ' Pancreatic Cancer ', ' pancreatic malignancy ', ' Malignant neoplasm of pancreas ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scanning ', ' Texture ', ' Techniques ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Visit ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Modeling ', ' pancreas imaging ', ' Pancreas Ductal Adenocarcinoma ', ' Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Reader ', ' Resectable ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Collection ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Low Prevalence ', ' Validation ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' tumor ', ' high risk ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' abdominal CT ', ' abdominal computed tomography ', ' radiomics ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' imaging study ', ' human error ', ' deep learning ', ' automated segmentation ', ' auto-segmentation ', ' automatic segmentation ', ' autosegmentation ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' Abdominal Pain ', ' Accounting ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biopsy ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic Imaging ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Incidence ', ' Laboratories ', ' Manuals ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' mortality ', ' Pancreas ', ' Pancreatic ', ' Pancreatic duct ', ' Wirsung canal ', ' Patients ', ' Risk ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' Training Technics ', ' Training Technique ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Training ', ' Tail of pancreas ', ' Individual ', ' radiologist ', ' ']",NCI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,1160586,CA-28
"Task-aware and Autonomous Robotic C-arm Servoing for Flouroscopy-guided Interventions Project Summary Fluoroscopy guidance using C-arm X-ray systems is used in more than 17 million procedures across the US and constitutes the state-of-care for various percutaneous procedures, including internal ﬁxation of pelvic ring injuries. To infer procedural progress from 2D radiographs, well-deﬁned views onto anatomy must be achieved and restored multiple times during surgery. This process, known as ”ﬂuoro hunting”, is associated with 4.7 s of excessive ﬂuoroscopy time per C-arm position (c. f. 120 s total per ﬁxation), yielding radiographs that are never interpreted clinically, but drastically increasing procedure time and radiation dose to patient and surgical staff.  Our long-term project goal is to use concepts from machine learning and active vision to develop task-aware algorithms for autonomous robotic C-arm servoing that interpret intra-operative radiographs and autonomously adjust the C-arm pose to acquire ﬂuoroscopic images that are optimal for inference. We have three speciﬁc aims: 1) Detecting unfavorable K-wire trajectories from monoplane ﬂuoroscopy images: We will extend a physics-based sim- ulation framework for ﬂuoroscopy from CT that enables fast generation of structured and realistic radiographs documenting procedural progress. Based on this data, we will train a state-of-the-art convolutional neural net- work that interprets ﬂuoroscopic images to infer procedural progress. 2) Developing and validating a task-aware imaging system in silico: Using the autonomous interpretation tools and simulation pipeline available through Aim 1, we will train an artiﬁcial agent based on reinforcement learning and active vision. This agent will be capable of analyzing intra-operative ﬂuoroscopic images to autonomously adjust the C-arm pose to yield task- optimal views onto anatomy. 3) Demonstrating feasibility of our task-aware imaging concept ex vivo: Our third aim will establish task-aware C-arm imaging in controlled clinical environments. We will attempt internal ﬁxation of anterior pelvic ring fractures and our task-aware artiﬁcial agent will interpret intra-operatively acquired ra- diographs to infer procedural progress and suggest optimal C-arm poses that will be realized manually with an optically-tracked mobile C-arm system.  This work combines the expertise of a computer scientist, a surgical robotics expert, and an orthopedic trauma surgeon to explore the untapped, understudied area of autonomous imaging enabled by advances in machine learning in ﬂuoroscopy-guided procedures. This development has only recently been made feasible by innovations in fast ﬂuoroscopy simulation from CT to provide structured data for training that is sufﬁciently realistic to warrant generalization to clinical data. With support from the NIH Trailblazer Award, our team will be the ﬁrst to investigate autonomous and task-aware C-arm imaging systems, paving the way for a new paradigm in medical image acquisition, which will directly beneﬁt millions of patients by task-oriented image acquisition on a patient-speciﬁc basis. Subsequent R01 funding will customize this concept to other high-volume procedures, such as vertebroplasty. Project Narrative Fluoroscopy guidance using C-arm X-ray systems is the state-of-care for percutaneous fracture ﬁxation, and requires surgeons to achieve and reproduce well deﬁned views onto anatomy to infer procedural progress. This requirement alone is estimated to contribute 4.7 s of ﬂuoroscopy time per C-arm repositioning (c. f. 120 s total per ﬁxation), drastically increasing procedure time and radiation dose to patient and surgical team.

"Quantitative, non-invasive characterization of urinary stone composition and fragility using multi-energy CT and machine learning techniques PROJECT SUMMARY Symptomatic urinary stone disease (USD) affects >8% of the United States population, resulting in an estimated annual medical cost exceeding $10 billion. Computed tomography (CT) is the established method for imaging urinary calculi and can provide accurate sub-millimeter details of the size and location of renal stones. However, in vivo characterization of more than just size and location is critical for quantifying stone characteristics important for optimal patient health management and essential for clinical research. A complete characterization of renal stones, including stone composition and fragility, is needed for safe and cost effective management of USD, as well as for phenotyping of research subjects. Our proposal meets these needs by developing methods to accurately and non-invasively characterize stones using low-dose, multi-energy CT. Our long-term goal is to use advanced CT methodologies to characterize urinary calculi for the purpose of directing clinical treatment and facilitating clinical investigation. Our objectives in this application are to develop and validate in vivo quantitative techniques for characterizing mixed and non-uric-acid stone types, as well as for predicting the likelihood of successful stone comminution, a novel concept we refer to as stone fragility. These image-based stone biometrics will enable evidence-based identification of treatment strategies that maximize effectiveness while minimizing risk, as well as accurate and non-invasive classification of research subjects to accelerate scientific advances in the understanding and treatment of USD. We will meet these objectives by accomplishing the following specific aims:  Specific Aim 1: Develop and validate CT techniques to characterize mixed and non-uric-acid  stone types.  Specific Aim 2: Develop and validate CT techniques to predict stone fragility. Current state-of-the-art stone imaging technology cannot accurately identify the composition of mixed and non- uric-acid stone types, nor can it provide quantitative indications of the likelihood of efficient comminution using the lowest risk technique. The innovation of this proposal lies in the use of newly developed statistical, deep learning and texture analysis techniques to quantitatively describe essential characteristics of urinary calculi, namely composition and fragility. The significance of this proposal is that the knowledge derived from using such techniques represents unique quantitative biomarkers that will allow physicians and researchers to more effectively manage and study USD. The developed methods respond to critical needs in the field of stone disease and will advance the ability of physicians to optimally direct patient therapy and scientists to phenotype research subjects. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will develop imaging techniques that can determine urinary stone composition and fragility in patients. The significance of this is that these advanced CT imaging techniques will allow physicians to more efficiently direct patient therapy and perform clinical research, potentially avoiding procedures associated with higher risk or cost.","Quantitative, non-invasive characterization of urinary stone composition and fragility using multi-energy CT and machine learning techniques",10129958,R01EB028591,"['Affect ', ' Alkalies ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Calcium Oxalate ', ' calcium salt Ethanedioic acid ', ' calcium phosphate ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Kidney Calculi ', ' Kidney Stones ', ' Renal Calculi ', ' Renal Stone ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Minerals ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' United States ', ' Uric Acid ', ' Trioxopurine ', ' Urinary Calculi ', ' Urinary Stones ', ' Urinary Tract Stones ', ' Urolith ', ' Generations ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' Research Subjects ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' medical costs ', ' Injury to Kidney ', ' kidney injury ', ' renal injury ', ' Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Ureteroscopy ', ' Surface ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Recovery ', ' Bilateral ', ' Measurement ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Source ', ' Texture ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' attenuation ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Dose ', ' Cost Efficient Management ', ' Cost Effective Management ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment strategy ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' risk minimization ', ' clinical investigation ', ' photon-counting detector ', ' photon detection ', ' single photon detector ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' health management ', ' health care management ', ' healthcare management ', ' deep learning ', ' statistical learning ', ' ']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2021,350335,MN-01
"OCT and OCTA image processing for retinal assessment of people with MS Project Summary/Abstract (Max 30 lines of text) Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is necessary for diagnosing multiple sclerosis (MS), it has been challenging to acquire consistent MRI measurements of MS disease burden. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the retina has emerged as a complementary source of imaging biomarkers, wherein retinal thickness measurements have been shown to correlate well with MS disease burden. As well, OCT angiography (OCTA)—a new imaging modality acquired with the same OCT scanner—yields multiple new biomarkers among which macular vessel density has been shown to correlate with MS disability. There is strong evidence that OCT and OCTA may provide much needed imaging biomarkers for MS, but there are remaining technical challenges to overcome. Many algorithms for computation of retinal layer thicknesses from OCT images have been developed, but measurement of longitudinal changes in individual MS subjects remains highly challenging, especially in MS where yearly changes are small relative to intrinsic measurement variations. We propose a novel iterative registration and deep learning segmentation algorithm for longitudinal OCT retinal image segmentation. Development of automatic algorithms for analysis of OCTA images is in an early stage and there are opportunities for significant improvements. We will develop a deep network for OCTA vessel segmentation and biomarker computation that both suppresses artifacts that are common in OCTA and provides consistent results across different scanners. As both OCT and OCTA become more widely used in the characterization and management of MS, it is becoming increasingly important to jointly characterize these biomarkers and relate them to disease status, which is currently characterized largely by clinical evaluations. We will address the central question of whether OCT and OCTA can be used to predict disease progression by developing a new disease progression score for MS based on multiple OCT and OCTA measurements as well as clinical and MRI biomarkers, acquired in both single and multiple imaging visits. The proposed research will: 1) Develop a fast, topologically-correct longitudinal segmentation method for the macula; 2) Develop a method for artifact-suppressed and consistent computation of OCTA features in the macula; 3) Develop a disease progression score to jointly characterize longitudinal retinal OCT and OCTA measurements in MS; and 4) Carry out longitudinal studies of healthy controls and people with MS using OCT and OCTA measurements. We will assess whether average features within the macula or features averaged over smaller segments yield better estimates of progression. We will also assess whether OCT alone or OCT together with OCTA provide better estimates of progression. Image processing and disease progression algorithms will be made freely available to the research community. The proposed research will greatly advance the use of OCT and OCTA in characterizing longitudinal changes in the retina, potentially leading to standard eye measurements for monitoring and managing MS and other neurological and eye diseases. Project Narrative Monitoring the progression of multiple sclerosis (MS) has been challenging due to the inconsistency and variability of both clinical and magnetic resonance imaging assessments. This project will develop methods and software for analysis of both optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) scans of the retina, both of which show correlation to disability in MS. At the conclusion of the grant, software implementing the methods will be made available to the research community in a highly portable computer language.",OCT and OCTA image processing for retinal

"Deep learning for population genetics Project Summary The revolution in genome sequencing technologies over the past 15 years has created an explosion of population genomic data but has left in its wake a gap in our ability to make sense of data at this scale. In particular, whereas population genetics as a field has been traditionally data-limited, the massive volume of current sequencing means that previously unanswerable questions may now be within reach. To capitalize on this flood of information we need new methods and modes of analysis.  In the past 5 years the world of machine learning has been revolutionized by the rise of deep neural networks. These so-called deep learning methods offer incredible flexibility as well as astounding improvements in performance for a wide array of machine learning tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. This proposal aims to harness the great potential of deep learning for population genetic inference.  In recent years our group has made great strides in using supervised machine learning for population genomic analysis (reviewed in Schrider and Kern 2018). However, this work has focused primarily on using more traditional machine learning methods such as random forests. As we argue in this proposal, DNA sequence data are particularly well suited for modern deep learning techniques, and we demonstrate that the application of these methods can rapidly lead to state-of-the-art performance in very difficult population genetic tasks such as estimating rates of recombination. The power of these methods for handling genetic data stems in part from their ability to automatically learn to extract as much useful information as possible from an alignment of DNA sequences in order to solve the task at hand, rather than relying on one or more predefined summary statistics which are generally problem-specific and may omit information present in the raw data.  In this proposal we lay out a systematic approach for both empowering the field with these tools and understanding their shortcomings. In particular, we propose to design deep neural networks for solving population genetic problems, and incorporate successful networks into user-friendly software tools that will be shared with the community. We will also investigate a variety of methods for estimating the uncertainty of predictions produced by deep learning methods; this area is understudied in machine learning but of great importance to biological researchers who require an accurate measure of the degree of uncertainty surrounding an estimate. Finally, we will explore the impact of training data misspecification—wherein the data used to train a machine learning method differ systematically from the data to which it will be applied in practice. We will devise techniques to mitigate the impact of such misspecification in order to ensure that our tools will be robust to the complications inherent in analyzing real genomic data sets. Together, these advances have the potential to transform the methodological landscape of population genetic inference. Project Narrative Deep learning has revolutionized such disparate fields as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. In this proposal we aim to harness the great potential of deep learning for population genetic inference. We will design, implement, and apply novel deep learning methods and provide open source software for others to both use and build upon, thereby producing valuable tools for the genetics researchers at large.",Deep learning for population genetics,10147906,R01HG010774,"['Algorithms ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Biology ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Floods ', ' Flooding ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Population Explosions ', ' Program Development ', ' Publishing ', ' Genetic Recombination ', ' DNA Recombination ', ' Recombination ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Trees ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Sequence Alignment ', ' sequencing alignment ', ' Natural Selections ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' infancy ', ' infantile ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Techniques ', ' empowered ', ' Performance ', ' speech recognition ', ' success ', ' user friendly computer software ', ' user friendly software ', ' novel ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' computational chemistry ', ' Genomics ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' open source ', ' stem ', ' tool development ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' network architecture ', ' genetic information ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' random forest ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' neural network architecture ', ' neural net architecture ', ' learning classifier ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' open source tool ', ' open source toolkit ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2021,417279,OR-04
"Advanced Technologies - National Center for Image Guided Therapy (AT-NCIGT) ABSTRACT: The intersection of healthcare and biomedical research is at an inflection point with the convergence of the digital revolution, advances in imaging, nanotechnology, big data science, and precision or personalized medicine. There is a wealth of meaningful, but complex information that could be extracted from imaging data but is not optimally utilized for patient care. Cancer care exemplifies the current challenges which include early detection, accurate distinction of pre- neoplastic and neoplastic lesions, prediction of tumor aggressiveness, determining infiltrative tumor margins during surgical treatment, tracking tumor evolution/ metastasis pattern, recurrence, and potential acquired resistance to treatments over time. Major strides have been made in the personalization of cancer therapies such as immunotherapy, but the availability of specific, relevant, and timely medical data and information is of critical importance to realizing the full potential of precision medicine. Nowhere is this more acutely evident than during interventions in the operating and procedure rooms. Novel methods of image guidance, data integration, information extraction, and knowledge transfer are needed to enable clinicians to fully leverage the information available, especially before, during and after invasive procedures. We are excited to re-submit a proposal for a new P41 biomedical resource center (BTRC) called Advanced Technologies for NCIGT(AT-NCIGT) with 3 TRDs, 10 new collaborative and 10 new service projects, all of which aim to investigate develop and disseminate new technologies for image guided therapy (IGT). The 3 components are Imaging Cancer Heterogeneity for IGT, Deep Learning for IGT and Intraoperative devices for IGT. These new technologies alone and in combinations will allow for greater understanding of disease state, treatment guidance, integration/navigation and in-vivo monitoring of tissue responses and improve the precision of invasive procedures. Thus the overall goal of this proposal is to investigate, develop and disseminate novel technologies for extracting new tissue characteristics (technology research and development core TRD 1: Imaging cancer heterogeneity; analyze them and make them available through state-of-the-art algorithmic and data curation approaches (Deep Learning TRD 2); and enable precise tissue sampling surgical navigation and in-vivo tissue response through the results of novel Intraoperative devices (Intraoperative devices for IGT: TRD 3). In order to effectively disseminate all this new knowledge we have 10 new collaborative and 10 new service projects and will share these novel tools through our established mechanisms, from current BTRC- National Center for Image Guided Therapy (NCIGT), which continues to be dedicated to the innovating for IGT into interventional radiology, surgery, radiation oncology, and procedure-based medicine. Project Narrative The Advanced Technologies-National Center for Image guided Therapy (AT-NCIGT) is a research and technology center with the mission of advancing patient care, by developing novel innovative tools for image guided Therapy (IGT). The three technologies encompass Imaging Cancer Heterogeneity, Deep learning and Intraoperative devices for image guided therapy which will be investigated both individually and in cross TR &D combinations.

"Deep Learning Approaches for Personalized Modeling and Forecasting of Glaucomatous Changes Project Summary Glaucoma is a leading cause of vision morbidity and blindness worldwide. Early disease detection and sensitive monitoring of progression are crucial to allow timely treatment for preservation of vision. The introduction of ocular imaging technologies significantly improves these capabilities, but in clinical practice there are still substantial challenges at managing the optimal care for individual cases due to difficulties of accurately assessing the potential progression and its speed and magnitude. These difficulties are due to a variety of causes that change over the course of the disease, including large inter-subject variability, inherent measurement variability, image quality, varying dynamic ranges of measurements, minimal measurable level of tissues, etc. In this proposal, we propose novel agnostic data-driven deep learning approaches to detect glaucoma and accurately forecast its progression that are optimized to each individual case. We will use state- of-the-art automated computerized machine learning methods, namely the deep learning approach, to identify structural features embedded within OCT images that are associated with glaucoma and its progression without any a priori assumptions. This will provide novel insight into structural information, and has shown very encouraging preliminary results. Instead of relying on the conventional knowledge-based approaches (e.g. quantifying tissues known to be significantly associated with glaucoma such as retinal nerve fiber layer), the proposed cutting-edge agnostic deep learning approaches determine the features responsible for future structural and functional changes out of thousands of features autonomously by learning from the provided large longitudinal dataset. This program will advance the use of structural and functional information obtained in the clinics with a substantial impact on the clinical management of subjects with glaucoma. Furthermore, the developed methods have potentials to be applied to various clinical applications beyond glaucoma and ophthalmology.

"Improved Techniques for Substitute CT Generation from MRI datasets This proposal will enable improved substitute CT images for use in PET/MR and MR-only radiation treatment planning. Given the greatly improved soft-tissue contrast of MR relative to CT, which aids interpretation of PET for PET/MR and target delineation for radiation treatment planning, a remaining limitation is the current capability to obtain sufficiently accurate substitute CT images from only MR-data. Unfortunately, MRI has limited capability to resolve bone and the inability of most MR acquisitions to distinguish between air and bone makes segmentation of these tissues types challenging. This project will utilize deep learning, a new and growing area of machine learning, to develop new methodology to create substitute CT images from rapid MR acquisitions that can be utilized in PET/MR and radiation treatment planning workflows. In Aim 1 we will study rapid MR acquisitions to be used with deep learning approaches for sCT generation in the head and pelvis using 3T PET/MR images matched with PET/CT imaging to create deep learning training and evaluation datasets. Different deep learning networks and MR inputs will be studied and adapted to determine the best PET reconstruction performance. In Aim 2 we will investigate rapid but motion-resilient approaches to whole- body MR imaging for subsequent deep learning-based substitute CT generation. In an exploratory subaim, we also propose to study methods of sCT generation that only utilize PET-only data. The data acquired in Aim 2 will be used to create comprehensive whole-body, motion-resilient datasets for training and evaluation of deep learning networks. In Aim 3 we will evaluate substitute CT approaches for MR-only radiation treatment planning. MR-only approaches will be compared to standard CT-based treatment simulation in the brain, head & neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis and deep learning networks will be optimized and evaluated for region- specific RT planning and simulation. Additionally, transfer learning approaches will be studied to extend sCT to a 0.35T MR-Linac to demonstrate respiratory motion resolved substitute CT generation. This proposal will enable improved substitute CT images for use in PET/MR and MR-only radiation treatment planning.

"A Novel Informatics System for Craniosynostosis Surgery Project Summary CranioSynOstosis (CSO) is the premature fusion of one or more of cranial sutures that connect individual skull bones for kids. The estimated prevalence of CSO is one in 2500 live births and even higher. Our ultimate goal is to develop an open-source imaging-informatics-platform, eSuture, for clinicians to objectively classify the craniosynostosis using computed tomography (CT) data, and accurately estimate patient-specific spring force for spring-assisted surgery (SAS). CSO is an extremely serious birth defect that involves the premature fusion, of one or more sutures on a baby's skull. CSO, in terms of the fused suture, could be classified mainly into several types of synostosis, such as sagittal, coronal, metopic, and lambdoid. Infants with CSO may have problems with brain and skull growth, resulting in cognitive impairment. This defect may not only ruin the infant's life, but also deeply affect the infant's family. SAS, recognized as a safe, effective, and less invasive treatment method, introduced to treat the CSO. This treatment uses the force of a spring to reshape the skull in a slower manner that harnesses the growth of the skull to assist with shape change. Patient-specific spring selection is the principal barrier to the advancement of SAS for CSO because few surgeons have the experience to select personalized springs for each patient. The selection of the spring force is a crucial step in this surgical treatment, and it is dependent on the experience of the surgeon. Important factors essential in the selection of the spring force include the ages, bone thickness and the subtypes of CSO. One example is that sagittal CSO with an elongated occiput needs a stronger posterior spring, while one with no predominant characteristics typically needs a mid-range anterior and posterior spring. The current problem is that we do not have a complete objective way of classification of CSO and sagittal CSO and estimation of the spring force for the individual. Our hypothesis is that CSO and sagittal CSO can be accurately classified based on the features from sutures and head shape, and behaviors of calvarial bone tissue following virtual optimal spring force can be accurately simulated by integrating a finite element method (FEM) with statistical learning model. To test our hypothesis, we are proposing the following Specific Aim: (1) To define the eSuture Informatic system and build the database, with CT and DTI data; (2) To develop tools for image processing, segmentation, registration, quantification of sutures, and automatically categorize each patient to one catalogue of the CSO types or sagittal CSO subtype; (3) To model and estimate the optimal spring force for SAS; and (4) To validate and evaluate the eSuture system.

"Can machines be trusted? Robustification of deep learning for medical imaging Machine learning algorithms have become increasing popular in medical imaging, where highly functional algorithms have been trained to recognize patterns or features within image data sets and perform clinically relevant tasks such as tumor segmentation and disease diagnosis. In recent years, an approach known as deep learning has revolutionized the field of machine learning, by leveraging massive datasets and immense computing power to extract features from data. Deep learning is ideally suited for problems in medical imaging, and has enjoyed success in diverse tasks such as segmenting cardiac structures, tumors, and tissues. However, research in machine learning has also shown that deep learning is fragile in the sense that carefully designed perturbations to an image can cause the algorithm to fail. These perturbations can be designed to be imperceptible by humans, so that a trained radiologist would not make the same mistakes. As deep learning approaches gain acceptance and move toward clinical implementation, it is therefore crucial to develop a better understanding of the performance of neural networks. Specifically, it is critical to understand the limits of deep learning when presented with noisy or imperfect data. The goal of this project is to explore these questions in the context of medical imaging—to better identify strengths, weaknesses, and failure points of deep learning algorithms. We posit that malicious perturbations, of the type studied in theoretical machine learning, may not be representative of the sort of noise encountered in medical images. Although noise is inevitable in a physical system, the noise arising from sources such as subject motion, operator error, or instrument malfunction may have less deleterious effects on a deep learning algorithm. We propose to characterize the effect of these perturbations on the performance of deep learning algorithms. Furthermore, we will study the effect of random labeling error introduced into the data set, as might arise due to honest human error. We will also develop new methods for making deep learning algorithms more robust to the types of clinically relevant perturbations described above. In summary, although the susceptibility of neural networks to small errors in the inputs is widely recognized in the deep learning community, our work will investigate these general phenomena in the specific case of medical imaging tasks, and also conduct the first study of average-case errors that could realistically arise in clinical studies. Furthermore, we will produce novel recommendations for how to quantify and improve the resiliency of deep learning approaches in medical imaging. In recent years, an approach known as deep learning has revolutionized the field of machine learning by achieving superhuman performance on many tasks. As deep learning approaches gain acceptance and move toward clinical implementation in assisting radiologists for tasks such as segmentation of cardiac structures, tumors, and tissues, it is critical to understand the limits of deep learning when presented with noisy or imperfect data.

"Radiation-specific Automated Dental Dose Distributions via Machine-learning based Mapping for Accurate Predictions of (Peri)odontal Problems (RADMAP) PROJECT SUMMARY Oral cavity and oropharyngeal (OC/OPC) cancers afflict more than 53,000 individuals in the United States annually. Despite advancements in oncologic therapies, the majority of patients will experience significant toxicity burden during and after therapy, including moderate-severe xerostomia, reduced mouth opening (i.e. trismus), periodontal disease, and osteoradionecrosis. To date, acute and chronic orodental complications are largely managed by clinicians and dentists based on empirical knowledge, with wide inter-provider management variability influenced by provider experience and available clinical information which is often incomplete, incorrect, or nonexistent. To further complicate long-term care of OC/OPC survivors, there is no standardized method for communicating with dentists the extent and intensity of radiation doses delivered to tooth bearing areas which is vital information for accurate assessment of risks related to dental procedures. Therefore, development of a standardized radiotherapy dental information tool and data-driven, algorithmic toxicity risk prediction models for enhanced communication and personalized medicine for OC/OPC survivors remains an unmet public health need. In response to NIDCR’s NOT-DE-20-006, we herein propose a rigorous and reproducible application of informatics and computational methods and approaches for the development of machine learning “ML/AI based optimization of clinical procedures for precision dental care”, “novel and robust data analysis algorithms to tackle causal mechanisms of action for onset and progression of disease” related to posttherapy orodental complications, and “computational modeling for treatment planning and assessment of treatment outcomes.” In Specific Aim 1, we will train and validate a deep learning contouring (DLC) neural network for automatic delineation of tooth-bearing regions. Our collaborator, Dr. van Dijk, has previous experience with DLC design and application for auto-delineation of non-dental head and neck organs at risk (OAR). Her research, published in a peer-reviewed journal showing an equal or significantly improved OAR automatic delineation using DLC over atlas-based contouring, will serve as a reproducible model for our proposed project. Using DLC-based mandibular and dental OAR delineation (SA 1), we will develop a novel “radiation odontogram” which will generate automated and accurate summative radiotherapy dose distribution mapping reports for effective datatransmission and communication among providers (SA 2). Accurate prognosis and management of high-morbidity high-prevalence post-therapy orodental sequelae will be enabled through the development of a statistically robust machine-learning based model of toxicity risk predictions that incorporates patient- and provide-generated data(Aim 3). In summary, the RADMAP proposal fosters innovative informatics and computational modeling approaches to address existing challenges in multidisciplinary communication and precision dental care for OC/OPC survivors, with practice-changing implications in the clinical setting and for oral, dental, and craniofacial research. PROJECT NARRATIVE Advancements in multimodal therapy for oral cavity and oropharyngeal (OC/OPC) cancer s have improved survival outcomes beyond 5 years. However, most survivors will experience moderate-severe orodental sequelae that are inadequately monitored or managed given the absence of structured communication of delivered therapies or robust toxicity risk prediction models to aid in decision -making. The proposed research aims to address these unmet public health needs by using core informatics and computational learning methods to develop a novel radiation odontogram and an automated, machine-learning based algorithm for accurate therapy-related orodental toxicity risk predictions.",Radiation-specific Automated Dental Dose Distributions via Machine-learning based Mapping for Accurate Predictions of (Peri)odontal Problems (RADMAP),10285226,R21DE031082,"['Adoption ', ' Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Atlases ', ' Award ', ' Combined Modality Therapy ', ' Multimodal Therapy ', ' Multimodal Treatment ', ' combination therapy ', ' combined modality treatment ', ' combined treatment ', ' multi-modal therapy ', ' multi-modal treatment ', ' Communication ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Aggregation ', ' Aggregated Data ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Decision Making ', ' Delphi Technique ', ' Delphi Technic ', ' Dental Care ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' dental service ', ' Dentistry ', ' Dentists ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' longterm care ', ' Mandible ', ' Inferior Maxillary Bone ', ' mandibular ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity -

"Radiomics signatures and patient outcomes in intracerebral hemorrhage PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The following K23 proposal is for Dr. Sam Payabvash, a Neuroradiologist and Assistant Professor of Radiology at Yale University. Dr. Payabvash is a physician-scientist with specialized expertise at the intersection of neuroscience, neuroimaging, and computer vision. His career goal is to find new treatment targets and to provide personalized care for patients with cerebrovascular disease. Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is one of the most devastating cerebrovascular diseases with no effective treatment. To date, imaging markers of ICH risk- stratification and outcome prediction have been subjective and descriptive in nature, leaving a large gap for automated assessment of imaging feautres embedded in medical images. Preliminary results by Dr. Payabvash have demonstrated the feasibility of a research plan to apply automated feature extraction pipelines and machine learning algorithms to harness the information in medical images for early risk-stratification and identification of potential treatment targets in ICH. In this proposal, Dr. Payabvash will use detailed clinical and imaging data of 3,991 patients from NIH-funded clinical trials, online archives, and institutional registries at Yale, Tufts, and University College of London. He will apply machine-learning algorithms to identify those imaging features of brain hemorrhage on baseline head CT scan that are related to symptom severity at presentation (aim 1). Then, he will use imaging features of hemorrhage to identify those patients who are at risk for early expansion of hematoma (aim 2a), or surrounding edema (aim 2b). These two “modifiable” indicators of poor outcome are considered potential treatment targets in ICH patients. Finally, he will combine admission clinical information and imaging features to build a risk-stratification tool for long-term outcome prediction (aim 3). Under the expert mentorship of Dr. Kevin Sheth (Chief of Neurocritical Care), Dr. Todd Constable (Director of MRI Research), and Dr. Ronald Coifman (Professor of Mathematics), this K23 award will allow Dr. Payabvash to (1) identify and address the most pressing issues in cerebrovascular disease with innovative neurogaming tools; (2) gain expertise in advanced statistical analysis of brain scans; and (3) expand his knowledge in machine learning and computer vision for assessment of medical images. Dr. Payabvash will receive didactic training in neuroimaging statistical analysis, machine learning, deep neural networks, and computer vision. The proposed research and career development plans draw on the wealth of resources available at Yale, including a Regional Coordinating Center for the NIH StrokeNet, the Center for Research Computing; High Performance Computing services, and cutting-edge image processing and analysis infrastructure. At the conclusion of this award period, Dr. Payabvash will be well-positioned to become an independently-funded investigator conducting high-quality research in advanced neuroimaging techniques and analysis aimed at improving the care of patients with cerebrovascular disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a severely debilitating cerebrovascular disease, which affects over 70,000 patients per year in the U.S., and is responsible for over half of stroke-related disability worldwide. So far, the diagnosis, surveillance, and prediction of outcome in intracerebral hemorrhage have mainly relied on visual and subjective assessment of head CT scans. Computerized assessment of medical images and machine learning algorithms can extract hidden features from CT scans and provide innovative tools for accurate outcome prediction and personalized

"Enabling Next Generation Machine Learning for Large Scale Image Analysis Project Summary/Abstract Deep learning has transformed medical image analysis by delivering clinically meaningful results on challenging problems like prostate cancer detection and lung screening. In pathology, industry is making signiﬁcant invest- ments to develop deep learning tools for diagnostic use in clinical labs. FDA approval of whole-slide digital pathology images (WSIs) for use in primary diagnosis is further increasing interest, adoption, and investment in this technology. Judgments made by pathologists are the basis for the treatment of many diseases, yet in- terobserver variability among pathologists is signiﬁcant, and errors can lead to overtreatment or even treatment of healthy patients. Pathology is also facing workforce issues as demand for pathologist services is outpacing growth of trained pathologists. Computational pathology tools based on deep learning can help address these problems by providing reproducible diagnoses, performing ”second reads” for human pathologists, automating tasks to improve pathologist efﬁciency, and helping general pathologists evaluate challenging cases. GPU accel- erators have played a signiﬁcant role in advancing deep learning methods to build computational pathology tools, with machine learning frameworks (MLFs) like Pytorch and Tensorﬂow providing researchers with abstractions to quickly develop models that utilize GPUs. Evolution of GPUs and MLFs has been driven by analysis of small images, and so these tools cannot be easily applied directly WSIs or other large medical images like three dimen- sional MRI or CT. Adapting medical imaging problems to small image paradigms supported by GPUs and MLFs leads to suboptimal performance and increased implementation effort and complexity. More recent approaches that use streaming or ”uniﬁed memory” allow direct analysis of entire WSIs and have demonstrated performance advantages. These approaches can be slow, complex to implement, and are highly speciﬁc to a choice of network architecture which limits exploration and development of new architectures. More general-purpose, efﬁcient, and user-friendly frameworks are required to allow the development of WSI scale deep learning.  This project will develop techniques to automatically map deep learning networks implemented in common MLF architectures to one or more GPUs for arbitrarily large input images and activation layers. The proposed software will include a performance modeler to estimate the runtime of a given network on available GPU acceler- ators. These strategies will enable a new paradigm in deep learning for medical images, allowing the development of novel networks that are purpose-built for medical applications. Developers will be able to rapidly create and evaluate these networks using familiar MLF packages. This project will provide approaches to overcome GPU memory bottlenecks, a scheduler to map the network to available GPUs, integration with common MLFs, and demonstration using computational pathology use cases. Narrative The proposed tools will help software developers overcome the limitations of current computing hardware to design more accurate deep learning models for use in clinical diagnostics. These models will be able to analyze very large digitized images of glass slides to aid pathologists in tasks like cancer detection. The ability to analyze these images in their entirety instead of in small parts will improve the diagnostic accuracy of models and will accelerate algorithm development efforts.",Enabling Next Generation Machine Learning for Large Scale Image Analysis,10384903,R41EB032722,"['Adoption ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Evolution ', ' Glass ', ' Goals ', ' Government Agencies ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Rural Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Industry ', ' Interobserver Variability ', ' Inter-Observer Variability ', ' Inter-Observer Variation ', ' Interobserver Variations ', ' Investments ', ' Judgment ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Medical Students ', ' medical school students ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Schedule ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Screening for Prostate Cancer ', ' detect prostate cancer ', ' prostate cancer detection ', ' prostate cancer early detection ', ' Pathologist ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Slide ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' computer imaging ', ' digital imaging ', ' Performance ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' high-end computing ', ' High Performance Computing ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' Imaging problem ', ' Modeling ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' user-friendly ', ' prototype ', ' tumor ', ' aging population ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' screening ', ' network architecture ', ' learning network ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' clinical diagnostics ', ' overtreatment ', ' over-treatment ', ' digital pathology ', ' pathology imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' TensorFlow ', ' neural network ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' algorithm development ', ' implementation efforts ', ' ']",NIBIB,"RNET TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R41,2021,256581,OH-10
"Real-time AI-enhanced Low Dose Fluoroscopy Project Summary Motivation: Fluoroscopy is an indispensable tool for image-guided interventions in 50 million surgeries performed annually in the US. It leverages ionizing radiation from x-rays to provide surgeons with real-time, high-quality imaging feedback. Radiation exposure is harmful for both the patients and surgeons. Repetitive patient exposure has been shown to double the risk of breast cancer in women; meanwhile, surgeon exposure is also concerning. Orthopedic surgeons are 5x more likely to develop cancer in their lifetime; spine surgeons receive up to 12x more radiation exposure compared to other orthopedic surgeons. With minimally invasive surgery becoming widely adopted in recent years, the use of fluoroscopy has greatly increased. Surgeons rely on the navigation provided by fluoroscopy during these procedures, as they do not have direct visualization of the anatomy. Therefore, reducing the radiation exposure from fluoroscopy while maintaining high imaging quality is a high priority. In the past few years, artificial intelligence (AI) methods have shown promising advances to improve the quality of medical imaging. Subtle Medical Inc. has already received FDA clearance for its AI-based software products to reduce the dose for PET by four times and improve image quality for MRI. The motivation of this proposal is to translate our initial success to another imaging modality and achieve low dose fluoroscopy. Approach: This phase I SBIR project has three aims. Aim 1 is to develop AI software using recurrent deep learning architecture to achieve 6x dose reduction for fluoroscopy. Aim 2 is to design model pruning, kernel optimization, and high-performance inference frameworks to achieve real-time processing. Finally, in Aim 3, we will evaluate both qualitatively and quantitatively the developed software on phantoms and cadavers. Significance: This work will enable six times lower dose fluoroscopy. The completion of the project will have wide impact to greatly reduce radiation exposure in the operating room, hence reducing the risk of cancer development for both patients and clinicians. Project Narrative Fluoroscopy leverages ionizing radiation to provide surgeons with real-time, high-quality imaging feedback, indispensable for image-guided interventions in clinics. However, the radiation exposure introduces imaging risks, not only to the patients, but also to clinicians, who perform surgeries routinely. This project aims to develop and validate a fluoroscopy image enhancement software using artificial intelligence that can reduce the radiation dose by six folds.",Real-time AI-enhanced Low Dose Fluoroscopy,10385142,R43EB031655,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Cadaver ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Feedback ', ' Fluoroscopy ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Image Enhancement ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' Industrialization ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' Operating Rooms ', ' Orthopedics ', ' Orthopedic ', ' Orthopedic Surgical Profession ', ' Patients ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' PET ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET imaging ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PETT ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' Ionizing radiation ', ' Ionizing Electromagnetic Radiation ', ' Radiation-Ionizing Total ', ' ionizing output ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Vertebral column ', ' Spinal Column ', ' Spine ', ' backbone ', ' Thyroid Gland ', ' Thyroid ', ' Thyroid Head and Neck ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' X-Ray Radiation ', ' X-ray ', ' Xray ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Malignant Childhood Neoplasm ', ' Childhood Cancers ', ' Malignant Childhood Tumor ', ' Malignant Pediatric Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Pediatric Tumor ', ' Malignant childhood cancer ', ' cancer in a child ', ' cancer in children ', ' child with cancer ', ' childhood malignancy ', ' children with cancer ', ' pediatric cancer ', ' pediatric malignancy ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Adopted ', ' Msec ', ' millisecond ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Spinal ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Radiation Dose ', ' Radiation Dose Unit ', ' Surgeon ', ' processing speed ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' realtime model ', ' real time model ', ' model design ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Dose ', ' breast cancer risk ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Device ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' image guided intervention ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' minimally invasive ', ' operation ', ' Spine surgery ', ' Spinal surgery ', ' Radiation exposure ', ' preservation ', ' deep learning ', ' denoising ', ' de-noising ', ' Visualization ', ' ']",NIBIB,"SUBTLE MEDICAL, INC.",R43,2021,132173,CA-18
"Deep learning for oral premalignancy evaluation PROJECT ABSTRACT: The overall objective of this proposal is the development and validation of rapid, deep learning-based digital pathology biomarkers for predicting risk and biological evolution of premalignant lesions progression to invasive oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC). To accomplish this task, we have assembled a team of clinical experts in oral premalignancy biology and patient care, and will deploy a cutting-edge computational pipeline to create computational models using a massive data set of more than 4000 samples. This project seeks to meet a critical unmet need in characterizing and risk stratifying the precursor lesions for OCSCC. Premalignant oral dysplasias transform to OCSCC at an overall 15% rate. Unfortunately, no unified grading schema exists to reflect the risk of progression from premalignancy to OCSCC, and interrater agreement between pathologists is low. The ability to prioritize the aggressiveness of dysplasias would be of significant benefit for guiding oral premalignancy management, as patients with OCSCC suffer from 55% five-year survival, high post-treatment relapse rate, and morbid diagnostic and treatment options. The current histopathology standard for premalignancy risk is hematoxylin and eosin (HE) slide evaluation by an expert pathologist. With a prevalence approaching 10%, the high frequency of oral premalignant lesions makes HE data abundant, and this large amount of data is an ideal use application for artificial intelligence methods. Deep Learning is an emerging discipline within artificial intelligence where digital image information can be automatically processed in order to recognize patterns in digital histology images and accomplish classification tasks. Deep learning is the focus of our lab, and we have both published and preliminary data relevant to premalignancy progression prediction. The central hypotheses of this proposal is that tissue patterns within oral premalignancy digital pathology samples can be automatically risk-stratified using deep learning, and contain important hidden information, and contain important hidden information about individual prognosis. In order to evaluate this hypothesis, this proposal seeks to train, validate, and interrogate a series of deep learning-based predictors to automatically assess progression risk in oral premalignancy digital pathology images. Each deep learning classifier will be built from patient histology samples and directly observed clinical outcomes. To accomplish the proposal tasks, we will build a global, multi-institution repository of more than 4000 patient samples: the Oral Premalignancy Repository for Deep Learning (OPR-DL), designed for deep learning research. This application responds to Notice of Special Interest NOT-CA-20-031, which seeks to “advance early detection of head and neck cancer (HNC) … distinguishing benign from malignant lesions”; “Discover … technologies that could complement currently available clinical methods (e.g. pathology)”; and “validate imaging-based applications and data analysis tools”. This tool could guide treatments, minimize unnecessary diagnostic interventions, and improve care in resource- constrained environments. PROJECT NARRATIVE: There is a critical need in oral healthcare to improve the pathological classification of those oral premalignant lesions that eventually progress to cancer from those that do not. In this proposal we plan to build a series of computational risk models using a form of artificial intelligence called deep learning to quantify oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC) progression risk directly from premalignancy digital pathology images. To accomplish this impactful task we will combine our clinical experience in oral pathology and OCSCC care, our leading-edge deep learning platform, and a multi-institutional data set of more than 4000 patient samples.",Deep learning for oral premalignancy evaluation,10427078,R56DE030958,"['Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biology ', ' Biopsy ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Evolution ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Histology ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hyperplasia ', ' Hyperplastic ', ' Methods ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Pathology ', ' Oral Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Publishing ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Stains ', ' Staining method ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Specialist ', ' oral lesion ', ' mouth lesion ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' tumor progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' improved ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Malignant ', ' Biological ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Head and Neck Cancer ', ' Malignant Head and Neck Neoplasm ', ' head/neck cancer ', ' malignant head and neck tumor ', ' dyscrasia ', ' Dysplasia ', ' Mild Dysplasia ', ' Moderate Dysplasia ', ' Severe dysplasia ', ' Pathologist ', ' Companions ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' Oral ', ' Slide ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Head and Neck ', ' Head and neck structure ', ' H and E ', ' Hematoxylin and Eosin ', ' Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method ', ' interest ', ' Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma ', ' Oral squamous cell carcinoma ', ' mouth SCC ', ' oral cavity SCC ', ' oral squamous cancer ', ' oral squamous carcinoma ', ' mouth squamous cell carcinoma ', ' computer imaging ', ' digital imaging ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Histopathology ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' Categories ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' HNSCC ', ' Head and Neck Carcinoma ', ' SCCHN ', ' head and neck squamous cell cancer ', ' Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma ', ' Institution ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' DNA mutation ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' genomic alteration ', ' DNA Sequence Alteration ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' NIDCR ', ' NIDR ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' precancerous ', ' premalignant ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' oral dysplasia ', ' oral premalignancy ', ' oral precancer ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' cancer invasiveness ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' predictive marker ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' histological specimens ', ' histological samples ', ' histology samples ', ' histology specimens ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' digital pathology ', ' pathology imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' multiple datasets ', ' multiple data sets ', ' computational pipelines ', ' learning classifier ', ' High grade dysplasia ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R56,2021,330611,IL-01
"Computational Toolkit for Normalizing the Impact of CT Acquisition and Reconstruction on Quantitative Image Features Quantitative image features (QIFs) such as radiomic and deep features hold enormous potential to improve the detection, diagnosis, and treatment assessment of a wide range of diseases. Generated from clinically acquired Computed Tomography (CT) scans, QIFs represent small pixel-wise changes that may be early indicators of disease progression. However, detecting these changes is complicated by variations in the way that CT scans are performed, including variations in acquisition and reconstruction parameters. Ensuring reproducible QIFs is a prerequisite for developing machine learning (ML) models that achieve consistent performance across different clinical settings. This project's premise is that QIFs are sensitive to CT parameters such as radiation dose level, slice thickness, reconstruction kernel, and reconstruction method. The combined interactions among these parameters result in unique image conditions, each yielding its own QIF value. Moreover, some clinical tasks and algorithms are more sensitive to differences in QIF values than others. We hypothesize that a systematic, task-dependent framework to normalize scans and mitigate the impact of variability in CT parameters will identify reproducible QIFs and yield more consistent ML models. Three interrelated innovations will be pursued in this work: 1) a novel framework for characterizing the impact of different acquisition and reconstruction parameters on QIFs and ML models using patient scans with known clinical outcomes in multiple domains; 2) a systematic approach for selecting an optimal mitigation technique and evaluating the impact of normalization; and 3) an open-source software toolkit that formalizes the process of CT normalization, addressing real-world use cases developed by academic and industry collaborators. In Aim 1, we will evaluate how multiple CT parameters influence QIF values and model performance. Utilizing metrics of agreement and a heat map-based visualization, we will determine under which image acquisition and reconstruction conditions the QIFs and model performance are consistent. In Aim 2, we will develop and validate a generative adversarial network-based approach to normalization. Our investigation will focus on targeted mitigation of the set of imaging conditions that are most relevant to a clinical task and on the optimization of how these models are trained. In Aim 3, we will engage a spectrum of external stakeholders to guide the development and adoption of a software toolkit called CT-NORM. Three distinct clinical domains will drive our efforts: lung nodule detection (which relies on identifying small regions of high contrast differences to identify nodules), interstitial lung disease quantification (which depends on characterizing texture differences), and ischemic core assessment (which relies on detecting low contrast differences in brain tissue). CT-NORM will provide the scientific community with an approach and a unified toolkit to characterize and mitigate the impact of reconstruction and acquisition parameters on QIFs and ML model performance. By addressing critical sources of variability, we will improve the process of generating QIFs and facilitate the discovery of precise and reproducible imaging phenotypes of disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Computed Tomography (CT) images play an integral role in screening and diagnosing diseases such as lung cancer, interstitial lung disease, and stroke. While artificial intelligence/machine learning models have been con- structed using quantitative image features, model performance can be affected by variations in how the CT images are acquired and reconstructed.

"NMR Fingerprinting: Leveraging optimal control pulse design, tailored isotope labeling, and machine learning to study intractable proteins Project summary Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is essential for the study structure, dynamics and function of proteins in near-native conditions. NMR studies have vital implications for therapeutic development. However, as the number of amino acids in the protein increases, NMR signals decay (relax) faster, yielding lower sensitivity and resolution, while the spectrum becomes more crowded. In these cases it is challenging to match observed signals to specific nuclei in the protein (called `resonance assignment') in order to meaningfully interpret NMR data. The overarching goal of our research is to push the boundaries of NMR enabling valuable insight about the dynamics and functions of currently intractable proteins. The objective of this project is to design an NMR platform consisting of coordinated, next-generation biochemical, biophysical, mathematical, and computational techniques. Our platform is built around an original approach to NMR spectroscopy in which new information about the local environment of each nucleus is encoded in the shape and pattern of its NMR signal. The rationale is that these patterns are a `fingerprint' – an intricate and unique signature that encodes key information about which atom is responsible for each resonance peak in the NMR spectrum. We will design and realize fingerprint patterns using two innovative approaches: 1) biochemically, by selectively introducing NMR-active isotopes into carefully chosen positions in the protein samples, and biophysically, and 2) by using specialized radiofrequency pulses to accurately control the quantum interactions that determine the NMR spectrum. The resulting fingerprints will be decoded using established algorithmic structures from machine learning, notably artificial neural networks. This will facilitate automated analyses that are accessible to non-NMR specialists. Our approach to spectroscopy holds promise in the study of therapeutically important proteins expressed in eukaryotic expression systems (e.g. G-protein coupled receptors and glycosylated proteins). Current NMR data from such proteins shows clear dynamics and interactions with other proteins, but cannot yet be properly interpreted because of the difficulty of relating each NMR peak to an amino acid in the protein sequence. Our platform will deliver two significant outcomes: 1) NMR resonance assignment for meaningful analyses of previously intractable systems. 2) Enable non-NMR specialists, to easily proceed from expressing their protein sample to using NMR to study dynamics and interactions via assigned spectra. This will have a positive impact on protein science and medical research. To support our mission we have assembled a team of leading experts to test our platform with their own protein systems. Project Narrative Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is used to study the structure, function, interactions, and dynamics of proteins, with important implications for therapeutic development. However, interpreting NMR information is extremely challenging and labor intensive, especially for large proteins, which produce many overlapping, weak NMR signals. We are developing next-generation methods in which key information is more clearly visible and accessible in the NMR data, using a highly coordinated platform of emerging biochemical, biophysical, mathematical, and computational techniques.","NMR Fingerprinting: Leveraging optimal control pulse design, tailored isotope labeling, and machine learning to study intractable proteins",10392661,R01GM136859,"['Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Structure ', ' G Protein-Complex Receptor ', ' G Protein-Coupled Receptor Genes ', ' GPCR ', ' G-Protein-Coupled Receptors ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Sampling ', ' NMR Spectrometer ', ' nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ', ' NMR Spectroscopy ', ' Data ', ' Protein Dynamics ', ' Resolution ', ' Therapeutic Studies ', ' Therapy Research ', ' Computational Technique ', ' protein function ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' quantum ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' therapeutic development ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' radio frequency ', ' radiofrequency ', ' artificial neural network ', ' artificial neural net ', ' computational neural network ', ' synthetic neural network ', ' automated analysis ', ' Algorithms ', ' Amino Acid Sequence ', ' Primary Protein Structure ', ' protein sequence ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Crowding ', ' Environment ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Goals ', ' Isotope Labeling ', ' Isotopes ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Science ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Spectrum Analysis ', ' Spectroscopy ', ' Spectrum Analyses ', ' Testing ', ' Medical Research ', ' Specialist ', ' Biochemical ', ' insight ', ' ']",NIGMS,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R01,2021,13250,MA-07
"Unsupervised optimization of protein therapeutics using closed-loop in vitro synthesis, nanosensing, and deep-learning Project Summary Overview of research: The Reuel Group at Iowa State University (founded Fall 2016) seeks to develop new materials, methods, and measurement devices for biomanufacturing, biotherapeutics, and biosensors. We have active work-streams in 1) optical nanosensors for protein binding, enzymatic activity, and cell membrane disruption, 2) scalable and reliable cell free protein synthesis (CFPS) methods for protein prototyping (extract and genetic template improvements), 3) microfluidics for droplet generation and measurement of CFPS products, interrogated by nanosensors, 4) algorithms for `big data' generated from nanosensors (machine learning and deep learning methods), 5) engineered endospores for time-delayed synthetic biology circuits, and 6) resonant radio frequency sensors for biomanufacturing, wound healing, and water quality. The overall vision of the research program is to simplify and improve the design and manufacturing of biological products (cells and proteins) for applications in therapies, advanced materials, and bio-electronics. Protein based therapies have demonstrated in clinic to be a potent tool in the treatment of many diseases. In recent years, the design, build, and test cycle to find therapies for new disease targets has improved dramatically using techniques such as surface display coupled to evolutionary selection. However, these mutagenic approaches have a few limitations, namely: 1) they require a suitable, naturally occurring sequence as a starting point, 2) they frequently optimize solely on a single desired feature, and 3) they operate as a `black box', meaning that generalizable design rules for in silico prediction of future products is not possible. It is the purpose of this MIRA for ESI research plan to design a closed-loop system that allows for unsupervised design and discovery of protein therapeutics that overcomes these limitations. Over the next five years we will build and integrate the system components which include enzymatic DNA synthesis coupled to cell free protein synthesis to rapidly prototype libraries of custom proteins in micro-droplet reactors. These proteins will then be characterized in the micro-droplets using optical nanosensors, to test for desired features such as stability, binding affinity, selectivity, hydrolytic activity, and/or membrane penetration. This will produce a large labeled data set (tying sequence to phenotypic properties) that can be used to train a deep learning neural network to self-determine sequence patterns for specific properties. Once the tuning coefficients of the network are found, the algorithm will then predict next best sequences which will be synthesized, tested, etc. such that the design loop progresses unsupervised until optimization criteria are met. This new approach will result in faster development of protein therapies that are optimized based on multiple criteria and not tied to existing, natural sequences. For patients this translates to more efficacious therapies with less side effects and a potential for reduced cost (due to shortened design timeline). At the end of the five-year project we will seek to translate this technology, via NIH SBIR funding, such that the new technology can make an impact on actual therapies. Project Narrative This project seeks to develop advanced tools to enable faster discovery and design of protein-based drugs for new disease targets. These tools would enable optimization of multiple parameters simultaneously, creating more potent therapies with less side effects. Thanks to speeding up the development cycle and reducing the time to market, these tools also have the potential to reduce end cost to patients.","Unsupervised optimization of protein therapeutics using closed-loop in vitro synthesis, nanosensing, and deep-learning",10252011,R35GM138265,"['Algorithms ', ' Biological Products ', ' Biologic Products ', ' Biological Agent ', ' biopharmaceutical ', ' biotherapeutic agent ', ' Biological Response Modifier Therapy ', ' Biologic Therapy ', ' Biological Therapy ', ' biological therapeutic ', ' biological treatment ', ' biotherapeutics ', ' biotherapy ', ' Cell membrane ', ' Cytoplasmic Membrane ', ' Plasma Membrane ', ' plasmalemma ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electronics ', ' electronic device ', ' Engineering ', ' Future ', ' In Vitro ', ' Iowa ', ' Libraries ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Protein Engineering ', ' genetic protein engineering ', ' protein design ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Technology ', ' Genetic Template ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' wound healing ', ' Wound Repair ', ' wound resolution ', ' Generations ', ' falls ', ' TimeLine ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Surface ', ' Penetration ', ' Training ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Protein Binding ', ' bound protein ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Stream ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' Ribosomal Peptide Biosynthesis ', ' Ribosomal Protein Biosynthesis ', ' Ribosomal Protein Synthesis ', ' protein synthesis ', ' Protein Biosynthesis ', ' water quality ', ' DNA Replication ', ' DNA Synthesis ', ' DNA biosynthesis ', ' biological sensor ', ' Biosensor ', ' Speed ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Devices ', ' Property ', ' native protein drug ', ' pharmaceutical protein ', ' protein drug agent ', ' therapeutic protein ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' µfluidic ', ' Microfluidics ', ' Therapeutic Uses ', ' Affinity ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' nanosensors ', ' nano sensing ', ' nano sensors ', ' nanosensing ', ' Coupled ', ' Biomanufacturing ', ' synthetic biology ', ' prototype ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' radio frequency ', ' radiofrequency ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' treatment optimization ', ' therapy optimization ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' side effect ', ' in silico ', ' efficacious treatment ', ' efficacious therapy ', ' ']",NIGMS,IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,363953,IA-04
"Generalizable Deep Learning Networks for Dual-tracer Amyloid/Tau PET/MRI Imaging of Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary  Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder and a major public health crisis, currently affecting over 5.8 million Americans and expected to rise as the population ages. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging can identify the hallmark proteinopathies of AD, including amyloid protein plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (composed primarily of tau protein) accumulating in the brain. While there is evident need for more PET neuroimaging, for example, to elucidate the sequence of amyloid and tau deposition in preclinical AD, its increased utility in longitudinal imaging studies with large study populations is limited by recruitment and cost. In particular, making multiple visits to the scanning site will be difficult for participants living far away, and the high cost of injected radiotracers will limit the scalability of PET studies.  In this project we propose using deep learning-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to enhance ultra-low-dose amyloid and tau PET for imaging AD. Our specific aims are (1) to validate the diagnostic value of the CNNs in actual ultra-low-dose amyloid and tau imaging sessions, with the injected dose as low as 1% of the original, and with actual ultra-low-dose data, to validate simulations for use in subsequent aims and future studies; (2) to apply the ultra-low-dose CNN to data collected on other PET systems and tracers, in order to demonstrate the CNN’s generalizability; and (3) to evaluate the value of deep learning-aided ultra-low-dose amyloid and tau PET for tracking cognitive decline in a preclinical AD population.  The innovation of this work lies in using multimodal imaging in addition to advanced machine learning techniques to enable acquisition of diagnostic-level PET images at extremely low dose levels. Performing actual ultra-low-dose PET acquisitions is also highly novel in itself. The outcome of this proposal is removing the limiting factors to large-scale clinical longitudinal imaging, shortening acquisitions spanning multiple days and visits to several hours in one visit with a successive ultra-low-dose and full-dose dual-tracer scan protocol. Significant dose reduction can also be achieved, allowing for more frequent amyloid/tau PET scanning. This flexibility will not only increase the utility of PET, aid longitudinal studies in dementia, but enable future comprehensive imaging of multiple PET-based biomarkers as these tracers are being developed. Project Narrative  More frequent PET scans can be used for dementia, a major cause of deaths in the United States, to understand the pathogenesis of the brain proteinopathies involved, to identify at-risk individuals, and to provide outcome markers for clinical trials of anti-amyloid/tau therapies; but recruitment for studies, cost, and radiation dose to the scanned participant are critical factors limiting its use. This work aims to train versatile deep learning-based neural networks which can produce diagnostic-level images from ultra-low-dose (as low as 1%) amyloid and tau PET acquisitions. Our study will provide flexibility in recruitment (running ultra-low-dose and full-dose scans in succession for dual-tracer studies), reduce the cost for radiotracer use, and reduce the dose in scanned participants, a “win-win” for researchers and patients.",Generalizable Deep Learning Networks for Dual-tracer Amyloid/Tau PET/MRI Imaging of Alzheimer's Disease,10214874,K99AG068310,"['Affect

"CT and CXR Phenotyping Platform for Assessing COVID-19 Susceptibility and Severity Abstract COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by WHO on March 11. Since then, there have been 8.15 million confirmed cases worldwide with a case fatality rate ranging from 16.3% to 0.1%. In the US, there have been 2,187,202 cases with a 5.4% case fatality rate as of June 16, 2020. The magnitude of this infectious disease has stressed the need to develop novel methodologies to define who are at the highest risk of developing acute symptoms. X-Ray (CXR) and Computed Tomography (CT) play a fundamental role in the detection and follow-up of the COVID-19 lung injury. It also provides a unique opportunity to define quantitative biomarkers that may identify susceptible subjects to the acute phase of the disease using pre-infection and early infection radiological exams. This proposal's broad objective is to provide a better understanding of acute COVID-19 susceptibility markers based on artificial intelligence approaches on radiological exams, both CT and CXR. CT offers a unique way to phenotype the lung and its changes. Subtle changes of normal parenchyma have been associated with systemic inflammation that can be detected on CT. We hypothesize that susceptible subjects for acute COVID- 19 disease evolution will express inflamed normal parenchymal signatures that can be measured on CT scan prior to the infection or in the early phases of the viral infection. We will develop new computational approaches to identify radiographic patterns consistent with inflamed normal parenchyma as well as early COVID-19 injury and compute radiomics signature that can capture the heterogeneity of the radiographic expression for each lung pattern. We will define new CT-based biomarkers for acute COVID-19 susceptibility using Gradient Boosting decision trees and feature importance. We will then translate the quantification of the most relevant features in CXR image using image translation approaches based on deep neural networks. Finally, we will integrate these automated tools in the CIP workstation using clinically friendly end-to-end workflows to empower clinical investigations across the world. We will continue the support and dissemination of this tool across the research community. Over the last 15 years, our group has developed the Chest Imaging Platform (CIP), an NIH-funded open-source software tool for the automated phenotyping of chest CT scans that is widely used in the chronic lung disease research community. Since the beginning of the pandemic, CIP has been used to the characterization of COVID-19 using existing densitometric metrics. Our commitment to open science in the form of open toolkits that are freely distributed is fundamental to catalyze the application of AI and imaging in the context of this pandemic. Project Narrative As of June 16, there has been 2.18 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the United States with 118,435 fatalities. Unlike many other diseases, only general epidemiological factors are available for describing the susceptibility to COVID-19 and its acute phase. Biomarkers computed from CT and CXR images of the chest provides a personalized approach to define prognostic markers of disease susceptibility.",CT and CXR Phenotyping Platform for Assessing COVID-19
