"Synthetic gene sensors and effectors to redirect organoid development Project Summary Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived organoids hold great promise for tissue engineering and personalized drug screening, but obtaining the desired multicellular organization and function from these systems is usually performed in an ad hoc fashion without forward design specification. Recently, we reported successful liver bud formation containing stromal cells, vascular tube-like structures and hematopoiesis-like processes by synthetically inducing diversity in GATA6 expression from a single hiPSC population. This accomplishment suggests that expanding circuit logic operations to artificially control differentiation drivers at particular bifurcations in lineage specification could profoundly impact the complexity and functionality of organoids. In this project, we bring together mathematical modeling, machine learning, optimization, and innovative synthetic biology techniques to elucidate and design fundamental decision and communication rules for guiding cells into complex, heterogeneous tissues. Our overarching hypothesis is that appropriate timing and predictable stochastic control of the expression of intracellular and extracellular factors is critical for redirecting lineage choices in order to elicit desired multicellular organization from a population of differentiating cells. We will develop synthetic tools for sensing differentiation stages of iPSC-derived organoids and construct and characterize a stochastic commitment switch in an inducible reporter system. These tools will be integrated in synthetic gene circuits for engineering emergent multicellular organization through stochastic temporal control of developmental factors. The modular commitment switches developed in this project will be capable of exploring how the degree of subpopulation biasing of cell fate decisions and level of cell fate synchronization at bipotent differentiation stages impacts self-assembly and emergent multicellular organization of an organoid. Our aims - executed through a closed loop of computational and experimental investigations - will shed insight on how generalizable methods of controlled manipulation can elicit desired organoid-level emergent properties. We will combine synthetic biology and advanced computational techniques to accelerate an ongoing revolution — the application of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to regenerative and personalized medicine. We will integrate new genetic circuits into hiPSCs that sense changes in endogenous gene expression and activate expression of other genes in order to redirect organoid differentiation to desired outcomes with specific 3D organization and arrangements of cell types and functions. Our design of sophisticated gene regulatory networks will be based on advanced optimization techniques rooted in control theory and machine learning, enabling precise and predictable generation of desired 3D structures and organoid functions.",Synthetic gene sensors and effectors to redirect organoid development,10155771,R01EB030946,"['Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Cadherins ', ' Cell Communication ', ' Cell Interaction ', ' Cell-to-Cell Interaction ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communication ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' computational simulation ', ' computerized simulation ', ' Endoderm ', ' Engineering ', ' Feedback ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Switch Genes ', ' Synthetic Genes ', ' Artificial Genes ', ' Hematopoiesis ', ' Hematopoietic Cellular Control Mechanisms ', ' blood cell formation ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Logic ', ' Mesoderm ', ' Methods ', ' Organoids ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Probability ', ' Proteins ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Generations ', ' Guide RNA ', ' gRNA ', ' Stromal Cells ', ' Tube ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Reporter ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' extracellular ', ' bioengineered tissue ', ' engineered tissue ', ' Tissue Engineering ', ' self organization ', ' Structure ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Regenerative Medicine ', ' Developmental Process ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' self assembly ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' 3-D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3D structure ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' synthetic biology ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' iPS ', ' iPSC ', ' iPSCs ', ' engineering design ', ' information processing ', ' stem cell population ', ' operation ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' control theory ', ' Growth Factor ', ' Growth Agents ', ' Growth Substances ', ' Proteins Growth Factors ', ' Drug Screening ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' precision drugs ', ' personalized drugs ', ' ']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,682610,MA-07
"High resolution mapping of the genetic risk for disease in the aging brain ABSTRACT Brain structure undergoes changes throughout life as part of the normal healthy aging process, yet some genetic factors embedded in our DNA are believed to alter and potentially accelerate the aging process within the brain. While numerous neuroimaging studies have aimed to map the genetics of dementia, differences in populations and approaches confounded with the small effect sizes attributable to any single genetic variant leads to inconsistencies in findings and limited resources to investigate the truth. Dozens of neuroimaging genetic studies have been collected around the world to help better understand the link. However, the independent nature by which the studies often operate may be limiting scientific advance. Instead of collecting new data to answer the same questions, we harmonize brain mapping efforts across existing studies and pool information to not only study differences between the healthy and demented brain, but also examine normal healthy aging trends, and determine the first signs of deviation, and map out the neurobiological effect of genes that confer risk for dementia. In our effort, we aim to pinpoint mechanistic trajectories and brain circuits by which the widely studied ApoE4 genetic haplotype affects brain throughout life. Despite being identified as a genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease over 20 years ago, the effects on the brain in populations around the world are remarkably inconsistent. With novel brain mapping techniques across tens of thousands of individuals across the lifespan, we will perform the most well powered brain mapping initiative and build necessary tools to invite other researchers from around the world to add confidence to the findings. We will also determine – with unprecedented power -- how the aggregate risk for AD promotes accelerated brain degeneration with novel expedited longitudinal linear mixed modeling techniques for large scale epidemiological genetic studies with repeat data. Our proposal brings together contributions from multidisciplinary collaborators with world renowned expertise in neurodegeneration, brain mapping, big data, artificial intelligence, epidemiology, genomics and epigenomes, statistical genetics, and molecular and biological psychiatry. Our technical expertise will provide resources for visualizing genetic results at the finest resolution and provide tools for researchers to use our harmonized analyses to structure their own aging hypotheses in populations of men and women around the world, and even target sex-specific hypotheses in aging. As new brain imaging and genetic data is becoming rapidly available, we provide the tools to harmonize the data into this workflow for years to come. Driven by the data sharing and reuse of this proposal, we provide a portal for researchers of today and tomorrow to access findings from all the studies incorporated in this proposal and add to the collective repository of effects. We hope our careful harmonization of data, along with novel mathematics, tools, and selection of targeted hypotheses will guide future collaborative studies for continuous reuse. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE Brain aging is a global health concern and a major focus of dozens of large scale research initiatives around the world. Here, we propose a paradigm to use advanced brain imaging techniques in a harmonized fashion across numerous existing datasets, and to map the underlying genetic influences driving neurodegeneration across tens of thousands of individuals. We will provide advanced brain image processing, mathematical tools, and a portal for researchers to access and add to findings.",High resolution mapping of the genetic risk for disease in the aging

"Assessment of ultrasound features of knee osteoarthritis in a population-based community cohort Project summary Our long-term goal is to demonstrate the utility of ultrasound for OA assessment, standardize its acquisition and scoring, and promote increased uptake of US for use in clinical, research, and trial settings. Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is highly prevalent and frequently debilitating. Development of potential treatments has been hampered by the heterogenous nature of this common chronic condition, which is characterized by a number of subgroups, or phenotypes, with different underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Imaging, genetics, biochemical biomarkers, and other features can be used to characterize phenotypes, but variations in data types can make it difficult to harmonize definitions. While radiography is widely used in KOA imaging, it is limited in its ability to assess early disease (when interventions are most likely to succeed) and is insensitive to change. Ultrasound (US) is a widely accessible, time-efficient and cost-effective imaging modality that can provide detailed and reliable information about all joint tissues (e.g., cartilage, meniscus, synovium, bone), and could therefore inform phenotypes in KOA (e.g., by presence of synovitis, effusion, cartilage damage, calcium crystal deposition, and popliteal cysts). Use of US is currently limited by the lack of systematically performed studies in well-characterized non-clinical populations. To address this gap and further the use of this advantageous imaging modality for KOA, we will obtain standardized US and radiography in the population- based Johnston County Health Study (JoCoHS), the new enrollment phase of the 25+ year Johnston County OA Project which includes white, African American, and Hispanic men and women aged 35-70, to achieve three aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the population prevalence (n~3000) of knee US features including cartilage and meniscal damage, synovitis/effusion, calcium crystal deposition, popliteal cysts and osteophytes overall and in key subgroups by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and symptom status. Aim 2 will allow quantification of the associations between these US features and radiographic findings and symptom scores overall and in key subgroups (e.g., those with and without radiographic KOA, by sex, by race/ethnicity). For Aim 3, we will apply novel machine learning methodologies (e.g., Direction-projection-permutation [DiProPerm] hypothesis testing, Joint and Individual Variation [JIVE], and Distance-Weighted Discrimination [DWD]) to a) develop an overall US score for symptomatic KOA and b) identify the contribution of US variables to phenotypes relevant to KOA based on general health, physical activity, and functional assessments. This study is a crucial step to establish the foundation for US as an assessment tool for clinical use, research, and clinical trials in KOA, providing unique population-based cross-sectional data regarding the utility of US and forming the basis for future longitudinal work evaluating its value and performance characteristics related to incident and progressive KOA. Project narrative Osteoarthritis is an enormous and increasing public health problem that, like many other chronic conditions, is not a single disease but a heterogeneous condition consisting of multiple subgroups, or phenotypes, with differing underlying mechanisms. Ultrasound is an accessible, time-efficient, and cost-effective imaging modality that provides invaluable data about all joint tissues involved in osteoarthritis and has the potential to identify important phenotypes. The proposed work is relevant to the NIAMS mission and represents a crucial step to establish the foundation for ultrasound as an assessment tool for use in clinics, research, and clinical trials in osteoarthritis.",Assessment of ultrasound features of knee osteoarthritis in a population-based community cohort,10158441,R01AR077060,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' bone ', ' Calcium ', ' Cartilage ', ' Cartilaginous Tissue ', ' Claustrophobias ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Crystallization ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' effusion ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Joints ', ' Knee ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mission ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' osteoarthritic ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Pathology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Popliteal Cyst ', "" Baker's Cyst "", ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Receiver Operating Characteristics ', ' Receiver Operator Characteristics ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Standardization ', ' Syndrome ', ' Synovial Membrane ', ' Membrana Synovialis Capsulae Articularis ', ' Synovium ', ' Synovitis ', ' inflamed synovial tissue ', ' inflamed synovium ', ' synovial inflammation ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Diagnostic radiologic examination ', ' Conventional X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic Radiology ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray Radiology ', ' Radiography ', ' Roentgenography ', ' X-Ray Imaging ', ' X-Ray Medical Imaging ', ' Xray imaging ', ' Xray medical imaging ', ' conventional Xray ', ' diagnostic Xray ', ' diagnostic Xray radiology ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' Hispanics ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Specialist ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biochemical ', ' Physical activity ', ' Meniscus structure of joint ', ' Meniscus ', ' Individual ', ' Bilateral ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' uptake ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' knee OA ', ' knee joint OA ', ' knee joint osteoarthritis ', ' Knee Osteoarthritis ', ' Clinic ', ' Crystal Deposition ', ' Crystal Formation ', ' Musculoskeletal ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' population-based study ', ' population-level study ', ' studies of populations ', ' study of the population ', ' Population Study ', ' Categories ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Modality ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Assessment Tool ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' point of care ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases ', ' NIAMS ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' Implant ', ' population based ', ' rheumatologist ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Bone Spur ', ' osteophyte ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' imaging genetics ', ' recruit ', ' individual variation ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variability ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Differences between sexes ', ' Differs between sexes ', ' Sexual differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIAMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,331837,NC-04
"New Jersey Alliance for Clinical Translational Science: NJ ACTS Contact PD/PI: Panettieri, Reynold Alexander Project Summary/Abstract Overview Coordinated by Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS), the New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science (NJ ACTS) comprises a consortium with Rutgers and Princeton Universities (PU), NJ Institute for Technology (NJIT), medical, nursing, dental and public health schools, hospitals, community health centers, outpatient practices, industry, policymakers and health information exchanges. All Alliance universities and affiliates have provided substantial resources and contributed to the planning, development and leadership of the consortium. With access to ~7 million people, NJ ACTS serves as a ‘natural laboratory’ for translational and clinical research. With a state population of ~9 million, New Jersey ranks 11th in the US, 1st in population density and higher than average in racial and ethnic diversity. Surprisingly, NJ has no CTSA Hub to coordinate translational and clinical research. Our CTSA Hub focuses on two overarching themes: the heterogeneity of disease pathogenesis and response to treatment, and the value of linking large clinical databases with interventional clinical investigations to identify cause-and-effect and predict therapeutic responses. NJ ACTS will provide: innovative approaches to link information from large databases and electronic health records to inform clinical trial design, execution and analysis; and novel platforms for biomarker discovery using fluorescence in situ hybridization and machine learning to identify unique neural signatures of chronic illness. NJ ACTS will access a large health system with significant member diversity; a rich legacy of community engagement and community-based research platforms; and proven approaches to enhance workforce development in clinical research. With a substantial investment in streamlining research administration and IRB practices at Rutgers and with the inception of NJ ACTS, there exists an unparalleled opportunity for logarithmic growth in clinical research in New Jersey. To build our capacity for participant and clinical interactions as a CTSA Hub, the newly established Trial Accelerator and Recruitment Office will coordinate feasibility assessment, implementation, recruitment, and evaluation of clinical studies. Additionally, our organization of five clinical research units into a cohesive network provides extraordinary expertise in strategic locations to enhance participant recruitment from diverse communities with a particular focus on: children; the elderly; those with serious mental illness or substance abuse issues; low-income individuals served by Medicaid; those with HIV/AIDS; and people of all ages who are minorities, underserved, and victims of health and environmental disparities. With a history of collaboration, partners and affiliates share unique skills, expertise, training and mentoring capabilities that will be greatly amplified within the infrastructure of a CTSA Hub. Princeton and NJIT, without medical schools or hospital affiliates, seeks collaboration with Rutgers to provide clinical research platforms; Rutgers seeks the PU and NJIT expertise in novel informatics platforms, expertise in natural language and ontology, machine learning and cognitive neurosciences. Together NJ ACTS will provide an alliance that will catalyze clinical research and training across New Jersey to improve population health and contribute to the CTSA Consortium. In this revised application, the overall themes remain unchanged but Cores leadership and direction has been markedly refined.

"Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention Given the difficulty of reversing obesity once present, there has been increasing focus on the primary prevention of obesity early in the lifecourse. Few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. This proposal summarizes a 5-year program of mentored professional development tied to a multi-method research project intended to improve the identification and potential treatment of infants and toddlers with high risk for obesity. My long-term goal is to prevent obesity by identifying infants at greatest risk and providing for them an effective, family-centered intervention that targets modifiable, life course factors. My central hypothesis, based on my prior research, is that identifying infants at risk for obesity prior to the onset of unhealthy weight gain will enable early intervention. My research plan aims to: (1) create risk prediction models for obesity at age 24 months by linking three existing data systems that combine birth certificate, contextual- level, and health outcome data; (2) test the feasibility of linking these data prospectively to validate the Aim 1 obesity risk prediction models over a 24-month period within a contemporary, clinical cohort; and (3) identify best approaches for family-focused risk communication regarding the prevention of excessive weight gain and obesity in infants and toddlers using a human-centered design approach. Through my career development plan and guidance from my mentors, I will expand upon a foundation in epidemiology and pediatric health services research to develop expertise in machine learning, health informatics, data integration, qualitative methods, human-centered design, and behavior change. Together, the research and educational aims of this proposal will provide me with the necessary groundwork to compete for additional funding as an independent investigator. Specifically, I will seek R03-level grant funding from the NIDDK in year 4 of my K01 award to test the communication strategy developed in Aim 3 and to partner with families to modify an existing behavioral change intervention for use in infancy. By the end of this award, I will be well positioned to apply for funding from the NIDDK to conduct a robust R01-level study that combines the validated prediction models, family- focused communication strategy, and modified intervention to determine whether we can effectively prevent obesity in those infants and toddlers identified as being at the highest risk. This line of research will help ensure that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them. I will accomplish this work under the mentorship of Dr. Aaron E. Carroll, a child health services researcher, and a multidisciplinary team of faculty with expertise machine learning, health informatics, data integration and surveillance, qualitative research, human-centered design approaches, behavior change, and childhood obesity. I am ideally suited to complete this research due to my past research productivity, current mentorship team, open access to health care data, and the established clinical decision support infrastructure at the Indiana University School of Medicine. Project Narrative Increasing evidence suggests that the infancy and toddler periods represent the best opportunity for obesity prevention, but few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. The current proposal seeks to develop practical methods to assess the risk of future obesity in infants and toddlers in the clinical setting, and to partner with families to explore new ways to communicate early life obesity risk in ways that account for their perceptions, concerns and beliefs. This proposal has the promise to lead to targeted, tailored interventions for infants most at-risk for obesity, ensuring that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them.",Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention,10135919,K01DK114383,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Award ', ' Belief ', ' Birth Certificates

"Proteogenomics-driven therapeutic discovery in hepatocellular carcinoma Project Summary  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and therapeutic options are limited. There is a pressing need to fully understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease in order to identify new effective biomarkers, drug targets, and therapeutic agents for the prognosis and treatment of HCC. Proteins are the functional molecules of the cell, and many clinically validated biomarkers and most drug targets are proteins; however, cancer omics studies have relied primarily on genomic platforms. By melding genomics with mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics, the new field of proteogenomics provides an opportunity to more completely understand how somatic genomes activate aberrant protein networks that drive cancer pathogenesis. A major National Cancer Institute (NCI)-funded initiative, the Clinical Proteomics Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), and the more recently established International Cancer Proteogenome Consortium (ICPC), are promoting an integrated proteogenomics approach that is postulated to produce sounder therapeutic hypotheses and a new generation of protein biomarkers. The central purpose of this application is to forge a collaboration between a CPTAC team in the US and an ICPC team in China to enable proteogenomics-driven therapeutic discoveries in hepatitis B virus-related (HBV+) HCC, which attributes to 85% of HCC cases in China. The two teams bring complementary expertise required for a successful proteogenomic study of HCC. The China team has already generated the most comprehensive multi-omics dataset yet produced for liver cancer by applying proteogenomic profiling to a Chinese HBV+ HCC cohort (CHCC-HBV) with 159 cases, and the data has been preliminarily analyzed through collaborative efforts between the two teams. In this application, the US team will perform deep computational analyses of the proteogenomics data to generate prognostic models and therapeutic hypotheses, which will be experimentally validated in cell lines, animal models, and clinical specimens by the China team. Our specific Aims are: Aim 1) To develop and validate a protein-based prognostic model; Aim 2) To identify and validate subtype-specific causal drivers and therapeutic strategies; and Aim 3) To characterize the immune landscape of HBV+ HCC. Successful completion of this project will lead to new knowledge on HCC biology as well as new prognostic and treatment strategies for HBV+ HCC. Meanwhile, experimentally validated computational methods developed in this project will have wide application to the study of other cancers and other non-cancer diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HBV+ HCC) attributes to 85% of all HCC cases in China, and therapeutic options are limited. This project will forge a collaboration between a computational team in the US and an HCC oncology team in China to perform comprehensive molecular characterization of a large Chinese HBV+ HCC cohort using the new proteogenomic approach that systematically integrates genomics and mass spectrometry-based proteomics data. This collaborative project will produce new biomarkers, drug targets, and therapeutic agents for the prognosis and treatment of HCC as well as experimentally validated computational methods that can

"Cognitive and Molecular Challenges to Statistical Inference Across Healthy Aging. Age-related cognitive decline is a problem of growing importance given the trend toward increased lifespan and the importance of cognitive function in determining risk for neurodegenerative disease. Despite the importance of this problem, the cognitive and molecular changes that mediate it are still poorly understood. While there are competing theories for the mediators of cognitive aging at both psychological and molecular levels, theories on aging and the research supporting them have typically focused on a single level of analysis. As our understanding of the biological basis for behavior grows, this divide becomes less sensible. Instead, psychological theory should be constrained according to its known biology, and biology should in turn inform psychological theory. Here I propose to learn neural network modeling and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) techniques in order to bridge human psychological theory that has been the focus of my recent work to the molecular level theory that was the focus of my post-baccalaureate training at the NIA. I will build from my recent work that highlights a key statistical problem faced by the brain: how to selectively pool information across relevant sources but partition information across irrelevant ones. I will closely examine the cognitive and molecular mechanisms that allow for efficient pooling and partitioning to test the overarching theory that, due to impaired glutamate and dopamine signaling, older adults develop a selective deficit in pooling relevant sources of information. I will test this theory in two separate paradigms: visual working memory (K99) and learning and perceptual inference (R00). During the K99 phase of the award I will examine how pooling information from visual targets with similar features can 1) improve effective memory capacity, 2) be achieved by a neural network model, and 3) be impaired by simulated molecular deficiencies (glutamate, dopamine, norepinephrine). This bridge between cognitive and molecular levels of analysis will be used to test whether age-related memory deficits are due to inefficient pooling and mediated by molecular deficits in glutamate and dopamine (as measured through MRS and behavioral proxy, respectively). During the R00 phase of the award I will use the training in neural networks and MRS provided in the K99 phase to examine how 1) pooling sequential pieces of information affects learning and perceptual bias, 2) efficient pooling and partitioning can be achieved by a neural network model and 3) these processes are disrupted by specific molecular deficiencies. The established relationships between statistical properties (sequential pooling and partitioning), psychological measurements (learning and perceptual bias) and molecular factors (glutamate, dopamine, and norepinephrine signaling levels) will be used to test whether age-related differences in learning and perceptual bias reflect deficient pooling mediated by local glutamate deficiency (as measured through MRS). Overall, this work will contribute a deeper and more detailed understanding of the psychological and molecular factors that interact to mediate age-related cognitive decline. In addition, the K99 training will provide me the tools necessary to link psychological and molecular levels of analysis and the R00 phase will build the foundations of my independent research laboratory allowing me to develop a successful scientific career driven by experiments that build and refine a unified understanding of cognitive aging. Project Narrative This project will explore how changes to basic information processing in the brain occurring over the course of healthy aging may contribute to age-related deficits in learning and memory. The work will also examine the biological underpinnings of these changes and may inform future research into interventions that could slow the cognitive aging process.",Cognitive and Molecular Challenges to Statistical Inference Across Healthy Aging.,10171740,R00AG054732,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Arousal ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Biology ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Stem ', ' Brainstem ', ' Comparative Study ', ' Decision Making ', ' Dopamine ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Foundations ', ' gamma-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' 4-Aminobutanoic Acid ', ' 4-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' 4-amino-butanoic acid ', ' Aminalon ', ' Aminalone ', ' GABA ', ' γ-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' Glutamates ', ' L-Glutamate ', ' glutamatergic ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybrids ', ' Joints ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ', ' MR Spectroscopy ', ' Maps ', ' Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Norepinephrine ', ' Levarterenol ', ' Levonorepinephrine ', ' Noradrenaline ', ' Perception ', ' Play ', ' Psychological Theory ', ' Psychologic Theory ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Task Performances ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' Age-associated cognitive decline ', ' Age-related cognitive decline ', ' Benign senescent forgetfulness ', ' age associated memory decline ', ' age related cognitive deficit ', ' age related cognitive impairment ', ' age related memory dysfunction ', ' Age-associated memory impairment ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' Performance ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Proxy ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' Reporting ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Property ', ' biological basis of behavior ', ' biopsychology ', ' psychobiology ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Cognitive ', ' trend ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Impairment ', ' comparative ', ' visual information ', ' healthy aging ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' information processing ', ' emerging adult ', ' early adulthood ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' glutamatergic signaling ', ' glutamate signaling ', ' glutamatergic dendrodendritic synapses ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' neural network ', ' Bayesian learning ', ' Bayesian machine learning ', ' ']",NIA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R00,2021,247426,RI-01
"Molecular modeling and machine learning for protein structures and interactions PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Structural biology provides a powerful lens through which to view living systems. With advances in algorithms and computing, molecular simulations have begun to complement traditional experimental approaches as tools for discovery. At the same time, data-intensive machine learning approaches are becoming increasingly important in biology, fueled by the rapid growth in high-throughput experimentation. Research in my laboratory applies techniques from structural biology, molecular simulation, and machine learning to design new protein structures and predict protein interactions. We design new protein structures in order to better understand the principles of protein folding and to create highly stable and robust molecular scaffolds for a range of biomedical applications including multivalent display of binding or signaling domains, hosting of binding or catalytic sites, and use as building blocks to assemble higher-order complexes. We predict protein interactions in order to better understand the principles of macromolecular recognition and to gain insight into the process by which the adaptive immune system discriminates self from non-self in the context of infectious and autoimmune diseases and cancer. Our research during the project period will be directed toward two broad goals: de novo design and functionalization of tandem repeat proteins, and prediction of peptide-MHC recognition by T cell receptors (TCRs). The proposed protein design work builds on our recent progress designing circular tandem repeat proteins with a range of repeat numbers and diameters and applying these designs as multivalent display scaffolds for the presentation of binding and signalling domains. Our TCR studies leverage the tools we have recently developed to model—structurally and bioinformatically—repertoires of T cell receptors and their peptide:MHC specificity. Looking ahead, I am optimistic that by combining atomically-detailed molecular simulations and data-intensive machine learning techniques we will be able to generate designed protein constructs and predictive algorithms that have a significant positive impact on human health. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project seeks to develop new computer algorithms for designing protein structures and predicting protein interactions. The rationally designed proteins that we create will have potential uses as molecular scaffolds in a wide range of biomedical applications including diagnostics and cellular therapies. By predicting the interactions between T cell receptors and antigens, we aim to better understand how the immune system discriminates self from non-self in the context of infectious and autoimmune disease and cancer.",Molecular modeling and machine learning for protein structures and interactions,10191763,R35GM141457,"['Algorithms ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune condition ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Biology ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Laboratories ', ' Structural Models ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Protein Engineering ', ' genetic protein engineering ', ' protein design ', ' Proteins ', ' T-Cell Receptor ', ' MHC Receptor ', ' Major Histocompatibility Complex Receptor ', ' Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell ', ' Research ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Tandem Repeat Sequences ', ' Tandem Repeats ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' protein folding ', ' insight ', ' cell mediated therapies ', ' cell-based therapeutic ', ' cell-based therapy ', ' cellular therapy ', ' Cell Therapy ', ' tool ', ' scaffolding ', ' scaffold ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' structural biology ', ' Molecular Modeling Nucleic Acid Biochemistry ', ' Molecular Modeling Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Molecular Models ', ' molecular modeling ', ' Catalytic Core ', ' Catalytic Region ', ' Catalytic Site ', ' Catalytic Subunit ', ' Catalytic Domain ', ' simulation ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Peptide-MHC ', ' Peptide-Major Histocompatibility Protein Complex ', ' pMHC ', ' Peptide/MHC Complex ', ' protein structures ', ' proteins structure ', ' protein structure ', ' Data ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' rapid growth ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Molecular Machines ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' Adaptive Immune System ', ' acquired immune system ', ' T-cell receptor repertoire ', ' TCR repertoire ', ' ']",NIGMS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R35,2021,291907,WA-07
"Quantitative analysis of estrogen and sleep deprivation-induced blood and lymphatic vascular remodeling in the brain system Abstract Numerous small vessels making up the central nervous system blood and lymphatic vascular networks are heterogeneous and region-specific dynamic structures, whose segments, position, shape and function can change in response to physiological and pathophysiological conditions. To date it has not been possible to integrate blood and lymphatic vascular elements and their microenvironment to achieve a holistic quantitative characterization of the combined brain and meningeal tissue-scale vascular networks, its structure and function in normal and disease states. This application proposes to develop microscopy- based high-throughput image analysis techniques for automated extraction of blood and lymphatic vascular networks enabling quantitative morphodynamic characterization of cerebrovascular microenvironment changes in two intracranial compartments – the brain and dura mater. The study will focus on new algorithms for precise region-specific microvessel registration, mosaicing, segmentation, fusion and colocalization for constructing large tissue scale spatially aligned dual blood/lymphatic vascular network structural maps in the animals of both sexes, as well as characterization of heterogeneities of microvascular networks, including blood and lymphatic vasculature, under estrogen and sleep deprivation (the conditions relevant to multiple cerebrovascular disorders) compared to physiological settings. In other words, advanced microscopy-based techniques will be used to image blood and lymphatic vessels at sub-micron resolution in dura mater and the brain, and then cutting-edge deep machine learning imaging analysis methods will be employed to segment and quantify these vessels, their geometry, vessel wall structure, functionality, and interrelationship. Detailed structural analysis of microvascular networks is essential for accurate evaluation of the distribution of physical forces, substrate delivery and tissue clearance of waste, as well as sex differences and consequences of intracranial networks remodeling under physiological and pathological conditions. This will create knowledge enabling a better understanding of the pathogenesis of vascular impairments under estrogen and sleep deprivation, identify common molecular mechanisms and the efficacy and effectiveness of different therapeutic treatments. Without the ability to construct total structural and functional blood/lymphatic vascular network maps from studies limited to individual tissue component parts, it is little wonder that translation from the molecular and cellular levels to the whole organ and system levels is deficient and hinders translational progress towards a comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiology associated with a range of neurological disorders. Detailed analysis of structural relationships of both blood and lymphatic circulation in the brain system will have a direct impact on our general understanding of vascular function in brain/meningeal communication, and the cause and resolution of numerous diseases resulting from intracranial vascular disorders including impact of sex hormone (estrogen) deprivation, sleep deprivation, migraines, stroke, multiple sclerosis, dural arterio-venous fistulae, intradural hygroma and hematoma, spontaneous cerebral spinal fluid leaks, and intradural aneurysms that can lead to the development of neurological and cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer's. Quantitative description of blood and lymphatic vessel network structures using image analytics and machine learning algorithms distributed as software tools will have broad applications to quantification of other thin complex curvilinear anatomical structures (i.e. nerves, neuronal circuits, neurons, and neuroglia). The new software for blood and vessel network measurement will enable translation of fundamental pathophysiological knowledge gained from this proposal towards the development and assessment of the effectiveness of treatments and therapeutic interventions to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability associated with a range of neurological disorders.",Quantitative analysis

"Macrophage Phenotype Transition as the Biological Mechanism of Chronic Wound Healing Treated with Non-Thermal, Non-Cavitational Therapeutic Ultrasound PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Chronic wounds affect approximately 6.5 million patients in the United States. Current standard protocols for wound management do not guarantee healing and focus on maintaining a wound environment that is conducive to passive self-healing. Hence, there is a need to develop alternative treatments that promote active healing and shorten healing time leading to reduced costs. We have previously reported that treatment with low-frequency (20-100 kHz), low-intensity (50-150 mW/cm2) ultrasound (LFLI US) significantly (p<0.03) reduces venous ulcer size in vivo as compared to wounds treated with a sham device. This proposal aims at determining the biological mechanisms by which LFLI US promotes chronic wound healing in vitro. There is evidence that the cause of impaired healing is the dysregulation of macrophage phenotype, especially the defective transition from pro- inflammatory (M1) to pro-healing (M2) macrophages. Our characterization of tissue debrided from chronic wounds has shown that healing chronic wounds contain higher proportions of M1-like than M2- like macrophages. Additionally, the signaling protein Rac2, downstream of integrin and focal adhesion kinase activation, is a key regulator of mechanotransduction in macrophages and facilitates the transition of macrophages from the M1 to M2 phenotype. The proposed study will systematically examine the effects of LFLI ultrasound on macrophage phenotype, using macrophages cultured in three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds. We hypothesize that LFLI US directly and indirectly stimulates the transition of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages to pro-healing M2 macrophages via Rac2. This project will enhance our understanding of chronic wound healing and the potential of therapeutic ultrasound to accelerate healing. Aim 1 will elucidate the direct effects of LFLI US on macrophage function and phenotype by treating inflammatory macrophages directly with LFLI US and characterizing functional changes (proliferation, migration, and phagocytosis), protein/cytokine secretion, and gene expression. Concurrently, we will validate Rac2 as the potential mechanotransduction pathway which promotes M1 to M2 macrophages transition by analyzing integrins, focal adhesion kinases, and Rac2 via confocal microscopy and RNA characterization. [Aim 2 will validate the in vitro findings from Aim 1 using our previously developed diagnostic M1/M2 score on debrided tissue from chronic wound patients treated with LFLI US.] Aim 3 will elucidate the indirect effects of LFLI US on macrophage function and phenotype via a 3D macrophage fibroblast co-culture. The results of this study will inform the optimal design of LFLI ultrasound therapy protocols, lead to a personalized, active treatment for chronic wounds, accelerate chronic wound healing, and contribute to reduced annual wound care costs. Project Narrative Chronic wounds currently affect approximately 6.5 million patients in the United States and an excess of 25 billion dollars is spent annually on treatment. Current standards of care for chronic wounds, including months of weekly re-dressings and debridement, fails to guarantee active wound healing or closure. To address this issue, we propose to determine the biological mechanism responsible for therapeutic ultrasound mediated healing, low-intensity (<100mW/cm2), low-frequency (20kHz) ultrasound that has been shown to accelerate chronic wound closure in pilot clinical studies.","Macrophage Phenotype Transition as the Biological Mechanism of Chronic Wound Healing Treated with Non-Thermal, Non-Cavitational Therapeutic Ultrasound",10137782,F31AR074847,"['Adhesions ', ' Affect ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Debridement ', ' Sterile coverings ', ' Dressing ', ' Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay ', ' ELISA ', ' Exhibits ', ' Extracellular Matrix ', ' Cell-Extracellular Matrix ', ' ECM ', ' Fibroblasts ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Inflammation ', ' Integrins ', ' Integrins Extracellular Matrix ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' macrophage ', ' Mφ ', ' Patients ', ' Phagocytosis ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' Ultrasonic Therapy ', ' ultrasound energy ', ' ultrasound therapy ', ' United States ', ' Varicose Ulcer ', ' Venous Ulcer ', ' wound healing ', ' Wound Repair ', ' wound resolution ', ' Focal Adhesion Kinase 1 ', ' PTK2 Protein Tyrosine Kinase 2 ', ' endogenous substrate pp120 ', ' focal adhesion kinase ', ' focal adhesion protein tyrosine kinase ', ' focal adhesion-associated protein tyrosine kinase pp125FAK ', ' cytokine ', ' Mediating ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Stimulus ', ' Confocal Microscopy ', ' Coculture Techniques ', ' Co-culture ', ' Cocultivation ', ' Coculture ', ' Therapeutic ', ' angiogenesis ', ' Inflammatory ', ' scaffolding ', ' scaffold ', ' Diagnostic ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Frequencies ', ' human tissue ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' cell type ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Diabetic wound ', ' diabetes ulcer ', ' diabetic skin wound ', ' diabetic ulcer ', ' rac2 gene product ', ' rac2 protein ', ' rac2 GTP-binding protein ', ' RNA analysis ', ' Self Heal ', ' Xiakucao ', ' Prunella vulgaris ', ' Signaling Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Signaling Pathway Gene ', ' Signaling Protein ', ' Address ', ' in vivo ', ' Process ', ' active method ', ' active technique ', ' active treatment ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' cost ', ' healing ', ' knock-down ', ' knockdown ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' wound ', ' tissue wound ', ' wounding ', ' wounds ', ' Chronic Care ', ' migration ', ' alternative treatment ', ' chronic wound ', ' chronic skin wound ', ' three dimensional cell culture ', ' 3D cell culture ', ' 3D culture ', ' mechanotransduction ', ' mechanosensing ', ' wound closure ', ' care costs ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' wound care ', ' wound assessment ', ' wound monitoring ', ' wound treatment ', ' treat wound ', ' wound management ', ' wound therapeutics ', ' wound therapy ', ' wound environment ', ' Impaired healing ', ' Healing abnormal ', ' Healing delayed ', ' behavioral phenotyping ', ' behavior phenotype ', ' ']",NIAMS,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,46036,PA-03
"Systems biology of quiescence entry Abstract This proposal aims to provide crucial training for the candidate’s long-term career plan to study how cellular quiescence is established through decision-making processes. The decision to undergo quiescence in response to stress or developmental signals is a fundamental and understudied property of living systems. Failure to maintain quiescence can lead to cell proliferation disorders in humans, such as fibrosis or cancer. Quiescence entry is triggered when multiple nutrient- and stress-sensing signaling pathways arrest the cell cycle machinery. However, the molecular mechanisms that coordinate stress response pathways with the cell cycle during quiescence remain largely unclear. This is, in part, due to the difficulties to simultaneously quantify multiple stress pathways at the single cell level in vivo. To solve this limitation, the candidate will use a microfluidics- fluorescent imaging system that tracks up to six different pathways simultaneously during the transition from proliferation into quiescence. Using this approach, the coordination between stress responses and the cell cycle machinery can be quantified with unprecedented temporal resolution in the model organism S. cerevisiae. A computational platform based on machine learning and time series analysis will be used to process the large imaging data derived from tracking six biomarkers simultaneously in single cells. An initial version of this framework found that during the onset of quiescence the nuclear levels of the conserved DNA-replication kinase Cdc7 are dynamically regulated. This approach also identified that the nuclear levels of the stress-activated transcriptional repressor Xbp1 define how the cell cycle is stopped during quiescence entry. Combining this computational approach with biochemical techniques will determine the molecular mechanisms for the establishment of cellular quiescence by modulation of stress responses and the cell cycle machinery. The candidate is to acquire crucial training in computational biology during the K99 phase of this proposal to complement his previous training in biochemistry, cell biology and yeast genetics. The candidate will be mentored by a leader in computational biology Dr. Gaudenz Danuser, whose lab develops advanced machine learning and time series analysis to study cellular signal transduction. This proposal harnesses the commitment of an entire bioinformatics core facility and the training environment of a world-class research institution at UTSW. Establishing a unique computational and imaging framework, combined with biochemical approaches for the study of quiescence, will support the candidate’s transition to an independent research academic position and will lead to the discovery of biomedically relevant principles of quiescence and cell cycle regulation. Narrative The precise integration of stress signals during the establishment of cellular quiescence is crucial to prevent cell proliferation disorders, such as fibrosis and cancer. However, it is unclear how stress responses are integrated during quiescence, in part, because of a lack of methods for simultaneously quantifying multiple stress pathways in single cells. To solve this problem, the proposed work will combine machine learning approaches with six color fluorescent microscopy to reveal the mechanisms by which stress responses coordinate

"Development of Non-Human Primate Models to Assess Immunological Mechanisms and Antigenic Targets of Protective Sporozoite (SPZ) Vaccines and Establish Superior Efficacy of Next Generation SPZ vaccines ABSTRACT Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) sporozoite (SPZ)-based vaccines have shown excellent safety and vaccine efficacy (VE) in more than 25 clinical trials in Africa, Europe, and the US; Phase 3 assessment will begin in mid-2020. Our goal during the next decade is to develop, license, and deploy next generation SPZ vaccines with increased breadth, magnitude, and/or durability of VE and decreased cost of goods. Current assays and animal models do not offer an alternative to clinical trials for demonstrating whether a vaccine candidate exhibits superior performance to current SPZ vaccines. In this project we aim to develop in vitro assays and/or non-human primate (NHP) models that indicate a vaccine recipient will be protected against Pf malaria by a SPZ vaccine, and use them to show superiority of new SPZ vaccines. Success could come from increased understanding of the 1) immunological effector mechanisms of protective immunity (PI), 2) antigenic targets of PI, and/or 3) organs and cells involved in induction of the PI. Despite many studies, our understanding of these 3 areas has only modestly improved in the last 2 decades. In 2000 it was hypothesized that antigen-specific, tissue resident CD8+ T cells in the liver that recognized Pf peptides bound to class I HLA molecules on the surface of Pf-infected hepatocytes were the key cells mediating PI. This hypothesis led to a seminal study that demonstrated subcutaneous administration of PfSPZ Vaccine did not lead to induction of PfSPZ-specific, CD8+ T cells in the livers of immunized NHPs, but intravenous (IV) administration did. Based in large part on these results, a clinical trial of IV administration was initiated, and the trial showed 100% VE. Subsequently, >25 clinical trials of PfSPZ vaccines have shown that empirical alteration of PfSPZ/dose, number of doses, interval between doses, and method of attenuation can improve performance of PfSPZ vaccines. However, we have learned little about mechanisms and targets of PI, or the tissues involved in induction of PI. We believe this is because the effector activity takes place in the liver, and induction of PI also takes place in the central compartment, which is inaccessible in humans. Since our last major advance came from studying the livers of immunized NHPs, we think much more information can be gleaned from this approach, including elucidation of immunological effectors and targets, and comparison and down-selection of vaccine candidates. Therefore, in this project we will develop 3 models in outbred NHPs to study SPZ vaccine-induced immunity, and use the data generated in the models and systems biology assays to establish biomarkers and groups of assays (signature) that consistently predict whether a NHP will be protected, and establish blood surrogates of tissue markers. The best assays/ biomarkers/signatures will be assessed using serum, plasma, and PBMCs from protected/unprotected subjects assessed in clinical trials of PfSPZ vaccines. Finally, we will use the assays/biomarkers/signatures and model systems to screen newly developed SPZ vaccines, especially genetically altered vaccines, to down-select which should move to process development and clinical testing. PROJECT NARRATIVE Malaria affects over two billion people, killing over 400,000 individuals each year mostly children in Africa. A powerful tool is needed for eliminating Plasmodium falciparum malaria from defined geographical areas. The ideal tool would be a highly effective, long-acting vaccine that prevents infection, and thereby disease and parasite transmission. There is currently no alternative to clinical trials for demonstrating that a vaccine candidate exhibits performance superior to current SPZ vaccines Therefore, in this project we will develop in vitro assays and/or non-human primate (NHP) models that indicate if a human will be protected against Pf infection by a SPZ vaccine, and use them to show superiority of new SPZ vaccines.",Development

"Methods for Evolutionary Genomics Analysis Summary/Abstract Continuing advances in nucleotide sequencing have resulted in the assembly of datasets containing large numbers of species, genes, and genomic segments. Phylogenomic analyses of these data are essential to progress in understanding evolutionary patterns across the tree of life, and are finding increasing numbers of applications in practical analyses that require understanding of how patterns change over time. The sheer size of phylogenomic datasets limits the practical utility of available methods due to excessive time and memory requirements. We have developed many high impact methods and tools for comparative analysis of molecular sequences, a tradition we propose to continue through this MIRA project by developing innovative methods that address new challenges in phylogenomics. We will focus on pattern-based approaches of machine learning with sparsity constraint (SL) applied to phylogenomics, as a complement to traditional model-based methods in molecular evolution and phylogenetics. In the proposed SL in Phylogenomics (SLiP) framework, we will build models that best explain the biological trait or evolutionary hypothesis of interest, with genomic loci, such as genes, proteins, and genomic segments, serving as model parameters. Preliminary results from two example applications establish the premise and promise of a general SLiP framework. In one, SLiP successfully detected loci whose inclusion in a phylogenomic dataset overtakes a consistent and contrasting signal from hundreds of other loci when inferring phylogenetic relationships. In the other example, SLiP revealed loci and biological functional categories that harbor convergent sequence evolutionary patterns associated with the emergence of the same trait in distinct evolutionary lineages. In all of these analyses, SLiP required only a small fraction of the computational time and memory demanded by traditional methods, and it enabled better evolutionary contrasts with fewer assumptions. Consequently, the successful development of SLiP will improve the feasibility, rigor, and reproducibility of large-scale data analysis. It will also democratize big data analytics via shortened analysis time and a relatively small memory footprint, and encourage the development of a new class of methods for phylogenomic analysis. This framework will be accessed from a free library of SLiP functions, which will be directly useable via command line and available in a graphical interface through integration with the MEGA software. Narrative The long-term goal of my research program is to develop methods and tools for comparative analysis of molecular sequences. In this project, we will develop a new class of phylogenomic methods based on sparse machine learning and benchmark their absolute and relative performance. New techniques and their software implementation will greatly facilitate data analyses that are vital for evolutionary and functional genomics.",Methods for Evolutionary Genomics Analysis,10086181,R35GM139540,"['Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Libraries ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Research ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Time ', ' Trees ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Molecular Evolution ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' trait ', ' Categories ', ' Protein Gene Products ', ' Gene Proteins ', ' Modeling ', ' functional genomics ', ' Genomics ', ' Address ', ' Molecular Analysis ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' genomic region ', ' Phylogenetic Analysis ', ' Phylogenetics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' graphical user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' software user interface ', ' comparative ', ' Big Data Methods ', ' Big Data Analytics ', ' Big Data Tools ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' genomic locus ', ' gene locus ', ' genetic locus ', ' ']",NIGMS,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R35,2021,396250,PA-02
"Biomarkers of Alcoholic Hepatitis Abstract Our overarching goal is to develop minimally invasive approaches to better predict outcome and novel mechanisms in alcoholic hepatitis (AH). AH is characterized by acute hepatic decompensation and multiple organ failure. Although supportive care for AH has improved, short-term mortality has largely remained unchanged (30-40%) for decades. Effective approaches to predict risk hamper the treatment of AH. The hepatic extracellular matrix (ECM) responds dynamically to organ injury and ECM turnover increases; we propose to take advantage of this to develop new biomarkers for AH. The peptidome, low molecular weight peptides in biologic fluids, includes not only synthesized peptides, but fragments of degraded proteins (i.e., ‘degradome’). We hypothesize that the ECM degradome in plasma will yield new biomarkers to predict outcome and mechanisms in AH. We will test this hypothesis via the following Specific Aims: 1). To identify key changes in the peptidome as predictive biomarkers of outcome in AH. Unbiased peptidomics and multivariate analyses will identify degradomic features independently linked to prognosis. Protease activity that could produce significantly changed peptides will be predicted using Proteasix. We will also determine the mechanistic role of ECM turnover in the in parallel established models of alcohol-induced liver injury. 2) To develop probabilistic graphical models to predict outcome in AH. Whereas we expect the results of Aim 1 to establish that the peptidome profile in patients correlates with overall outcome, biomarkers alone are often insufficient to accurately predict individual patient outcome. We will therefore employ machine learning methods like probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) over mixed data types to integrate peptidomic and individual patient clinical data, into a single probabilistic graphical framework. The resulting graphs will then be used to infer causal interactions between variables, select informative biomarkers that will more specifically predict the outcome, and gain new mechanistic insight into the biology of AH (hypothesis generation). 3) To validate the use of the peptidome as a predictive tool for determining outcome in AH. Using a large prospectively-designed patient cohort with established outcomes, we will test the ability of the algorithms and biomarkers generated in this study to predict outcome. The successful completion of the proposed work will produce significant results at various levels: (1) Biomarker discovery: we will identify biomarkers and conditional biomarkers for AH prognosis. (2) Mechanistic understanding of AH: our models will generate hypotheses about the interactions between variables at different scales (molecular, individual) that will provide insights on the proteins that are involved in AH. (3) Algorithm development: through this project we will extend our mixed data graph learning algorithms to include censored variables (i.e., survival data). As a result of the above, this project is likely to yield novel diagnostic tools for AH that may also translate to other liver diseases. Narrative Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is a severe acute form of alcoholic liver disease with a very high mortality rate. Despite years of research, the standard-of-care and mortality rate has not changed dramatically in over 50 years. Our goal is to develop new computational and experimental methods and discover new biomarkers for AH outcome that can efficiently identify at-risk individuals. A second goal of the project is to identify molecular mechanisms of AH, which could be targeted therapeutically.",Biomarkers of Alcoholic Hepatitis,10170180,R01AA028436,"['Alcohols ', ' Alcohol

"Dissecting the mechanism of cell migration at the systems level Project Summary/Abstract Cell migration is required for many important physiological and pathological processes such as embryonic development, wound healing, and cancerous invasion. As a process that involves concerted action of multiple ensembles of molecules over the length of the entire cell, cell migration cannot be understood using conventional molecular approaches alone without considering sensing, actuation, and control at the whole cell level. This project seeks to approach migrating cells in a top-down manner as an integrated mechanochemical system. Based on observations that likely represent the manifestation of a complex network of molecular interactions, we may deduct how the underlying machine operates. The project will be facilitated by the development of new technologies, including 3D printing of polyacrylamide hydrogels and machine learning for cell tracking, traction force microscopy, and super resolution imaging. We will address three important aspects. First, we will ask how cells initiate migration through a process known as symmetry breaking, which causes a symmetrically spreading cell to initiate directional migration. We will examine various anisotropic properties of the substrate as potential symmetry breaking cues. In addition, the function of filopodia as possible sensors for symmetry breaking will be studied with imaging and pharmacological approaches. Second, we will address several poorly understood aspects of 2D and 3D cell migration. By following migrating cells over a long distance at a high magnification, we expect to place the newly discovered process of contact following in the context of cell collectives. To understand how cell shape control, cell-cell interaction, and cell migration respond to 3D environment, we will use 3D printed polyacrylamide to create model systems and systematically vary geometrical and mechanical parameters. We will then extend the experiments to decellularized lung scaffolds, which have been used for tissue engineering, to determine how migration characteristics in 3D is related to the promotion of tissue formation. Another overlooked area we will examine is the function of the tail in defining cell polarity and mediating contact following. Third, we will seek mechanistic understanding of cellular responses to cyclic stretching, which occurs in various tissues. A novel imaging approach will allow us to determine the responses during the stretching and relaxation phase respectively. A combination of experimentation and computer modeling is planned to explain why epithelial cells respond to static stretching along the direction of forces but perpendicularly in response to cyclic stretching. We will also test the hypothesis that responses to cyclic stretching can cause cell intercalation, a fundamentally important process in embryonic morphogenesis. We expect our results to complement studies at the molecular level and bring paradigm shifting insights into cell migration for both basic cell biology and repair of tissue functions. Project Narrative This project seeks to fill important gaps of knowledge in cell migration, which is essential for many physiological and pathological processes such as embryonic development, wound healing, and cancerous invasion. We will use a top-down approach that treats migrating cells as an integrated mechanical system, and we are developing technologies such as 3D printing and artificial intelligence for fabricating experimental environments, following cell movements, and imaging interactions in 3D scaffolds. Knowledge in how migrating cells interact with the environment and with each other is expected to further our abilities to counter diseases and restore body functions.",Dissecting the mechanism of cell migration at the systems level,10153827,R35GM136345,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Cell Communication ', ' Cell Interaction ', ' Cell-to-Cell Interaction ', ' cell motility ', ' Cell Locomotion ', ' Cell Migration ', ' Cell Movement ', ' Cellular Migration ', ' Cellular Motility ', ' Motility ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Cues ', ' Deductibles ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Environment ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Morphogenesis ', ' morphogenetic process ', ' Pathologic Processes ', ' Pathological Processes ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Physiological Processes ', ' Organism-Level Process ', ' Organismal Process ', ' Physiologic Processes ', ' Relaxation ', ' Tail ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' wound healing ', ' Wound Repair ', ' wound resolution ', ' polyacrylamide ', ' Cell Polarity ', ' cellular polarity ', ' Mediating ', ' polyacrylamide hydrogels ', ' Cell Shape ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' insight ', ' scaffolding ', ' scaffold ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' cell biology ', ' Cellular biology ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' bioengineered tissue ', ' engineered tissue ', ' Tissue Engineering ', ' Stretching ', ' Filopodia ', ' novel ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Resolution ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' migration ', ' Cancerous ', ' intercalation ', ' tissue repair ', ' 3D Print ', ' 3-D print ', ' 3-D printer ', ' 3D printer ', ' 3D printing ', ' three dimensional printing ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' imaging approach ', ' imaging based approach ', ' Traction Force Microscopy ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NIGMS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,339635,PA-18
"The plasticity of well-being:  A research network to define, measure and promote human flourishing PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This U24 application is written in response to RFA-AT-20-003 to establish a high-priority research network on emotional well-being (EWB). While psychological research on well-being has dramatically increased over the past 15 years, virtually all of this work has been descriptive and has not emphasized the “how” of well-being: How might well-being be cultivated? In addition, virtually all of the extant work on the correlates of individual differences in well-being has used responses on retrospective questionnaires as the primary tool to assess well-being. While there have been exciting findings, particularly relating individual differences in well-being to various indices of physical health, many questions remain and methodological limitations plague the validity of this work. This U24 network will assemble a highly multi-disciplinary group of 10 investigators across 3 (or more in the future) institutions to significantly advance our understanding of the “how” of EWB, identify the core plastic constituents of EWB, specify and/or develop robust measures of these constituents at biological, behavioral and experiential levels of analysis and characterize the plasticity of these constituents. The measurement strategy will ultimately focus on the development of technology-based passive measures of EWB that require no explicit user input and are highly scalable. The network will also focus its efforts on the development and evaluation of programs to train EWB and will assess whether such programs might serve as prevention strategies. The network will consist of scientists and scholars from a broad range of fields including psychology, neuroscience, electrical and computer engineering, population health and biology, computer science and the humanities. These scientists and scholars will focus on the following major aims: Aim 1: To arrive at a core consensus of the minimal set of constituents that can be described and measured at biological, behavioral and experiential levels that constitute the plastic elements of EWB and to specify already existing measures and /or develop novel measures of each of these constructs at each level of analysis. Aim 2: Using the active measures described in Aim 1, to develop passive measures using digital technologies of at least two of the core constituents of well-being. Aim 3: To develop pilot projects specifically focusing on prevention strategies for learning well-being in various samples. The network will train new investigators and bring established investigators into this new field, disseminate a framework for understanding the plasticity of well- being, a toolbox of measures for assessing the plasticity of components of well-being, and several pilot datasets that showcase the novel passive and field-friendly biological measures. In these ways, the network will dramatically accelerate progress in the nascent field of EWB. PROJECT NARRATIVE This U24 network on emotional well-being (EWB) will catalyze the emerging field of the plasticity of well-being and will showcase how well-being can be learned and the consequences of such skill development on physical and emotional health and on prevention of disease. A framework for understanding how well-being can be learned along with measures of the core components of well-being that can be learned will be developed and disseminated. The network will also train new investigators in this area and will engage established investigators to contribute to this field.","The plasticity of well-being:  A research network to define, measure and promote human flourishing",10151850,U24AT011289,"['Program Evaluation ', ' Psychology ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Technology ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Distal ', ' Area ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Biological ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Training ', ' Measurement ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Consensus ', ' Research Priority ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Emotional well being ', ' Feels well ', ' Normal mental condition ', ' Normal mental state ', ' Normal psyche ', ' Psychological Well Being ', ' Sense of well-being ', ' emotional wellbeing ', ' mental well-being ', ' mental wellbeing ', ' psychological wellbeing ', ' psychological wellness ', ' self wellness ', ' sense of wellbeing ', ' Well in self ', ' Techniques ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' meetings ', ' computer science ', ' tech development ', ' technology development ', ' novel ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' member ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Regulation ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Interruption ', ' Population Biology ', ' Subgroup ', ' To specify ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' digital ', ' Outcome ', ' Mind ', ' Individual Differences ', ' skill acquisition ', ' skill development ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' standard measure ', ' mindfulness meditation ', ' population health ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' Attention ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' abuses drugs ', ' Elements ', ' Engineering ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Future ', ' Gold ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Humanities ', ' indexing ', ' Literature ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Plague ', ' Yersinia pestis disease ', ' ']",NCCIH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,U24,2021,620542,WI-02
"Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity ABSTRACT - Overall The overall goal of the Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity Center in the Cancer Systems Biol- ogy Consortium (M2CH-CSBC Center) is to improve management of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) by developing systems level strategies to prevent the emergence of cancer subpopulations that are resistant to treatment. We postulate that heterogeneity arising from epigenomic instability intrinsic to cancer cells and di- verse signals from extrinsic microenvironments in which cancer cells reside are root causes of resistance. We will learn how intrinsic and extrinsic factors influence differentiation state, proliferation and therapeutic re- sponse in TNBC through experimental manipulation and computational modeling of cancer cell lines, 3D engi- neered multicellular systems, xenografts and clinical specimens. We will deploy single cell `omic and imaging technologies that allow quantitative assessment of molecular, cellular, and structural heterogeneity. We will interpret these data using computational models that define control networks and structures in heterogeneous systems as well as transitions between states of therapeutic resistance and sensitivity. This will be accom- plished in three related Projects and three Cores. Project 1 will focus on measuring and managing resistance- associated heterogeneity intrinsic to cancer cells. Project 2 will focus on identifying resistance-associated sig- nals from the microenvironment and on mitigating effects from these signals on therapeutic response. Project 3 will apply spatial systems biology approaches to TNBC specimens and multicell type models thereof to dis- cover molecular control networks that influence how cell intrinsic plasticity and microenvironment signaling al- ter therapeutic responses in complex tissues. All three Projects will include analysis of 5 core cell lines (HCC1143, HCC1599, MDA-MB-468, SUM149PT, and HCC1806), 5 patient derived cultures, and 6 FDA ap- proved, pathway-targeted drugs (afatinib, ruxolotinib, trametinib, BYL719, cabozantinib, and everolimus). The computational network discovery, data integration, spatial systems analysis and modeling approaches are the same in all Projects and serve to integrate the work of the overall M2CH-CSBC Center. Multiple integrative computational strategies are proposed to identify candidate heterogeneity control networks. These include analysis of existing genomic, epigenomic, pharmacologic response, and metabolomic characteristics of prima- ry tumors and models thereof. An Imaging Management and Analysis Core will provide infrastructure and image analytics that will enable efficient image data management, quantitative analysis of image features, and visualization of images and metadata generated using multiscale light and electron microscopy. An Outreach Core will make educational materials, experimental and computational tools and data available to the CSB Consortium, to the CSBC/PS-ON Coordinating Center and to the broader scientific community. An Administrative Core serves as the organization, integration, and evaluation hub of the M2CH-CSBC Center.

"Automated, model-guided phenotyping to identify metabolite/gene/microbe interactions Project Summary/Abstract DNA sequencing has spawned the “microbiome revolution” -- thousands of microbes and a dizzying number of microbial interactions that are associated with human health and disease. Unfortunately, most species in the microbiome are known only by a (partial) genome. The limited phenotypic data on newly discovered bacteria reveal species that behave unlike any of our model organisms. While genome-scale modeling plays an important role in understanding the microbiome, the paucity of phenotypic data for most species prevents detailed simulation of the microbial communities that affect our health. This project will develop an automated system for profiling, synthesizing, and modeling microbial communities. The center of our approach is Deep Phenotyping, an automated robotic platform that performs complex growth experiments on demand. Data from Deep Phenotyping will be used to train metabolic and statistical models of the oral pathogens Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans to predict conditions that keep both microbes in a nonpathogenic state. Project Narrative The microbiome revolution has uncovered thousands of species of bacteria with roles in health and disease.

"TEMPORAL DIETARY PATTERNS: DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION AGAINST ADIPOSITY AND METABOLIC BIOMARKERS ABSTRACT There is a growing interest in dietary patterns that capture the overall quality of diet as well as its constituent foods and nutrients. Commonly used dietary patterns are a priori diet score/index based on a set of dietary recommendations for a healthy diet (e.g., Mediterranean diet, Healthy Eating Index) or data-driven dietary patterns (e.g., prudent diet, western diet). Numerous studies have shown that those dietary patterns were related to the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. However, none of these dietary patterns incorporates eating behavior such as when we eat (i.e., eating time) and how often we eat (i.e. eating frequency) during a day. Since the amount of foods and nutrients consumed at one eating occasion influences the food consumption at the subsequent eating occasion and overall intake of the day, eating time and frequency are integral parts of dietary patterns. Furthermore, several lines of evidence consistently suggest that eating time and frequency as well as a meal composition play roles in body weight regulation and metabolic health and also regulate circadian rhythms, all of which may lead to metabolic dysfunctions and ultimately chronic diseases. Given a clear need to expand the dietary patterns framework and close a gap in dietary patterns methodological work, we propose to 1) develop a “temporal” dietary patterns based on temporal distribution of eating time and frequency during a day; and 2) evaluate if the identified temporal dietary patterns are associated with i) overall diet quality and nutrient intakes, ii) adiposity (e.g., BMI, waist circumference), and iii) metabolic biomarkers (e.g., insulin, HOMA-IR, LDL-cholesterol, c-reactive protein). To overcome a limitation that a conventional statistical method cannot capture multidimensional aspects of temporal dietary patterns (e.g., 24-dimensional feature vectors, multivariate dietary intake time-series data), we will use a novel approach combining nutrition and systems science—machine learning method. The Interactive Diet and Activity Tracking in AARP (IDATA) study that repeatedly collected diet, anthropometry, and blood samples from 1,021 men and women, 50-74 years old will be used. During one year, the IDATA study collected 24-hour recalls with clock time for each eating occasion, every other month (total six 24-hour recalls); measured anthropometry three times (baseline and at month 6 and 12); and collected blood twice, 6-month apart. Successful completion of our proposed study will identify temporal dietary patterns that are related to diet quality and metabolic health and validate the utility of temporal dietary patterns as a new tool for future research on diet-health relations and prevention of chronic diseases. NARRATIVE Eating behaviors and its impact on health are complex and multidimensional. The proposed study provides an excellent opportunity to develop new dietary patterns that capture eating behaviors such as when we eat and how often we eat during a day. The findings of the study about healthy eating patterns will also improve dietary recommendations by adding messages on when and how often to eat during a day.",TEMPORAL DIETARY PATTERNS: DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION AGAINST ADIPOSITY AND METABOLIC BIOMARKERS,10053329,R01CA226937,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Anthropometry ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Body Weight ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' Energy Intake ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Circadian Rhythms ', ' Nyctohemeral Rhythm ', ' Twenty-Four Hour Rhythm ', ' circadian process ', ' daily biorhythm ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Fasting ', ' fasted ', ' fasts ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Insulin ', ' Humulin R ', ' Novolin R ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins ', ' LDL Cholesterol ', ' Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol ', ' beta-Lipoprotein Cholesterol ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' nutrition ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Play ', ' Recommendation ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Diet Habits ', ' Dietary Habits ', ' eating habit ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' base ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' improved ', ' Series ', ' Waist-Hip Ratio ', ' waist-to-hip ratio ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Metabolic ', ' tool ', ' Hour ', ' Calories ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Healthy diet ', ' balanced diet ', ' good diet ', ' waist circumference ', ' interest ', ' Nutrient ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' weight control ', ' weight management ', ' Weight maintenance regimen ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Mediterranean Diet ', ' Dietary intake ', ' BMI ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' Data ', ' dietary pattern ', ' Dietary Practices ', ' Intake ', ' Macronutrients Nutrition ', ' Macronutrients ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' food consumption ', ' vector ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' nutrient metabolism ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' obesity risk ', ' risk for obesity ', ' risk of obesity ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' prudent diet ', ' western diet ', ' western-style diet ', ' western-type diet ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' doubly-labeled water ', ' dietary guidelines ', ' Metabolic dysfunction ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' dietary ', ' ']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,224806,MO-01
"Protein Knowledge Networks and Semantic Computing for Disease Discovery Protein Knowledge Networks and Semantic Computing for Disease Discovery The growing volume and breadth of information from the scientific literature and biomedical databases pose challenges to the research community to exploit the content for discovery. This MIRA grant application will advance our knowledge mining and semantic computing system to accelerate data-driven discovery for understanding of gene-disease-drug relationships. We have employed natural language processing and machine learning approaches in a generalizable framework for bioentity and relation extraction from large-scale text. Our Protein Ontology supports protein-centric semantic integration of biomedical data for both human understanding and computational reasoning. We have also developed a resource to support functional interpretation and analysis of protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) across modification types and organisms. Building on our computational algorithms, bioinformatics infrastructure and community interactions, we will further develop literature mining tools to support automated information extraction across the bibliome and open linked data models for semantic integration of biomedical data from heterogeneous resources. Our text mining tools will be trained for different use cases using deep learning methods. We will develop RDF (Resource Description Framework) semantic models in an increasingly computable, inferable and explainable knowledge system to assist in hypothesis generation. We will present evidence in the form of textual artifacts and semantic models to ensure unbiased analysis and interpretation of results to promote rigorous and reproducible research. We will develop scientific case studies to drive the system development. Examples include PTM disease variant and enrichment analyses for drug target identification, genotype- phenotype knowledge mining for Alzheimer's Disease understanding, and gene-disease-drug knowledge network construction for COVID-19 drug repurposing. To foster community engagement, we will host workshops and hackathons to address critical fundamental research questions and emerging disease scenarios. We have fully adopted the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles for resource sharing. All data, tools and research results will be broadly disseminated from the project website, accessible programmatically via RESTful API, queryable via SPARQL endpoints, and dockerized for community code reuse. The successful completion of this research will thus support scalable, integrative and collaborative knowledge discovery to accelerate disease understanding and drug target discovery. PROJECT NARRATIVE The accelerated growth of research data of increasing volume and complexity is profoundly transforming biomedical research, allowing scientists to ask new research questions and address emerging disease scenarios.

"Molecular and metabolic signaling in necrotizing enterocolitis The goal of the current R35 proposal is to understand the underlying pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), the leading cause of death from gastrointestinal disease in premature infants, and to develop novel treatments for this devastating disease. The typical patient with NEC is a premature infant who rapidly progresses from mild feeding intolerance to systemic sepsis and then death within 24 hours. NEC disproportionately affects communities of color, and half of all patients will require laparotomy, which reveals patchy intestinal inflammation and necrosis. There is no specific treatment for NEC, which increases the urgency to develop novel therapies for this devastating disease.  The journey which has led me to write this proposal includes over two decades of research into NEC, including the advancement of a unifying theorem to explain NEC development, the discovery of several classes of anti-NEC agents which have been patented, and most recently, the completion as sole Editor-in- Chief of the first textbook devoted to NEC. This track record gives me a unique vantage point in which to identify the most important unanswered questions in the field, and the experience to create a plan to answer them. Prevailing thinking suggests that NEC arises from an exuberant inflammatory response to bacterial colonization in the premature intestine. In mice and human studies, I discovered that the receptor for gram negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide, namely toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), on the intestinal epithelium, is required for NEC development. TLR4 activity is higher in the premature human and mouse intestinal lining compared to the full-term intestine, which reflects TLR4's role in governing gut development. The subsequent activation of TLR4 by colonizing bacteria leads to inflammation and NEC. These observations formed the basis for my discovery of a novel class of anti-TLR4 molecules that prevent and treat NEC in mice, piglet and human tissue ex vivo. In the current proposal, we will now address four critical knowledge gaps in the field of NEC research: 1. What causes NEC and its hallmark patchy intestinal necrosis? To answer this, we will employ ssRNA-seq in mouse and human NEC tissue and human organoids to discover and then modify TLR4- dependent genetic pathways causing NEC; 2. How can we prevent NEC? We will assess the role of diet (breast milk vs. formula) and immunometabolism on the induction of inflammation in the preterm gut and then manipulate diet-induced inflammatory pathways to reduce NEC; 3. Can we predict NEC earlier? We will assess cellular and molecular maternal factors that contribute to NEC, image blood flow in the premature gut non-invasively, and develop machine learning algorithms for prediction; 4. What causes the long term complications of NEC on the lung, brain and gut? We will perform discovery arrays in humanized organoid platforms as well as mouse and piglet NEC models to identify the link between the inflamed gut and end organ injury.

"GENCODE: comprehensive reference genome annotation for human and mouse Project Summary The GENCODE consortium creates foundational reference genome annotation for the human and mouse genomes in which all features are identified and classified with high accuracy based on biological evidence, and then freely released for the benefit of biomedical research and genome interpretation. GENCODE seeks to create annotation that increases the understanding of genome function in both human and mouse by prioritizing human disease genes and respecting the role of mouse as the major mammalian model organism. To effectively annotate genomes, GENCODE has created a suite of tools and draws on deep expertise across its partners across four fundamental components: 1) a comprehensive gene annotation pipeline leveraging manual and computational annotation; 2) a set of computational methods to evaluate and enhance gene annotation; 3) experimental pipelines targeted to expressed sequences less detectable in standard protocols; and 4) a machine learning capacity to improve all facets of the project. GENCODE will maintain a major focus on protein-coding and non-coding loci, including their alternatively spliced isoforms and pseudogenes and will extend expert manual review to small non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) and the annotation of non-polyadenylated transcripts. GENCODE will also expand regulatory annotation to a defined set of gene-associated features to more accurately reflect the interconnections between regulatory regions, including those with transcribed sequences such as ncRNA, and overall transcriptional output. GENCODE will take advantage of the increasing maturity of genomics technology including long-read transcriptome sequencing, functional genomics assays, and graph- based genome representations to identify features such as genes, pseudogenes, exons and splice sites that are incorrect, incomplete or in genome regions simply not present in the current reference assembly. More specifically, in the next four years GENCODE plans to 1) extend its human and mouse gene sets to as near completion as possible given available data and current experimental technology; 2) leverage new, high-quality human genome assemblies and targeted transcriptomic data to expand representation so that more human haplotypes will have high-quality annotation 3) annotate gene-associated regulatory regions including enhancer- promoter connections 4) collaborate with other resources to ensure a consistent representation of genic and regulatory features and reference transcripts for reporting clinical variation; and 5) distribute GENCODE annotations and engage with community annotation efforts to ensure accuracy and consistency. Primary GENCODE data will continue to be available from the Ensembl and UCSC Genome Browsers and the GENCODE web site. We will develop new mechanisms for effective two-way outreach, training and communication with the community with the long-term aim of establishing GENCODE as the standard annotation set for research and clinical genomics applications. Project Narrative The GENCODE project produces reference genome annotation for the human and mouse genomes. The annotation provides a reference from which to conduct clinical and genomics research in the short term; in the long term it informs all research that will contribute fundamental knowledge to benefit public health.",GENCODE: comprehensive reference genome annotation for human and mouse,10186568,U24HG007234,"['Algorithms ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Exons ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Goals ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' Pseudogenes ', ' Public Health ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rest ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Splicing ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Seeds ', ' Plant Embryos ', ' Plant Zygotes ', ' seed ', ' Specificity ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Open Reading Frames ', ' ORFs ', ' Protein Coding Region ', ' Enhancers ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Distal ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Performance ', ' Isoforms ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' UTRs ', ' Untranslated Regions ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' outreach ', ' Reporting ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' functional genomics ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Mouse Protein ', ' Small RNA ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Transcript ', ' Update ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Output ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' Automated Annotation ', ' annotation schema ', ' computational annotation ', ' computer annotation ', ' Population ', ' transcriptomics ', ' mouse genome ', ' human disease ', ' loss of function ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' genome annotation ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' reference genome ', ' reference assembly ', ' genome browser ', ' computational pipelines ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' community engagement ', ' ']",NHGRI,EUROPEAN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY LABORATORY,U24,2021,2973167,
"Niche signals in HSC genesis PROJECT SUMMARY Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) have well established clinical applications in the treatment of heritable and acquired blood disorders. However, their therapeutic potential could be significantly broadened by engineering novel methods to generate HSC de novo from pluripotent stem cells or from directly reprogrammed adult cells. Toward this goal, we have established endothelial cell (EC) niche based culture methods that provide the necessary conditions to support the specification and self-renewal of HSC from embryonic hemogenic precursors, and more recently, from adult ECs using transcription factor (TF)-mediated conversion that bypasses a pluripotent intermediate. We hypothesize that recreating the signals necessary and sufficient to develop a clinically meaningful system for HSC generation in vitro will necessitate a comprehensive, systems approach to deconstruct the niche provided signals required for HSC specification and self-renewal. Thus, the overall goal of this grant is to leverage unique expertise of the collaborating laboratories to elucidate the signaling interactions regulating HSC specification and self-renewal from embryonic hemogenic precursors or TF-reprogrammed adult EC in the context of the EC niche. Our approach consists of three overlapping aims. The first aim will identify EC niche-provided signals necessary for embryonic HSC specification and self-renewal. The second aim will identify the unique HSC programs induced by these signals that regulate the transition from embryonic hemogenic precursor to bone fide repopulating HSC. The third will identify comparable programs that regulate the transition from adult EC to HSC during TF-mediated reprogramming in the EC niche. Key to these studies will be innovative functional assays, transcriptional profiling methods, and computational approaches that will enable us to resolve cellular complexity of niche cells and their interactions with developing embryonic or reprogrammed HSC at the single cell level. The role of identified signal factors in stage-specific support of HSC specification will be validated and further refined in vitro by gain and loss of function studies in the context of niche EC. Furthermore, to extend these studies to stromal cell-free systems as a step toward clinical translation, we will also test the contribution of identified signal factors in HSC specification and self-renewal in the context of stage-specific modulation of Notch activation using engineered Notch agonists. To achieve the goals of this proposal, we have developed a multidisciplinary collaboration involving unique expertise in each of our laboratories, including basic HSC and EC niche cell biology, direct TF based cellular conversion, clinical HSC transplantation, genome wide assessment of rare stem cell populations at single cell resolution, and innovative computational approaches to deconstruct core signal pathways regulating developmental transitions. Altogether, we expect the proposed studies will ultimately guide the design of novel strategies for deriving and expanding HSC in vitro for therapeutic applications. NARRATIVE Hematopoietic stem cells are currently used in the treatment and cure of a variety of blood disorders. Methods to generate new or greater numbers of hematopoietic stem cells in the laboratory could expand the availability and therapeutic applications of these valuable cells, but currently such methods are lacking. The goal of this proposal is to use lessons from endothelial cells, which provide critical signals to support hematopoietic stem cells, to engineer novel systems for the development and expansion of hematopoietic stem cells in culture. !",Niche signals in HSC genesis,10224676,RC2DK114777,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Aorta ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' blastomere structure ', ' Blastocytes ', ' Embryonic Cell ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' bone ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' cell culture ', ' Cell-Free System ', ' Cellfree System ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Engineering ', ' Goals ', ' Gonadal structure ', ' gonad ', ' gonads ', ' Grant ', ' Hematological Disease ', ' Blood Diseases ', ' Hematologic Diseases ', ' Hematological Disorder ', ' blood disorder ', ' Hematopoietic stem cells ', ' Blood Precursor Cell ', ' Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells ', ' blood stem cell ', ' hematopoietic progenitor ', ' hematopoietic stem progenitor cell ', ' hemopoietic progenitor ', ' hemopoietic stem cell ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' indexing ', ' Laboratories ', ' Mesonephric structure ', ' Mesonephros ', ' Wolffian Body ', ' Methods ', ' Physiological Processes ', ' Organism-Level Process ', ' Organismal Process ', ' Physiologic Processes ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Generations ', ' notch protein ', ' notch ', ' notch receptors ', ' Mediating ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Stromal Cells ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Endothelial Cells ', ' insight ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation ', ' HSC transplantation ', ' Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant ', ' Agonist ', ' Coculture Techniques ', ' Co-culture ', ' Cocultivation ', ' Coculture ', ' Therapeutic ', ' programs ', ' cell biology ', ' Cellular biology ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' ES cell ', ' stem cell of embryonic origin ', ' embryonic stem cell ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' novel ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' Bypass ', ' Gene Expression Monitoring ', ' Gene Expression Pattern Analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analyses ', ' Transcript Expression Analysis ', ' gene expression analysis ', ' gene expression assay ', ' transcriptional profiling ', ' Gene Expression Profiling ', ' Pluripotent Stem Cells ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Address ', ' Molecular Analysis ', ' Resolution ', ' Stem Cell Development ', ' progenitor cell development ', ' in vivo ', ' Signaling Molecule ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Heritability ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' loss of function ', ' self-renewal ', ' self-renew ', ' stem ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' stem cell population ', ' Systems Development ', ' clinical translation ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' hematopoietic stem cell expansion ', ' HSC expansion ', ' blood stem cell expansion ', ' hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal ', ' HSC regeneration ', ' HSC self-renewal ', ' hematopoietic stem cell regeneration ', ' Hematopoietic Stem Cell Specification ', ' HSC Specification ', ' ']",NIDDK,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,RC2,2021,650976,WA-07
"Determining the scope of prenylatable protein sequences PROJECT SUMMARY This study investigates the specificity of farnesyl transferase (FTase) that isoprenylates CaaX proteins. Studies probing the in vivo activity of the FTase have historically used reporters (e.g. Ras GTPases) that undergo complex multi-step post-translational modification (PTM), involving initial farnesylation followed by CaaX proteolysis and carboxyl methylation. This study takes advantage of Hsp40 Ydj1, a farnesylation-only reporter for which we have developed a range of methods to monitor its PTM status. Its use reveals that farnesylation is not necessarily coupled to subsequent PTMs as has been generally accepted for CaaX proteins, and that FTase specificity is significantly more promiscuous than anticipated. These findings challenge the conventional paradigm for how farnesylated proteins are modified and which proteins are targeted by FTase. We will extend our studies to fully resolve the specificity of FTase using a combination of genetic, biochemical, bioinformatic, and biophysical studies. We bring to bear on our investigations an exceptionally strong set of preliminary findings, the complementary expertise of several research groups, and a comprehensive molecular toolbox for the study of farnesylated proteins and other enzymes associated with this post-translational modification pathway. PROJECT NARRATIVE Farnesylated proteins are intimately involved in disease. This project investigates the target specificity of the farnesyl transferase that mediates protein farnesylation.

My title reflects the varied roles I play in the Ideker Lab, both scientifically and administratively, as I also serve as the Assistant Director of the Cancer Cell Map Initiative (CCMI) and the San Diego Center for Systems Biology (SDCSB). I am involved in a wide range of research projects, both within the Ideker Lab and across the various Centers. Central though to many of these efforts is the role I play supervising a number of projects using the CRISPR/Cas9­based approach to map genetic interactions in cancer cells. These functional maps can be used to identify protein complexes and pathways in cancer cells and to reveal genetic dependencies that might be therapeutically tractable. These studies will also provide us with the necessary training data to build “visible” AIs, machine learning models that not only make accurate predictions but also provide mechanistic insights.

"Center for Modeling Complex Interactions Biomedical problems are innately complex, and their solutions require input from many fields. Many centers focus on a single disease or organ system. By contrast, the Center for Modeling Complex Interactions focuses on an approach that can address many biomedical problems: team-based, interdisciplinary research centered around modeling. Our goal is to support and facilitate biomedical discovery by integrating modeling into interdisciplinary research. Modeling improves research at all stages—hypothesis formulation, experimental design, analysis, and interpretation. It provides a unifying language by which exchange of ideas can highlight commonalities and uncover unforeseen connections between problems. Formalization of ideas into this unifying language also improves rigor and reproducibility. We define modeling broadly to include everything from deterministic and stochastic mathematical approaches, to physical and computational models of three- dimensional objects, to agent-based and machine learning approaches where exact solutions are not possible. We seek to support modelers by increasing their numbers, and by giving them opportunities to play on interdisciplinary teams. We seek to support empiricists by giving them access to relevant modeling expertise, and by creating a community and a culture to facilitate interdisciplinary research. In Phase I, the Center for Modeling Complex Interactions created the intellectual, cultural, and physical environment to promote team- based, interdisciplinary research. In Phase II, we will build on that foundation by maintaining a strong interdisciplinary culture to foster collaboration among people who might otherwise never connect, and by adding additional faculty to expand our modeling expertise. We have four Aims: 1) Support faculty to carry out model-based, interdisciplinary biomedical research and increase their competitiveness for external funding. Research in the Center is carried out in the context of Working Groups—zero-barrier, interdisciplinary, goal- focused teams that meet regularly to get work done. Supported research includes three Research Projects, Pilot Projects, Modeling Access Grants, and ad hoc teams. Our comprehensive plan for proposal preparation improves grantsmanship, and our staff assists with submission and grant management. 2) Increase University of Idaho’s faculty participation in biomedical research. We will add six new faculty as a commitment to this Phase II COBRE and attract broader participation from across the University. 3) Extend the reach of the Modeling Core into new areas of modeling to capitalize on emerging opportunities. The Modeling Core accelerates interdisciplinary research by placing Core Fellows at the hub of the research community. We have added new Core Initiatives in machine learning and geospatial modeling to stimulate research in these areas with high potential for future growth. 4) Establish a path to long-term sustainability under the umbrella of the Institute for Modeling Collaboration & Innovation. The major hurdle for sustainability is to maintain a robust Modeling Core. We have developed a business plan that calls for us to diversify our funding sources to include institutional, state, and private support to supplement federal grants. Human health is determined by interactions of complex biological systems at multiple scales, from the ecological to the biophysical; these are layered with spatial and temporal variation. To decipher these systems requires predictive modeling, coupled with strong empirical work, to be guided by and to feed the models.

"Devaluing Energy-Dense Foods for Cancer Control: Translational Neuroscience 7. Abstract Obesity and intake of certain foods increases cancer risk, but the most common treatment (behavioral weight loss programs) rarely produces lasting weight loss and eating behavior change, apparently because caloric restriction increases the reward value of food and prompts energy-sparing adaptations. Interventions that reduce the implicit valuation of cancer-risk foods (e.g., red meats, refined sugar) may be more effective. Emerging data suggest that behavioral response training and cognitive reappraisal training reduce valuation of such foods, which leads to decrease intake of these foods and weight loss. Internalized incentive value is reflected in a ventromedial prefrontal/orbitofrontal cortex valuation system (“vmPFC”), which encodes the implicit reward value of food and is central to a reinforcement cycle that perpetuates unhealthy eating. Thus, the vmPFC valuation system is a promising target for intervention because changes to the system might disrupt the unhealthy reinforcement cycle. Interestingly, various interventions influence the vmPFC through distinct pathways. Behavioral training alters motor input to valuation regions, whereas cognitive training relies on lateral prefrontal “top-down” regions. The proposed translational neuroscience experiment will compare the efficacy with which two novel treatments cause lasting change in food valuation, and whether a composite of theory-based baseline individual differences in relevant processes (such as response tendencies and cognitive styles) moderate treatment effects. We will randomize 300 overweight/obese adults who are at risk for eating- and obesity-related cancers to behavioral response training toward healthy foods and away from cancer-risk foods, a cognitive reappraisal intervention focused on cancer-risk foods, or non–food inhibitory control training. Aim 1 compares the efficacy and mechanisms of action of these two interventions to reduce valuation of cancer-risk foods relative to the active control condition, using neural, behavioral, self-report, and physiological measures of the process and outcomes. Aim 2 is to establish the temporal pattern and durability of the effects across time ; food intake and habits , body fat, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio will be measured pre, post, and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. Aim 3 uses machine learning to build and validate a low-cost, easy-to-administer composite that predicts whether and for how long an individual is likely to respond to intervention, and to which treatment. We hypothesize that self-report measures specifically related to valuation (e.g., willingness-to-pay) and to intervention-specific pathways to valuation (e.g., behavioral response tendencies, cognitive style) will predict differential response. Discovering these individual differences will provide a practical, low-cost tool to help interventionists “match” a given person to an effective treatment for that person . This project is very innovative because no study has directly compared the distinct and common effects of these treatments on valuation, used brain imaging to study the mechanism of effects, tested whether these interventions produce a lasting change in food valuation and body fat, or built and validated a composite that moderates response . 8. Project Narrative Excessive eating of energy-dense and obesity are risk factors for a range of cancers.

"Machine learning-enabled Comparative Transcriptomic Profiling to Validate NanoScript-induced Inner Ear Hair Cells PROJECT SUMMARY  Hearing loss during early childhood significantly affects learning and acquisition of social skills, while hearing loss in adults can often result in social isolation and the inability to perform many routine social functions. A leading cause of sensorineural hearing loss is the loss of sensory hair cells of the inner ear. A lifetime exposure to aminoglycoside and loud sounds will result in an estimated 15% of adult Americans (~36 million) having some form of hearing loss. A promising approach to mitigate hearing loss and deafness is a cell replacement therapy by transdifferentiating supporting cells into hair cells. Unfortunately, current approaches for transdifferentiation rely on viral delivery may be unsafe and impractical for clinical translation. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop alternative platforms for regulating gene expression and inducing transdifferentiation in an efficient, non- viral manner that is suitable for restoration of hearing.  To this end, our long-term goal is to develop NanoScript, an innovative, tunable nanoparticle-based artificial transcription factor platform capable of effectively regulating gene expression in a non-viral manner. Using NanoScript, we will transdifferentiate supporting cells into functional hair cells. NanoScript consists of a nanoparticle functionalized with specific small molecules and peptides that are designed to mimic the individual domains of natural transcription factor (TF) proteins. TFs are endogenous, multi-domain proteins that orchestrate many cellular functions, including differentiation. Since NanoScript is a functional replica of TF proteins, it can replace virally-delivered TFs for regenerative medicine-based applications. The overall objective of this proposal is to design three NanoScripts that mimic three TFs essential for hair cell differentiation (Gfi1, Pou4f3, and Atoh1; GPA). We will test whether GPA-NanoScript binds to the same DNA sequence and activate gene expression in vitro. Next, we will determine if the addition of epigenetic modulators to GPA-NanoScript will bind to the same targets as the TF proteins, locally alter the chromatin structure and enhance gene expression. Finally, we will use cochlear explants to determine whether GPA-NanoScript promotes transdifferentiation of supporting cells into hair cells by single-cell transcriptome analysis. Generation of nascent hair cells using an ex vivo model will serve as a springboard to test NanoScript technology for regenerative medicine. It will also establish NanoScript as an effective and non-viral tool for researchers to generate functional cells via direct reprogramming.

To address the challenges associated with studying a complex inner hair cells (IHCs) environment with only a limited number of observations, such as induced measurement bias and irreproducibility of experimental results, we propose to develop a conditional adversarial network to recapitulate the transcriptomes of inner and outer hair cells to supplement downstream analysis. Then, we will validate our AI/ML experiments by comparing the transcriptomes of differentiated iMOP cells to the generated transcriptomes by examining the Pearson correlation between marker genes and sequencing experiments.",Machine learning-enabled Comparative Transcriptomic Profiling to Validate NanoScript-induced Inner Ear Hair Cells,10412274,R01DC016612,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Aminoglycosides ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Award ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' bone ', ' Cartilage ', ' Cartilaginous Tissue ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cochlea ', ' Cochlear Organ ', ' deafness ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Hair Cells ', ' Corti Cell ', ' ear hair cell ', ' Inner Hair Cells ', ' Sensorineural Hearing Loss ', ' Sensorineural Deafness ', ' Sensory Hearing Loss ', ' sensorineural hearing impairment ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Labyrinth ', ' Internal Ear ', ' inner ear ', ' Learning ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Peptides ', ' Phenotype ', ' Proteins ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Social isolation ', ' sound ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Generations ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Tertiary Protein Structure ', ' Peptide Domain ', ' Protein Domains ', ' base ', ' Loudness ', ' Biological ', ' Outer Hair Cells ', ' Ensure ', ' Sensory Hair ', ' Individual ', ' Data Files ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' postnatal ', ' Source ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Osseous Labyrinth ', ' bony labyrinth ', ' labyrinthine membrane ', ' membranous labyrinth ', ' sensory nerve ', ' afferent nerve ', ' Viral ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' early childhood ', ' interpersonal competence ', ' interpersonal competency ', ' social competence ', ' social competency ', ' social skills ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Biological Mimetics ', ' Biomimetics ', ' Differential Display ', ' differential display technique ', ' mRNA Differential Displays ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Regenerative Medicine ', ' small molecule ', ' Hearing Loss ', ' Hypoacuses ', ' Hypoacusis ', ' dysfunctional hearing ', ' hearing defect ', ' hearing deficit ', ' hearing difficulty ', ' hearing disability ', ' hearing dysfunction ', ' hearing impairment ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Supporting Cell ', ' Chromatin Structure ', ' Endogenous Factors ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' stem cell differentiation ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' Social Functioning ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' nanoparticle ', ' nano particle ', ' nano-sized particle ', ' nanosized particle ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' transcriptomics ', ' comparative ', ' transdifferentiation ', ' overexpression ', ' overexpress ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' differential expression ', ' differentially expressed ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' supplemental instruction ', ' supplemental learning ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' GFI1 gene ', ' GFI-1 ', ' GFI1 ', ' GFI1A ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' clinical translation ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' hearing restoration ', ' restore hearing ', ' in silico ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' cell replacement therapy ', ' nerve damage ', ' ']",NIDCD,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2021,311115,NJ-06
"A System for Xerostomia Risk Classification after Head & Neck Cancer Radiotherapy Project Summary/Abstract  Head and neck cancer (HNC) patients survive years after oncologic therapy due to increased efficacy of therapy, increased incidences of human papilloma virus related HNC, and decreased numbers of smoking and tobacco related tumors. However, the majority of patients are plagued with long lasting or permanent dry mouth (xerostomia), whose severity, rate of development and resolution after treatment vary largely between survivors. However, current prediction models for dry mouth have intrinsic issues which so far have prevented their practical use in clinical care, including missing or incomplete data, co- occurence of multiple symptoms, variability across populations and across time, and, in the case of HNC and other spatially-dependent cancers, further symptom dependency on the anatomical location of dose within to organs at risk, namely, salivary glands.  We propose to develop validated, patient-specific models to interpret radiation dose to salivary glands in order to inform individual treatment and care decisions for patients. Our data science approach circumvents limitations in the state of the art by accounting for more complex dose-reponse models of dry mouth, by calibrating for inter-patient variability, and by predicting symptom development and computing clinical action signals for a new patient based on cohorts of similar patients.  The proposed supplement application extends the methodological approach of the parent award by incorporating validation data from an alternative facility, item assessment, and user experience testing of the resultant software model user interface, undertaken within a career development plan designed to enhance and accelerate the capacity of the applicant, who is from a background underrepresented in biomedical sciences, to transition to mentored and independent investigator status, thus enhancing cancer research workforce diversity under this program.

"Elucidating the role of the gut metagenome in hypertension. Project Summary Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death world-wide. The primary modifiable risk factor for CVD is hypertension (HTN), which is exacerbated by high sodium intake. One third of Americans are hypertensive, of which half exhibit salt-sensitive HTN. Additionally, 12% of HTN patients do not respond to treatment using standard medications. Taken together, these statistics highlight the critical need to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the development of HTN for the design of alternative treatment options. The gut microbiome has been implicated in many diseases including HTN. This project is designed to identify HTN- exacerbating or protective bacteria and their associated metabolic genes to inform the design of microbiome-based therapeutics for the treatment of HTN. Our preliminary results demonstrate that severe HTN induced by salt consumption correlates with shifts in the gut microbial community of Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) rats. Therefore, we tested the potential for the gut microbiota to affect HTN by performing a fecal material transfer (FMT) from hypertensive Dahl SS into HTN-resistant rats. We demonstrated that the microbiome was sufficient to exacerbate HTN in recipients and corresponded with statistically significant shifts in the gut microbiome. These results lead us to hypothesize that the gut microbiota directly influences HTN. Aim 1 will evaluate the role of bacterial supplementation during onset of HTN in the Dahl SS rat model. Predetermined strains identified from our preliminary experiments will be grown in vitro and transferred into SS Dahl rats and the effect on blood pressure and kidney damage will be evaluated. Potential mechanisms through which the bacteria influence the severity of HTN will be explored by measuring metabolite production, evaluating gut barrier function, and identifying shifts in the gut microbiome. Aim 2 will utilize machine learning to identify specific gut bacteria and metabolic genes that serve as signatures for the severity of HTN. Experiments in this aim will exploit shotgun metagenomic sequencing and computational approaches to identify specific bacteria and metabolic genes associated with HTN. Their use as predictive biomarkers for HTN will be validated by PCR-based analysis. This work will take place in the laboratory of Dr. John Kirby in the Department of Microbiology & Immunology (M&I) at the Medical College of Wisconsin, a highly collaborative and stimulating environment that is well equipped to perform the proposed aims. The Department of M&I offers a state-of-the-art educational program and various opportunities to explore alternative career pathways. We have designed a complementary training plan for my scientific and professional growth that will position me to reach my goal of becoming an independent biomedical scientist. In all, this project is critical for my advancement as a Latina woman in biomedical research, the field of HTN research, and the generation of microbiome-based therapeutics for CVD. Project Narrative Hypertension (HTN) is the primary risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is the leading cause of death world-wide. While the gut microbiome has been implicated in many diseases, a mechanism by which the microbiota influence HTN remain unknown. This project is designed to identify specific bacteria, metabolic genes, and potential mechanisms by which the microbiota influence HTN.

"Nathan Shock Center for Excellence in Basic Biology of Aging OVERALL—PROJECT SUMMARY Healthspan is a complex trait, influenced by many interacting polymorphic alleles and environmental factors that may accelerate or delay aging, reduce or increase disease risk, and/or promote extended lifespan. Thus, assessing the role of genetic variation in aging requires an experimental strategy capable of modeling the genetic and biological complexity of human populations while allowing for efficient identification and validation of candidate genes. With this proposal, the JAX NSC seeks support to further develop and disseminate the next generation of genetic, phenotyping, and information resources necessary to enable a systems-wide approach to understanding healthy aging. Over the past 15 years, The JAX NSC has transformed aging research both at JAX and across the geroscience community, providing central resources to support investigators that have resulted in 26 peer-reviewed publications in the last funding period. The Center has developed nascent regional and national resources for aging research, including aging mouse resources and tissues that support our numerous collaborations and external researchers. All JAX NSC data and tools are publicly disseminated on the Mouse Phenome Database and the JAX NSC website, thus ensuring that the resources generated and expertise acquired through the Center is readily available to the aging research community. In this renewal, we will advance towards our goal by providing unique resources, tools, and support to geroscience investigators while leveraging JAX's unparalleled expertise in the large-scale identification and functional validation of complex polygenic traits in mice. We will do this by providing effective Center administration and enhancing the utility of JAX NSC resources throughout the aging community (Aim 1); expanding the research focus on aging, healthspan and age-related diseases through a robust Research Development Core (Aim 2); increasing the diversity of mouse resources available for aging research, including a new study to, for the first time, investigate the effect of genetic variation on cellular senescence and treatment with senolytic drugs (Aim 3); strengthening the data and computational and support available to the aging community (Aim 4); expanding the use of machine learning technologies in interpretation of aging pathologies (Aim 5). The Center will be led by a highly experienced team of Principal Investigators and Core Leaders who, with oversight from an External Advisory Board, will provide effective management to facilitate the goals and objectives of the Center. The Center will leverage unparalleled institutional resources, facilities and expertise of The Jackson Laboratory, a globally renowned institution for mouse genetics research, to enhance its goals and the utility of the resources it generates for the aging research community. OVERALL—PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Human aging is influenced by genetic factors, whereby differences in longevity as well as changes in health and disease risk with time are linked to variation in individuals' genetic codes. The Jackson Laboratory Nathan Shock Center will develop resources to encourage the use of a wider range of mouse models in aging research. Resources—including aged mouse models that mirror human genetic variation, metabolic and microbiome data, and methods to reveal genetic factors tied to human aging—will be available to the scientific community, accelerating research to understand and ultimately prolong healthy human aging.",Nathan Shock Center for Excellence in Basic Biology of Aging,10261436,P30AG038070,"['Aging ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Animals ', ' Cell Aging ', ' Cell Senescence ', ' Cellular Aging ', ' Cellular Senescence ', ' Replicative Senescence ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Genes ', ' Genetic Code ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heart ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Joints ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leadership ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Maps ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Genetic Models ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Pathology ', ' Peer Review ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Quality Control ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Shock ', ' Circulatory Collapse ', ' circulatory shock ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' animal tissue ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Genetic Research ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Polygenic Characters ', ' Polygenic Inheritances ', ' Polygenic Traits ', ' Institution ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Biology of Aging ', ' Data ', ' Inbred Strain ', ' information resource ', ' knowledge resource ', ' knowledge resources ', ' Information Resources ', ' The Jackson Laboratory ', ' Validation ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' microbiome ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' computer aided ', ' next generation ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' user-friendly ', ' open source ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' senescence ', ' senescent ', ' healthy aging ', ' public health relevance ', ' phenome ', ' candidate validation ', ' Geroscience ', ' phenotypic data ', ' healthspan ', ' health-span ', ' data tools ', ' data dissemination ', ' mouse genetics ', ' behavioral phenotyping ', ' behavior phenotype ', ' ']",NIA,JACKSON LABORATORY,P30,2021,1069526,ME-02
"Identifying drug synergistic with cancer immunotherapy PROJECT SUMMARY Avinash D Sahu, Ph.D., is a computational biologist whose overarching career goal is to solve longstanding problems in cancer immunology and translational precision oncology using artificial intelligence (AI) and to devise new therapeutic strategies for late-stage cancer patients. Entitled Identifying drug synergistic with cancer immunotherapy, the proposed research combines cutting-edge AI technology with Immuno-oncology (IO) to produce a systematic approach to identifying drugs that synergize with immunotherapy, and prioritize them for clinical trials for advanced melanoma, bladder, kidney, and lung cancer. Career development plan: Dr. Sahu is a recipient of the Michelson Prize, and his research mission is to initiate precision immuno-oncology by moving patients away from palliative chemotherapy to more personalized IO treatments. His previous training in AI, statistics, method development, cancer, and translation biology have prepared him to conduct the proposed research. Dr. Sahu has outlined specific training activities to expand his skill set in four areas: 1) cancer immunology, 2) AI, 3) translation research and 4) new immunological assays. This skill set will be necessary to gain research independence. Mentors/Environment: Dr. Sahu mentoring and the advisory team assembles world-leading experts in computational biology, translation and clinical research, AI, statistics, and immunology. Also, Dr. Sahu has developed academic collaborations and industry partners to provide him experimental support for the proposal. Leveraging the state-of-art software and google-cloud infrastructure provided by Cancer Immune Data Commons (CIDC); computational resources from DFCI, Harvard, and Broad Institute; as well as unique access to largest immunotherapy patient data from collaborators, Dr. Sahu is uniquely placed to identify most promising IO drug combinations. Research: There is a lack of a principled approach to identify promising IO drug combinations that has often led to arbitrarily designed IO clinical trials without a sound biological basis. The proposal formulates the first in silico predictor to estimate drug’s immunomodulatory effect and potential to synergize with immunotherapies. Aim 1 builds a novel deep learning predictor —DeepImmune— to predict immunotherapy response from transcriptomes. Aim 2 estimates the immunomodulatory effects of drugs from for its drug-induced transcriptomic changes using DeepImmune. Aim 3 prioritize top predicted immunomodulatory drugs and validate their effect in pre-clinical models. Outcomes/Impact: The successful completion of the proposal will result in a robust predictor to rationally combine cancer therapies with immunotherapy and set the basis for a clinical trial to test the most promising combination therapy. The career development award and mentored research will enable Dr. Sahu to become a leader in the new field of research at the intersection of precision immuno-oncology and AI. PROJECT NARRATIVE Combining immunotherapies with other cancer drugs has emerged as a new hope for late-stage cancer patients, however, the lack of a principled approach to identify such effective combinations often led to poorly designed clinical trials. The proposed research engages state-of-art Artificial Intelligence techniques with drug-induced transcriptomic changes to identify drugs that synergize with immunotherapies and prioritize them for clinical trials. Its application, as well as the career development pursued by the investigator, will rationalize clinical trials, identify new treatments for advanced cancers, and advance precision

"UW 4-Dimensional Genomic Organization of Mammalian Embryogenesis Center Project Summary / Abstract A major shortcoming of most efforts to understand the 4D nucleome is that they have mainly focused on in vitro cell lines, rather than on dynamic, in vivo systems. Arguably, the most important in vivo system, which also happens to be the most dynamic, is development itself, wherein the nucleome both shapes and is shaped by the initial emergence of the myriad mammalian cell types. While these in vivo dynamics are presently poorly documented and understood, recently emerged technologies offer a path forward. Here we propose to establish the University of Washington 4-Dimensional Genomic Nuclear Organization of Mammalian Embryogenesis Center (UW 4D GENOME Center), which will address these massive gaps in our understanding by generating systematic datasets on nuclear morphology and associated molecular measurements in mammalian tissues and cell types. These datasets will be generated in the context of the leading model organism for mammalian development, the mouse. Our approach focuses on following nuclear structure, chromatin and gene expression changes at a “whole organism” scale, using a combination of scalable single cell profiling and “visual cell sorting” (VCS) methods, all well-established and mostly developed in our own labs. Our goal is to generate a high- resolution 4DN atlas of mouse embryogenesis for the community. The different types of data will be integrated, including cross-species imputation to integrate with human data, as well as models and navigable maps applied to pathways relevant to mammalian development. Project Narrative The UW 4D Genome Organization of Mammalian Embryogenesis Center (UW 4D GENOME) aims to elucidate chromatin dynamics during the early stages of mammalian development. Accordingly, the proposed center will carry out systematic generation of sequencing and imaging data during mouse embryogenesis, summarizing and visualizing the resulting data using machine learning models. These approaches will also be applied to investigate nuclear architecture in mouse models with mutations in genes relevant to nuclear structure, which will help advance our understanding of diseases such as laminopathy and cancer.",UW 4-Dimensional Genomic Organization of Mammalian Embryogenesis Center,10265565,UM1HG011586,"['Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Antibodies ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Atlases ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cell Nucleolus ', ' Plasmosome ', ' nucleolus ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell Separation ', ' Cell Isolation ', ' Cell Segregation ', ' Cell Separation Technology ', ' cell sorting ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Heterochromatin ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybrids ', ' In Vitro ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Phenotype ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Stains ', ' Staining method ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' X Inactivation ', ' Lyonization ', ' X-Chromosome Inactivation ', ' nucleophosmin ', ' B23 Nuclear Matrix Protein ', ' Nucleolar Phosphoprotein B23 ', ' nucleolar protein B23 ', ' nucleophosmid ', ' protein B23 ', ' Generations ', ' lamin B receptor ', ' lamin B p58 receptor ', ' p58 protein ', ' Lamin Type A ', ' Lamin A ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Series ', ' Visual ', ' Measurement ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Hour ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Nuclear ', ' Gene Alteration ', ' Gene Mutation ', ' human data ', ' mutant ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' novel ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Mammalian Cell ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' molecular profile ', ' molecular signature ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Chromatin Structure ', ' Nuclear Structure ', ' Whole Organism ', ' C57BL/6 Mouse ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' imprint ', ' Four-dimensional ', ' 4-dimensional ', ' human disease ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' knowledge translation ', ' molecular phenotype ', ' mouse development ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' ATAC-seq ', ' ATACseq ', ' web portal ', ' internet portal ', ' on-line portal ', ' online portal ', ' web-based portal ', ' Visualization ', ' Hi-C ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,UM1,2021,2031051,WA-07
"Multi-Resolution Docking Methods for Electron Microscopy Summary In the past decade, we have witnessed a revolutionary progress in camera technology and the attainable resolution of macromolecular assemblies via cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and in the development of computational algorithms that relate the resulting 3D maps to atomic resolution structures. Whereas single- particle cryo-EM today is capable of directly solving atomic structures of biomolecular assemblies in isolation, electron tomography (ET) in unstained frozen-hydrated samples is widely used to capture the 3D organization of supramolecular complexes in their native (organelle, cell, or tissue) environments. We have identified three inter-related research areas where our computational modeling experience (historically rooted in pre-revolution multi-scale approaches) offers the biggest value to today's post-revolution EM community: (1) medium resolution cryo-EM modeling, (2) the segmentation and denoising of cryo-ET data, and (3) the validation of atomic models and their corresponding maps. The first aim is an extension of promising new ideas in flexible fitting as well as secondary structure prediction for medium resolution maps, which have been our key research areas in the past. medium resolution (5-10Å) maps are still widely used in EM and can be of significant biological importance. This is particularly true in the case of cryo-ET maps, which are harder to read than single particle cryo-EM maps because they often exhibit considerable noise, anisotropic resolution, and anisotropic density variations due to the low dose requirements and the missing wedge in the Fourier space. In the case of tightly packed or crowded macromolecular structures, the fusion of nearby biomolecular densities prevents an automated segmentation of geometric shapes, requiring a labor-intensive manual tracing by human experts. We are currently developing novel computational approaches to provide a more objective strategy for missing wedge correction in homogeneous specimen areas of tomograms. Our hybrid approach combines deconvolution and denoising with template matching in a unified mathematical framework that allows modeling constraints to be imposed in a least-squares optimization process. Our approach can also be extended to the flexible refinement of atomic structures using our damped dynamics flexible fitting approach by tuning the internal point-spread functions to the missing wedge of the ET data. To support these aims, we will quantitatively measure the fitness of an atomic model in local density regions and characterize the fitness of maps with reliable reference structures. The collaborative efforts supported by this grant will include the refinement of cytoskeletal filaments, molecular motors, bacterial chemoreceptor arrays, and hair cell stereocilia. The algorithmic and methodological developments will be distributed freely through the established Internet-based mechanisms used by the Situs and Sculptor packages and as plugins for the popular UCSF Chimera graphics program. Project Narrative This project will help biological electron microscopists bridge a broad range of resolution levels, from the atomic to the living organism. Macromolecular assemblies are the basic functional units of biological cells; they furnish targets for drug design because deficiencies in macromolecular assembly architecture are frequently linked to health problems.

This Center has over the past 25 years provided key resources in support of investigators who study the biology of aging. This application continues a theme that emphasizes outreach and service to the broadest community of investigators in the gerosciences. Of proximal relevance is the characterization of aging-related phenotypes of longevity and healthspan. As our Center services must be easily accessible to outside users, our Longevity and Healthspan Core (Core E) focuses on invertebrate assays, many of them novel. Two other Resources Cores focus on the high dimensional assessments that are closely related to aging phenotypes: Protein Phenotypes of Aging (Core C) and Metabolite Phenotypes of Aging (Core D). Sophisticated computational and bioinformatic tools for data analysis and optimal insight are provided by the Artificial Intelligence and Bioinformatics Core F. Each of these four Resource Cores is led by highly respected experts in that field, including Michael MacCoss and Judit Villen (Core C), Daniel Promislow (Core D), Matt Kaeberlein and Maitreya Dunham (Core E) and Su-In Lee (Core F). Each will push the envelope of appropriate technologies, developing new state-of-the art approaches for assessments that are the most applicable to gerontology and making them accessible to the national aging community. The Research Development Core (Core B) will continue to support pilot and junior faculty studies, with a firm focus on outreach of service to the national geroscience constituency. The Administrative and Program Enrichment Core (Core A) supports administrative management, an external advisory panel, courses, and data sharing and dissemination. Core A’s program of seminars and symposia will continue a focus on sponsorship and organization of national courses, meetings and pre-meetings, as well as workshops in the fields allied to our Resource Core Services.

"Genomes in 3D: from maps to mechanisms Project Summary In each of our trillions of cells, genetic information is stored on meter-long chromosomes spatially organized inside micron-scale nuclei. In the past decade, large-scale efforts have built increasingly detailed atlases of transcription, regulatory elements, and genome folding across ever-expanding sets of cell types and tissues. Still, these beautiful maps do not by themselves reveal the sequences or molecular mechanisms acting in these diverse cellular contexts. Drawing on approaches from biophysics, bioinformatics, and machine learning, this project will develop novel computational approaches to determine the DNA sequences and mechanisms underlying 3D genome organization, and how this in turn relates to genomic functions. Drawing on the latest breakthroughs in machine learning, we will model how individual nucleotides contribute to genome folding. We will apply these models to characterize cell-type specific genome folding, develop methods to engineer DNA sequences in silico, and model enhancer-promoter influences. Concurrently, we will build biophysical models to understand deeply conserved mechanisms of genome folding. Using meiotic chromosome folding as a model system, we will develop models to learn new rules governing cohesin dynamics and loop extrusion. To uncover how extrusion interfaces with other mechanisms, we will build models of synaptonemal complex assembly, as well as models of meiotic chromosome organization across species. By honing in on the sequences most crucial for locus-specific genome folding and characterizing the mechanisms driving genome- wide folding, the computational models we develop and the mechanisms we discover will enable new approaches to precision genome engineering. This will include how to re-wire gene-regulatory circuits, not only by targeting enhancers and promoters, but also by modulating their cell-type specific communication. At the same time, the aims described here will bridge fundamental insights into 3D chromosome organization with clinical genomics, and greatly improve the interpretability of non-coding DNA variants. Project Narrative Non-coding DNA sequences play crucial roles in gene regulation and the physical organization of the genome, with roles in development and consequences for disease. Using novel biophysical modeling and machine- learning approaches, this project will connect fundamental insights into 3D genome organization with the functional consequences of its disruption.

"Integrating Stochasticity into Biomolecular Mechanisms: A New Direction for Biomolecular Modeling Integrating Stochasticity into Biomolecular Mechanisms: A New Direction for  Biomolecular Modeling Abstract It is increasingly apparent that kinetic selection plays an important role in biology. However, we are just beginning to have the tools necessary to quantify, characterize and understand it. For biomolecular processes involving multiple rare-event transitions, the canonical assumption is that mechanisms proceed following a consistent order of transitions (following a single-pathway). However, increasing evidence from single molecule experiments and biophysical measurements suggests that multiple pathways are not only possible, but essential. The goal of the proposed research is to develop an experimentally-directed stochastic simulation framework for mapping out mechanistic heterogeneity. As applications, I will focus, first, on secondary active transport in the ClC Cl-/H+ antiporter and ATP hydrolysis driven translocation in several AAA+ ATPases, two processes involving chemical reactions and thus requiring multiscale methods that bridge the quantum to classical realms. The proposed approach to multiscale kinetic modeling is focused on multistep biomolecular transformations, which makes it unique to many other domains of established kinetic modeling. Thus, new methods will be developed and best practices from other domains will be adapted. It combines a bottom-up calculation of rate coefficients for kinetically relevant transitions from multiscale simulations, with a top-down parameter refinement based on experimental data. Innovation is proposed to refine the kinetic solution space with Bayesian parameter estimation, global sensitivity analysis, uncertainty quantification, reaction path analysis and machine learning methods. These methods will be used to better characterize the Cl-/H+ exchange mechanism in the ClC-ec1 antiporter in collaboration with Merritt Maduke (Stanford). The kinetic landscape for the wildtype system will be studied to address the role of pathway heterogeneity, the origin of the non-integral 2.2:1 Cl-:H+ stoichiometry, and the relevance of the alternating access mechanism. Similar to secondary active transport, ATP-driven processes inherently involve multiple rate-influencing steps (ATP binding, hydrolysis, Pi release, ADP release, and all of the associated conformational changes). A multiscale reactive molecular dynamics method will be developed to describe ATP hydrolysis. Additionally, enhanced free energy sampling will be used to characterize other transitions and multiscale kinetic models will be developed to probe the role of kinetic selectivity and to test the controversial stochastic versus sequential proposed mechanisms in AAA+ ATPases in collaboration with Chris Hill (University of Utah).

"Determinants of inception of inflammation in inflammatory bowel diseases Project Summary Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) affect over 2 million individuals in the United States and are associated with considerable morbidity. Existing treatments achieve remission in fewer than 50% of patients. Further, despite achieving endoscopic remission, up to 30% of patients with CD or UC will relapse over the subsequent three years. Pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to relapse have not been well established. The central premise of our proposal is that despite endoscopic, there exists a local pro-inflammatory microbial milieu and transcriptional profile that favors disease relapse. We hypothesize that current clinical tools do not have sufficient resolution to capture this state. Existing cohorts, by recruiting patients in a heterogeneous state of active inflammation, cannot be used to infer mechanisms of loss of remission and inception of inflammation. A targeted effort that comprehensively and longitudinally profiles a homogeneous cohort of patients in deep remission is essential to define the dynamic relationship between microbial alterations, metabolomic, transcriptional, and proteomic perturbations, and onset of inflammation. Identifying deficient components favoring relapse also allows the development of intervention to replace these deficiencies, thereby extending remission. They will also provide clues and serve as starting points for development of novel therapies. In the first aim, we will recruit 300 patients with IBD in clinical and endoscopic remission and prospectively, systematically follow them for 3 years. We will comprehensively characterize such patients through serial sampling of mucosal and fecal microbiome, serum and fecal metabolome, and proteome in addition to detailed environmental exposure assessment and measurement of drug pharmacokinetics. We will determine the dynamic predictive utility of each of these parameters in defining future relapse from a state of quiescence. In the second aim, we will define the role of pro-inflammatory changes at the cellular level by performing single cell transcriptomic analysis from colonic and ileal biopsies in patients with quiescent CD and UC recruited as above. This will provide important insights into loss of control of inflammation at the tissue level that determines future clinical activity. The final study aim will train and validate a machine-learning predictive model to define the contribution of each additional biologic layer to inception of inflammation and to identify more robust biomarkers of a state of sustained remission. Defining the molecular basis of future relapse in patients in deep remission will provide insights into the ‘pre-disease’ state, allowing for identification of immune pathways of relevance in preventing disease. Defining the fundamental mechanisms through which disease inception occurs from quiescence is critically important to inform key steps in the pathogenesis of these complex diseases, which in turn, will offer opportunities for targeted mechanism-driven interventions to aid durable maintenance of remission and health. The approaches and analyses outlined also have broad applicability to other autoimmune diseases.

"A web-based framework for multi-modal visualization and annotation of neuroanatomical data PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Modern experimental approaches allow researchers to collect a variety of whole-brain data from the same animal via different anatomical labels, including tracers, genetic markers, and fiducial marks from recording electrodes. Unfortunately, viewing and analysis methods have not kept pace with the complexity of these datasets, which can be as large as several terabytes. This limitation makes it time- and resource-intensive to view and manipulate light-microscopy data or to share these datasets with distant laboratories. Currently available software solves some aspects of this problem, but no existing program provides a user-friendly way to visualize, annotate, and compare large neuroanatomical datasets across research sites, with minimal investment of computational resources. We propose to develop a web-based tool, named BrainSharer, to allow researchers to access, visualize, align, share, and semi-automatically annotate brain-wide data within a common framework. The foundation for this tool will be provided by Neuroglancer, a generic web-based volumetric viewer first developed at Google and then adapted for use in electron microscopy laboratories. While some of its current features are useful across applications, existing versions of Neuroglancer are not optimized for light-microscopy data. In particular, they do not realize the potential for sharing, viewing, and editing data across multi-laboratory collaborations, such as U19 projects. To enable BrainSharer to serve data rapidly and to save and restore sessions, we will add a modular distributed database to synchronize metadata across laboratories. In addition, we will tailor BrainSharer for light microscopy by displaying data in formats independent of the imaging modality, adding semiautomatic means to segment cell bodies and processes, adding tools for annotation (with special attention to defining cytological boundaries in three dimensions and tracing projection pathways), and adding ways to incorporate auxiliary data such as electrode tracks. In addition, we will integrate alignment tools into BrainSharer, so that separate datasets can be co-registered, visualized, and annotated in the same framework, along with established and emerging atlases. As test beds for development of BrainSharer, we will use three types of datasets from our U19 projects: whole-brain disynaptic and polysynaptic tracing, activity-based staining with c-fos, and neurovascular data. All software, training datasets, and video tutorials for BrainSharer will be made freely available to the community, hosted on our website, along with a slice histology dataset and an electrophysiology dataset with probes implanted throughout the brain. To orient new users, we will also provide a Jupyter notebook for converting raw, intermediate, and registered light-sheet data, along with detected cells and brain atlases, to precomputed format, so they can be loaded into BrainSharer. When complete, BrainSharer will make it straightforward for researchers to use their laptops to combine and compare large datasets from different anatomical labels for viewing and analysis relative to reference atlases, and to share this information across performance sites, thus increasing the ease of use and interoperability of big data in neuroscience. PROJECT NARRATIVE A critical step in understanding brain function is to determine how specific neurons and regions interact via their connections, many of which project between regions. However, three-dimensional neuroanatomical data currently requires massive computational resources to view, analyze, or share with other researchers.

"ClinTAD: A Tool for Improving Clinical CNV Interpretation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT DNA microarray is a routine clinical pediatric diagnostic test to identify genomic copy number variants (CNVs) that could be causative of autism, developmental delay, and multiple congenital anomalies. This test is also used frequently in the prenatal setting to find genomic causes of fetal anomalies found by ultrasound, or to predict potential phenotypes postnatally. Current clinical guidelines for interpretation of CNVs focus solely on the characteristics of genes contained within the CNV breakpoints. However, recent studies on chromatin architecture, utilizing Hi-C or related techniques, have demonstrated that CNVs can also disrupt the structure of topologically associated domains (TADs). TADs are “neighborhoods” of physical DNA interactions that serve several functions, including the prevention of ectopic gene-enhancer interactions. This TAD disruption can lead to pathogenic alterations in transcription of genes outside the CNV region that are ultimately causative of disease. The central hypothesis of this proposal is by only focusing on genes within the CNV region for clinical interpretation, critical genomic information is being entirely ignored in DNA microarray interpretation, ultimately leading to missed diagnoses for patients. To address this issue, we have recently developed the free-to-use software ClinTAD (www.clintad.com; J Hum Genet (2019)) to assist in the interpretation of CNVs while taking potential TAD disruption into account. To our knowledge, this is the first software of its kind to attempt to integrate TADs into clinical CNV interpretation. While ClinTAD v1.0 is currently available as a decision support tool to assist in clinical practice, it is currently limited both in its ease-of-use as well as its predictive power. Further enhancing the utility of ClinTAD motivates the two Aims of our proposal here: 1) We aim to optimize ClinTAD as both a clinical decision support and research tool by allowing incorporation of TAD boundaries from different datasets, enabling an API for analysis of large case cohorts, adding interpretation tools for Regions of Homozygosity found on SNP array, and allowing for creation of a de-identified database where users can upload cases with suspicion for pathogenicity based on TAD disruption. 2) We aim to improve the predictive power of ClinTAD through machine learning to identify the most predictive features of pathogenicity in a large, publicly available CNV cohorts, as well as by incorporating a recently-described convolutional neural network-based model which can predict TAD disruption as a function of CNV breakpoints. In this proposal we aim to make ClinTAD the premier tool for the interpretation of CNVs in the context of TAD disruption. Our long- term goal is to build a collaborative network of users that will enable us to identify patients with the most probability of having clinical phenotypes caused by TAD disruption. Such a unique patient cohort could then form the basis of a first-of-its kind trial to evaluate the utility of Hi-C as a clinical test. PROJECT NARRATIVE Children with conditions such as autism, developmental delay, and other abnormalities found at birth frequent have a medical test done called DNA microarray. While this test is certainly useful, we believe that this test is missing the correct diagnosis in some patients because of limitations in current guidelines for interpreting test data.

"Predoctoral to Postdoctoral Research Training in ctDNA Biology for Liquid Biopsy of Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) which mirrors the parental tumor, is present in the plasma of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patients. Liquid biopsy analysis of ctDNA allows early detection and genetic monitoring. However, current PCR-based liquid biopsy methods often have difficulty detecting ctDNA due to low copies in circulation. In contrast, the electric field-induced release and measurement liquid biopsy (eLB) platform, detects mutant EGFR (L858R, exon19del, T790M) ctDNA with a >90% tissue-genotype concordance in <50ul of unprocessed plasma of NSCLC patients. Preliminary data demonstrate that the ctDNA detected by eLB may be ultrashort single-stranded ctDNA (usssctDNA) which contrasts the typically described 160-basepair internucleosomal double-stranded ctDNA. This new subpopulation is undetectable through PCR-based liquid biopsy methods due to size-selection bias. The goal of the F99 Phase is to use usssctDNA-seq, a novel NGS pipeline, to explore if NSCLC plasma contains high quantities of ctDNA that are ultrashort and single-stranded. This pipeline consists of a usssctDNA-specific extraction, library preparation, deep sequencing, and bioinformatic analysis. To verify, 80 late-stage NSCLC EGFR-mutated plasma samples will undergo usssctDNA-seq. The discovery of usssctDNA will open up a wealth of previously unnoticed information leading to improved treatment and survival of NSCLC patients. Afterward, during the K00 Phase, the trainee hopes to explore the biological origins of biofluid ctDNA and the incorporation of usssctDNA into modern multi-analyte approaches for pan- cancer detection. This will involve training in new skills such as organoid modeling, methylation and leukocyte sequencing, and bioinformatic machine learning at a world-leading cancer-oriented institute. Ultimately, the goal of this proposed F99/K00 project will to prepare the trainee for a career in cancer research with an expertise in liquid biopsy and cell-free DNA biology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research in the first phase of this proposal is to investigate a new methodology to capture and define a novel ultrashort circulating tumor DNA species in the plasma of lung cancer patients. In the second phase, the usage of various other molecules additional to the ultrashort DNA species in biofluids will be explored in hopes to detect multiple cancer types with liquid biopsy. These findings will contribute to improved clinical outcomes for cancer patients by leading to the development of new liquid biopsy approaches for improved detection and treatment

"Measuring functional similarity between transcriptional enhancers using deep learning PROJECT SUMMARY Understanding transcriptional regulation remains as a major task in the molecular biology ﬁeld. Enhancers are genetic elements that regulate when and where genes are expressed and their expression levels. These elements are hard to discover because their locations and orientations are not constrained with respect to their target genes. Several diseases and susceptibility to certain diseases are linked to mutations and variants in enhancers. Multiple experimental and computational methods have been developed for locating enhancers. Computational methods are more suitable to handle the large number of genomes being sequenced now because they are faster, cheaper, and less labor intensive than experimental methods. Despite many available computational tools, we lack a sophisticated tool that can measure similarity in the enhancer activity of a pair of sequences. We propose here utilizing Deep Artiﬁcial Neural Networks (DANNs) to develop such a tool. The long-term objective of this project is to decipher the code governing gene regulation with the following speciﬁc aims: (i) design a computational tool for measuring enhancer-enhancer similarity, (ii) validate up to 96 putative enhancers experimentally, (iii) understand enhancer grammar, and (iv) annotate enhancers in more than 50 insect genomes. To achieve these aims, a novel application of DANNs is proposed. Current tools utilize DANNs to answer a yes-no question: does a sequence have similar activity to the tissue-speciﬁc enhancers comprising a particular training set of known enhancers? These approaches require training a separate network on each tissue, leading to inconsistent performances on different tissues. Instead, here we use a DANN to answer a related but different question: does this sequence have similar enhancer activity to a single known tissue-speciﬁc enhancer? This deep network should perform consistently on different cell types because it is trained on pairs of sequences — not individual sequences as is the case in the available tools — representing all tissues for which there are known enhancers. The DANN is trained to recognize sequence pairs with similar enhancer activities and those with dissimilar activities including (i) two enhancers active in two different tissues, (ii) one enhancer and a random genomic sequence, and (iii) two random genomic sequences. The tool outputs a score between 0 and 1, indicating how similar the enhancer activities of the two sequences are. Using a much simpler machine learning algorithm than DANNs, we demonstrate that pairs with similar enhancer activities can be separated from pairs of random genomic sequences or pairs of one enhancer and a random genomic sequence with a very high accuracy. The new tool has many important potential applications including consistent annotation of enhancers across cell types and related species. Our tool can annotate enhancers active in a cell type that has a small number of known enhancers, and it can annotate enhancers in related genomes when there is a set of known enhancers demarcated in one of them. Discovering new transcription factor binding sites is another potential application. Studying enhancer “design principles” and the effects of variants can be facilitated using the proposed tool. Such applications will advance our ﬁeld. PROJECT NARRATIVE An enhancer is a genetic element that controls when and in which cell type a gene is expressed as well as the expression level. Mutations and variants in enhancers are linked to a number of diseases — including cancer — and may increase the risk of developing certain diseases. We will apply machine learning (a branch of artiﬁcial intelligence) and experimental approaches to developing an advanced computational tool that measures the similarity in enhancer activity between two DNA regions, facilitating the discovery of enhancers and their study.",Measuring functional similarity between transcriptional enhancers using deep learning,10302539,R21HG011507,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Order Coleoptera ', ' Beetles ', ' Coleoptera ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Diptera ', ' True Flies ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease susceptibility ', ' Diathesis ', ' liability to disease ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Drosophila genus ', ' Drosophila ', ' fruit fly ', ' Drosophila melanogaster ', ' Elements ', ' Genetic Enhancer Element ', ' Enhancer Elements ', ' enhancer sequence ', ' genetic enhancer sequence ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Hymenoptera ', ' Insecta ', ' Insects ', ' Insects Invertebrates ', ' Learning ', ' Lepidoptera ', ' Methods ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Physiological Processes ', ' Organism-Level Process ', ' Organismal Process ', ' Physiologic Processes ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Measures ', ' Enhancers ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Reporter Genes ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Distant ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Performance ', ' genetic element ', ' transgenic ', ' Transgenic Organisms ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Mutate ', ' Molecular ', ' Output ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Consumption ', ' sequence learning ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' artificial neural network ', ' artificial neural net ', ' computational neural network ', ' synthetic neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' ']",NHGRI,TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY-KINGSVILLE,R21,2021,367891,TX-34
"Spectroscopy Assisted Laser Microdissection Abstract Molecular understanding of tumors relies greatly on appropriate samples to be prepared from epithelial cells in tissues. Epithelial cells, however, are often surrounded by other cell types and extracting pure populations of these cells is crucial for correct biospecimen preparation and resulting accuracy of molecular assays. Laser microdissection (LM) has contributed immensely in this effort due to its high spatial specificity in the extraction of defined cell populations and ease of use. While LM has enhanced the precision of biochemical analysis, several drawbacks remain. The necessity of staining and human supervision limits throughput, molecular yield and purity of samples. There is little explicit control or confidence in the purity of extracted cell populations while it is difficult to extract multiple cells from the same sample. Combining the morphologic specificity of microscopy and molecular sensitivity of spectroscopy, infrared (IR) spectroscopic imaging been employed to automate histopathologic recognition in complex tissues using artificial intelligence algorithms applied of spectral data. This project will demonstrate a completely automated instrument by coupling LM with IR microscopy. Termed spectroscopy-assisted laser microdissection (SLaM), the developed prototype will be validated using state of the art IR imaging systems and commercial LCM in terms of accuracy, speed and type fidelity. Last, the approach will be applied to extract cells of different types from the same prostate sample to demonstrate the capability to multiplex LM (muxLM) from the same tissue. The project directly addresses the need to reduce the time- and labor-intensive nature of LM. SLaM can maximize the quality and utility of biological samples used for downstream analyses by automation, high throughput and precision while enabling a comprehensive acquisition of cells without user fatigue or error, thereby providing a sample of higher integrity and quality for cancer molecular analysis. Project Narrative This project seeks to systematically develop and validate a new instrument for laser microdissection (LM). This infrared spectroscopic imaging powered prototype will recognize cells without staining, automates the laser capture of these cells and allows them to be extracted for biochemical assays at faster speed and higher accuracy than available with current technology. Since LM is critical to sample preparation in complex tissue, this project will make tissue-based analyses high throughput, automated and easier to use in biomedical research and in clinical protocols.",Spectroscopy Assisted Laser Microdissection,10284780,R21CA263147,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Attention ', ' Automation ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Carcinoma ', ' Epithelial cancer ', ' Malignant Epithelial Neoplasms ', ' Malignant Epithelial Tumors ', ' epithelial carcinoma ', ' Cell Extracts ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clinical Protocols ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dissection ', ' Dyes ', ' Coloring Agents ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Fibroblasts ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Histology ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybrids ', ' instrumentation ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Microscopy ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Polymers ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Research ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Specificity ', ' Spectrum Analysis ', ' Spectroscopy ', ' Spectrum Analyses ', ' Stains ', ' Staining method ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Twin Multiple Birth ', ' Twins ', ' Measures ', ' Film ', ' Stromal Cells ', ' Tube ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Microscopic ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Chemicals ', ' Epithelial ', ' Tissue Stains ', ' Spottings ', ' Morphology ', ' Pathologist ', ' instrument ', ' Nature ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' Reaction ', ' Slide ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' interest ', ' infrared microscopy ', ' molecular pathology ', ' Performance ', ' Microdissection ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' Speed ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' design and construct ', ' design and construction ', ' Sampling ', ' high throughput analysis ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' mixed cell culture ', ' laser capture microdissection ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Analysis ', ' Structural Chemistry ', ' Collecting Cell ', ' Collection ', ' Slice ', ' Tissue Model ', ' Validation ', ' Preparation ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' tumor microenvironment ', ' cancer microenvironment ', ' anticancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' spectroscopic imaging ', ' imaging spectroscopy ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Population ', ' Coupling ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' user-friendly ', ' prototype ', ' tumor ', ' clinical care ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' NGS Method ', ' NGS system ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' imaging system ', ' clinical diagnostics ', ' preservation ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2021,188193,IL-13
"Model-guided design of next-generation bacterial therapeutics to treat cardiovascular disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT It is becoming increasingly evident that the composition and metabolites produced by the human gut microbiome influence the progression of cardiovascular diseases. While we are continuing to discover important associations between the gut microbiome and human physiology and diseases, we lack the tools and methodology to precisely manipulate gut microbiota to benefit human health. We propose to develop computational models and optimization frameworks to predict community dynamics and functions and design interventions to shift the gut microbiome to desired states. We will design novel bacterial therapeutics that operate autonomously in the mammalian gastrointestinal tract to steer the microbiome towards healthy states. These next-generation bacterial therapeutics will sense important gut microbiome metabolites, process information, and deliver species- specific antimicrobial proteins to reshape the dynamics and functions of this ecosystem. The performance of these bacterial therapeutics will be characterized in vitro using synthetic human gut microbiome communities and in gnotobiotic mouse models of cardiovascular disease. Model-guided microbiome engineering has the potential to transform human medicine and is becoming increasingly important as scientists continue to discover connections between the microbiome and human health and disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent studies have shown close connections between the human gut microbiome and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which are the leading cause of death worldwide. While engineering of the gut microbiome holds tremendous potential as a novel therapeutic strategy for CVD, we currently lack the tools and methodology required to design interventions that precisely shift the structure and function of the gut microbiome.

"Advancing the Measurement and Classification of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction PROJECT SUMMARY Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are common with high economic and social costs and significant effects on patients’ quality of life. Prevalence of LUTS increases with age, with estimates ranging from 45-70% of U.S. adults. It is clear from the range of conditions that produce LUTS, and the failure of current therapies to ameliorate symptoms in large segments of the population that have similar LUTS, that patients with LUTS are a heterogeneous population even when their symptoms are identical or overlap. Current LUTS treatment paradigms target narrow symptom groups, largely ignoring the heterogeneity in concomitant symptoms. Furthermore, clinicians have a limited understanding on how to integrate information from self-reported symptoms, clinical exam and laboratory results, and urodynamic testing into treatment decision-making. Improving treatment outcomes for patients with LUTS will require both (1) increased understanding of LUTS symptom clusters and underlying mechanisms behind the various subtypes and (2) comprehensive, validated, and responsive measurement tools for defining treatment efficacy. The Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network (LURN) was assembled in 2012, the primary objective of which was to categorize patients with LUTS into distinct subgroups, a process known as ‘phenotyping’. The Network’s approach to defining patient subtypes was based on a probability-based consensus clustering approach using a myriad of patient data, resulting in the identification of novel LUTS-based clusters that are statistically and clinically distinct. Concurrently, the Network worked to improve the measurement of patient reports of LUTS through systematic development of a new, high-quality item bank based on qualitative input from patients, community participants, internists, urologists, urogynecologists, and clinical researchers. LURN II will build on the knowledge gained through multiple specific aims: to test and refine the original LURN clustering model in a new cohort including a wider range of symptom severity and a wider range of physical measures (n=1380 participants followed for 3 years); to identify a signature of proteins contained within plasma that can be used to identify specific subgroups of men and women with LUTS; to determine phenotypic characteristics of women with LUTS by measuring the functional components of the lower urinary tract; to validate a self-reported outcome tool for evaluating treatments, based on the comprehensive tool developed for phenotyping in LURN I; and to explore promising alternative analytic approaches to existing and future LURN data and characterize the broader experiences of patients with LUTS. This proposal brings together a multidisciplinary team of urologists, urogynecologists, bladder physiologists, data scientists, epidemiologists, and outcomes researchers. The proposed work has the potential to transform the diagnosis and treatment of LUTS.

"Incorporating molecular network knowledge into predictive data-driven models Modern computational techniques based on machine-learning (ML) and, more recently, deep-learning (DL) are playing a critical role in realizing the precision medicine initiative. However, there is a critical need to systematically combine these powerful data-driven techniques with prior molecular network knowledge to make more accurate predictive models while also satisfactorily explaining their predictions in terms of mechanisms underlying complex traits and diseases. I propose to use domain specific knowledge from biology and computing to tackle three outstanding problems: 1) how to predict missing labels associated with millions of publicly available samples? 2) what molecular/cellular function can be attached to these samples and 3) how can we translate the findings from human data to a model species and back? ​Network-constrained Deep Learning for Metadata Imputation: ​​Most multifactorial phenotypes are tissue dependent and manifest differently depending on age, sex, and ethnicity. However, a majority of publicly-available genomic data lack these labels. I will develop a network-guided approach to predict missing metadata of samples based on their expression profiles by designing novel data-driven models where the model architecture and/or structure of the input data are constrained by an underlying gene network. ​Network-guided Functional Analysis of Genomic Data: ​​High-throughput experiments often generate lists of genes of interest that are hard to interpret. Functional enrichment analysis (FEA) is a powerful tool that attaches functional meaning to an experimental set of genes by summarizing them into sets of pathways/processes. However, standard FEA analysis is limited by incomplete knowledge of gene function, lack of context of the underlying gene network, and noise in expression data. I will address these limitations by developing a network-guided approach that jointly captures genes, their interactions, and their known biological pathways/processes into a common, low-dimensional space that facilitates deriving biological meaning by comparing the distance between the experimental gene set and the pathway/process of interest. ​Joint Multi-Species Genomic Data Analysis and Knowledge Transfer: ​​In particular, finding the optimal model system to use in a follow-up study based on genetic signatures derived from human experiments is challenging because genetic networks can be quite different from species to species. I propose to use data-driven models to embed heterogeneous networks comprised of human genes and model species genes into a common, low-dimensional space to better compare genetic signatures between two (or even multiple) species. I will apply these methods to three specific tasks, but I emphasize that the results of this study will be transferable to any other biological problem where complex gene/protein interactions are a major component. I have surrounded myself with a great support team and developed a strong professional development plan. The freedom and support provided by the F32 fellowship will be instrumental in achieving my goal of becoming a professor with an independent research group. This proposal aims to develop novel computational approaches that systematically combine prior molecular network knowledge, powerful data-driven computational techniques, and large transcriptome data collections to answer three critical questions in biomedicine: 1) how to predict missing labels associated with millions of publicly available samples? 2) what molecular/cellular function can be attached to these samples and 3) how can we translate the findings from human data to a model species and back? The core goal of my fellowship is to achieve this by infusing prior-knowledge into state-of-the-art data-driven statistical/machine learning methods so that we can overcome two major hurdles in studying complex, multifactorial traits and diseases: a) complex genetic interactions underlie multi-factorial traits and diseases, and b) these traits and diseases often differ in how they manifest from patient to patient.",Incorporating molecular network knowledge into predictive data-driven models,10246414,F32GM134595,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Biology ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Fellowship ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Joints ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Modernization ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Biological ', ' Development Plans ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Genetic ', ' gene function ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' human data ', ' professor ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Protein Gene Products ', ' Gene Proteins ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' functional genomics ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' genetic association ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' disease phenotype ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' driving force ', ' mathematical sciences ', ' math sciences ', ' mathematic sciences ', ' Precision Medicine Initiative ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' genomic profiles ', ' genetic signature ', ' gene signatures ', ' data to knowledge ', ' data into knowledge ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' deep learning ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,F32,2021,70458,MI-08
"AI based system for longitudinal, repeated measure analyses of freely moving C. elegans worms Abstract This project aims to develop WormInvestigator™, a novel, highly innovative system for performing automated, high-throughput and longitudinal studies of the behavior of C. elegans worms freely moving and socially interacting on agar plates (hereafter: ""freely moving worms"") across multiple time points over extended times (e.g., multiple days) with repeated measures designs. Work in Phase I will focus on demonstrating feasibility of our novel, patent pending, WormRecognizer™ technology – the ability to perform automatic, image-based identification of individual C. elegans worms within a group of freely moving worms (""digital tagging of freely moving worms""). Work in Phase II will focus on creating the full functionality of WormInvestigator for the commercial release. The innovation inherent in WormRecognizer will serve as the basis for enabling a game- changing innovation in the field – the ability to perform high throughput longitudinal, repeated measures design analyses of locomotion and other behavior of freely moving C. elegans worms from discrete, non-continuous video sequences. Compared to study designs that have independent groups repeated measures designs offer more statistical power and the possibility to track an effect over time. Specifically, repeated measures designs for analyzing locomotion and other behavior of freely moving worms will allow researchers to definitively assess the likelihood that a particular behavior is associated with a prior behavior, which is impossible without repeated measures designs or impractical continuous imaging and tracking under constant illumination. WormRecognizer will leverage the Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to perform automatic identification of the tracks of the same worm in videos of groups of freely moving worms recorded at different time points; encouraging pilot data were generated during preparation of this application. C. elegans is increasingly used as a model organism in research focusing on brain mechanisms underlying complex behaviors and pathological alterations thereof, including research into neurodevelopment, Alzheimer's disease, autism, schizophrenia and traumatic brain injury. Thus, WormInvestigator will enable significant advancements in various mental neuroscience applications that use C. elegans as a model organism. Specifically, the fact that C. elegans express many of the neurotransmitters and associated receptors that are found in higher eukaryotes, including humans, makes C. elegans highly attractive for the (high throughput) screening of next generation therapeutics for mental diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, as well as for disorders that rely on neurotransmitter release modulation such as next generation treatments for schizophrenia. We will perform extensive feasibility studies, product validation and usability studies of WormInvestigator in close collaboration with expert neuroscientists. Market research performed during preparation of this application indicated that WormInvestigator will expand the use of C. elegans as a model organism to many laboratories that do not currently use them. A competing technology is not available. We anticipate the global market size for WormInvestigator to be more than 300 systems. Narrative Performing longitudinal studies and repeated measures design analyses in both short-term and long-term experimental assays focusing on the analysis of locomotion and other behavior of multiple C. elegans worms holds the promise of profound progress in next-generation neuroscience studies such as understanding neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, as well as aging research, drug discovery and toxicology. Our proposed product will be a transformative technology, using new analytical methods based on artificial intelligence algorithms that, for the first time, will enable researchers to perform these data-rich longitudinal studies and, thus, repeated measures design analyses in assays using C. elegans as a model organism. This system will allow researchers to make new discoveries based on new studies that are currently not feasible, ultimately providing the basis for developing novel treatments to prevent and fight

"A robust platform for multiplexed, subcellular proteomic imaging in human tissue Project Summary Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging by Time of Flight (MIBI-TOF) uses secondary ion mass spectrometry and metal conjugated primary antibodies to simultaneously visualize dozens of proteins at subcellular resolution in a single tissue section. This technology is back compatible with archival formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue (FFPE) and has been used in peer-reviewed work to simultaneously visualize and quantify 36 proteins in retrospective human tissue cohorts. In line with the stated goals of the HuBMAP consortium to develop both “High-sensitivity, high-resolution imaging techniques that can rapidly provide spectral data over large areas of tissue” and “Quantitative imaging analysis tools, including automated 3D image segmentation, feature extraction, and image annotation,” the work outlined here will create a standardized, high throughput, and user-friendly workflow for using MIBI-TOF in basic and translational research to gain insight into how single cell phenotype and tissue structure are functionally-linked in health and disease. To achieve this, we will validate 100 FFPE antibodies and optimize ready-to-use multiplexed staining panels in lyophilized format that will permit storage for at least two years. Protocols and reagents for multiplexed signal amplification of protein and mRNA targets will be further refined, while next generation instrumentation will increase sample throughput to permit full tissue section imaging of up to 40 proteins in 1 hour. Standardized reagents and more robust instrumentation will be accompanied by an automated computational pipeline that utilizes a standard set of segmentation markers and machine learning to accurately identify nuclei and cell borders in any non-neural human tissue. This data will be used to cluster single cell events into functionally distinct populations according to morphology, protein expression, and histological distribution. The reagents and computational pipeline proposed here synergize with existing HuBMAP-funded platforms and could be readily generalized to virtually any high dimensional imaging modality. Thus, this work will not only provide a practical, back compatible imaging platform for high throughput multiplexed imaging, but will also accelerate development of other complimentary imaging technologies as well. Project Narrative Multiplexed ion beam imaging by time of flight (MIBI-TOF) is a new technology for visualizing dozens of proteins in standard clinical tissue biopsies at high resolution. The work outlined here will create a standardized, high throughput, and user-friendly workflow for using MIBI-TOF in basic and translational research to gain insight into how single cell phenotype and tissue structure are functionally-linked in health and disease.","A robust platform for multiplexed, subcellular proteomic imaging in human tissue",10247827,UH3CA246633,"['Antibodies ', ' Archives ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Biopsy ', ' Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' DCIS ', ' Ductal Breast Carcinoma In Situ ', ' Ductal Carcinoma In Situ ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Invasive Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Decidua ', ' Decidua Graviditas ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Equipment ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Freeze Drying ', ' Freeze Dryings ', ' Lyophilization ', ' Goals ', ' Granuloma ', ' Granulomatous Lesion ', ' Health ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunosuppression ', ' Immunosuppression Effect ', ' Immunosuppressive Effect ', ' immune suppression ', ' Institutes ', ' instrumentation ', ' Ions ', ' Metals ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Pathology ', ' Peer Review ', ' Phenotype ', ' First Pregnancy Trimester ', ' 1st trimester ', ' Early Placental Phase ', ' First Trimester ', ' Proteins ', ' Reagent ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Stains ', ' Staining method ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Pulmonary Tuberculosis ', ' Lung TB ', ' Lung Tuberculosis ', ' Pulmonary TB ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Tissue Embedding ', ' Paraffin Embedding ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Organ ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Spectrometry, Mass, Secondary Ion ', ' SIMS Microscopy ', ' Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry Microscopy ', ' Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy Microscopy ', ' Spectroscopy, Mass, Secondary Ion ', ' Funding ', ' cancer immunotherapy ', ' anti-cancer immunotherapy ', ' anticancer immunotherapy ', ' immune-based cancer therapies ', ' immunotherapy for cancer ', ' immunotherapy of cancer ', ' Letters ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Hour ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' human tissue ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Medical center ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Allergic ', ' Sampling ', ' Proteomics ', ' Formalin ', ' protein expression ', ' 3-D Images ', ' 3-D image ', ' 3D image ', ' 3D images ', ' Three-Dimensional Image ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' reagent standardization ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' EXTMR ', ' Extramural ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' technology validation ', ' technology implementation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' tumor microenvironment ', ' cancer microenvironment ', ' ion source ', ' virtual ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Population ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' user-friendly ', ' graphical user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' software user interface ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' cloud computer ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' imaging platform ', ' high resolution imaging ', ' human imaging ', ' high dimensionality ', ' Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging ', ' multiplexed imaging ', ' computational platform ', ' computing platform ', ' Human BioMolecular Atlas Program ', ' HuBMAP ', ' computational pipelines ', ' feature extraction ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,UH3,2021,547000,CA-18
"Diversity Supplement Project Summary The goal of this Diversity Supplement Application is to provide an in-depth research experience and strengthen the scientific background of Paola Marquez-Gomez to enable her to access and thrive at a graduate program or medical school. Toward this goal, Paola will work on an extension project of the paneer award engineering an orthogonal Gαs-coupled Designer G protein-couple receptor activated by designer drug (DREADD) to enable the multiplex activation of GPCR signaling pathways in mammalian cells. This work is significant because multiplex activation of GPCR signaling in mammalian cells would allow the study of GPCR signaling crosstalk and its effect on cellular phenotype, and, in the future, animal behavior. This work is innovative because it leverages experimental and chemoinformatics data to train a machine learning algorithm to engineer the substrate specificity of GPCRs for which no crystal structure is available. Project Narrative G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are targeted by 30% of all approved drugs, and a full understanding of how they activate intracellular signaling pathways and their effect on complex behavior is key to the development of new and safer therapeutics. We propose engineering the substrate specificity of a GPCR such that it can be activated independently of other GPCRs naturally presented on the cell surface. Such a GPCR could be used to study how GPCR signaling pathways interact with one another with implications for understanding complex cell signaling and animal behavior.",Diversity Supplement,10443343,R35GM124871,"['Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Animal Behavior ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chemical Engineering ', ' Clozapine ', ' Crystallization ', ' Designer Drugs ', ' Customized Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Engineering ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Laboratories ', ' Libraries ', ' Ligands ', ' Logic ', ' Luciferases ', ' Luciferase Immunologic ', ' Mentors ', ' Muscarinics ', ' Muscarinic Agents ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Oxides ', ' Phenotype ', ' physical science ', ' serotonin receptor ', ' 5-HT Receptors ', ' 5-Hydroxytryptamine Receptors ', ' Research ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Science ', ' Serotonin ', ' 5-HT ', ' 5-Hydroxytryptamine ', ' 5HT ', ' Enteramine ', ' Hippophaine ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Substrate Specificity ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Yeasts ', ' kappa opioid receptors ', ' kappa opiate ', ' kappa opioid ', ' κ opiate ', ' κ opioid ', ' κ opioid receptors ', ' κ-OR ', ' κOR ', ' GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs ', ' G(s), alpha Subunit ', ' G(s), α Subunit ', ' G(s)alpha ', ' G(s)α ', ' GTP-Binding Protein α Subunits, Gs ', ' Gs alpha Family G-Protein ', ' Gsα ', ' Gαs ', ' Regulatory Ns Protein ', ' Stimulatory Gs G-Protein ', ' alpha Subunit Stimulatory GTP-Binding Protein ', ' alpha-Gs ', ' α-Gs ', ' beta-arrestin ', ' arrestin B ', ' β-arrestin ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Reporter Genes ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Orphan ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' cell mediated therapies ', ' cell-based therapeutic ', ' cell-based therapy ', ' cellular therapy ', ' Cell Therapy ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' experience ', ' mutant ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' chemical library ', ' small molecule libraries ', ' Structure ', ' member ', ' G Protein-Complex Receptor ', ' G Protein-Coupled Receptor Genes ', ' GPCR ', ' G-Protein-Coupled Receptors ', ' olfactory receptor ', ' Cell surface ', ' response ', ' High Throughput Assay ', ' high throughput screening ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Mammalian Cell ', ' Receptor Signaling ', ' in vivo ', ' G Protein-Coupled Receptor Signaling ', ' GPCR Signaling ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' Docking ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' desensitization ', ' Coupled ', ' Coupling ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' combinatorial ', ' STEM field ', ' STEM class ', ' STEM course ', ' STEM discipline ', ' STEM major ', ' science, technology, engineering and math class ', ' science, technology, engineering and math course ', ' science, technology, engineering and math discipline ', ' science, technology, engineering and math field ', ' science, technology, engineering and math major ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics class ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics course ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics discipline ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics field ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics major ', ' screening ', ' designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs ', ' DREADDs ', ' sensor technology ', ' sensing technology ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' ']",NIGMS,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R35,2021,72562,GA-05
"Identifying existing, FDA-approved drugs with clinically protective effects against coronavirus disease 2019 using a big data approach Project Summary/Abstract Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a national and global public health emergency. Because the causative virus is novel, the present options for treatment are extremely limited, and an effective vaccine could be 1-2 years away. Thus, there is an urgent need for efficacious therapeutics against the disease. While development of new drugs is under way, that process is slow and resource-intensive. In the short-to-medium term, a superior strategy is to repurpose already existing drugs to treat the disease. Over 100 drugs already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have shown in vitro, in silico, or theoretical effect against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, or the hyperinflammatory immune response it provokes. What is unclear is how many of these have a significant, protective effect on actual patients, as only a tiny fraction of these drugs is in clinical trials. Most of these agents are chronic medications, and thus there are millions of Americans who are already using them. The first aim of this study is to assess the degree of protection any of these drugs confers against the serious complications of COVID-19 while adjusting for known risk factors and confounders. The second aim is to search for additional interactions between drugs or combinations of drugs and specific demographic and/or clinical subgroups that could be protective or harmful. The Change Healthcare Database, a part of the COVID-19 Research Database, contains up-to-date health insurance claims data for about one-third of all Americans. Using this database, this study will evaluate the impact of these drugs on the risk of four important outcomes in patients who are COVID-19-positive: need for hospitalization, use of mechanical ventilation, shock, and death. Results will be risk-adjusted for the risk factors already well established to predict poor outcomes in COVID-19. This study will further mine the data for second- and third- order interactions between drugs or combinations of drugs and different subpopulations of patients using a novel machine learning method called the Feasible Solution Algorithm (FSA). The FSA enables the researcher to uncover higher-order statistical interactions in regression models, which leads to the identification of subgroups and complexities that are not always apparent with traditional regression models. If the results show candidate drugs with highly protective effects, these can be prioritized for prospective clinical studies. Drugs that show harmful effects can be considered for discontinuation in infected or high-risk patients. Project Narrative Repurposing existing drugs to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) is a much faster and more resource-effective approach than developing new drugs de novo. This holds promise because over 100 drugs already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have shown in vitro, in silico, or theoretical activity against SARSCoV-2 or the immune response it provokes. Using a large health insurance claims database, we will assess the potentially protective effects of each of these drugs on patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and search for interactions between multiple drugs and specific demographic and clinical subpopulations via a novel statistical algorithm.","Identifying existing, FDA-approved drugs with clinically protective effects against coronavirus disease 2019 using a big data approach",10395043,R21LM013683,"['Algorithms ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug Combinations ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' In Vitro ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Shock ', ' Circulatory Collapse ', ' circulatory shock ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' USFDA ', ' Vaccines ', ' Virus ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mechanical ventilation ', ' mechanical respiratory assist ', ' mechanically ventilated ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Therapeutic ', ' American ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' protective effect ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' high risk ', ' drug candidate ', ' public health emergency ', ' Statistical Algorithm ', ' Statistics Algorithm ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' insurance claims ', ' COVID-19 ', ' COVID19 ', ' CV-19 ', ' CV19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' 2019-nCoV ', ' 2019 novel corona virus ', ' 2019 novel coronavirus ', ' COVID-19 virus ', ' COVID19 virus ', ' CoV-2 ', ' CoV2 ', ' SARS corona virus 2 ', ' SARS-CoV-2 ', ' SARS-CoV2 ', ' SARS-associated corona virus 2 ', ' SARS-associated coronavirus 2 ', ' SARS-coronavirus-2 ', ' SARS-related corona virus 2 ', ' SARS-related coronavirus 2 ', ' SARSCoV2 ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome CoV 2 ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Corona Virus 2 ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Coronavirus 2 ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-associated coronavirus 2 ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus 2 ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome associated corona virus 2 ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome related corona virus 2 ', ' Wuhan coronavirus ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 virus ', ' hCoV19 ', ' nCoV2 ', ' in silico ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' coronavirus disease ', ' COVID ', ' CoV disease ', ' corona virus disease ', ' COVID-19 treatment ', ' COVID-19 therapy ', ' COVID19 therapy ', ' COVID19 treatment ', ' SARS-CoV-2 therapy ', ' SARS-CoV-2 treatment ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 therapy ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 treatment ', ' severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 therapy ', ' severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 treatment ', ' treat COVID-19 ', ' treat COVID19 ', ' treat SARS-CoV-2 ', ' treat coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' treat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ', ' SARS-CoV-2 positive ', ' COVID-19 positive ', ' COVID-19 positivity ', ' COVID19 positive ', ' COVID19 positivity ', ' SARS-CoV-2 positivity ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positivity ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 positive ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 positivity ', ' COVID-19 diagnosis ', ' COVID19 diagnosis ', ' SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 diagnosis ', ' diagnosed with COVID-19 ', ' diagnosed with COVID19 ', ' diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 ', ' diagnosed with coronavirus 2019 ', ' diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 diagnosis ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,R21,2021,245839,OH-01
"Development of a novel approach to characterize human chemosensory perception PROJECT SUMMARY The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has raised public awareness of the importance of the chemical senses, and highlighted the need for better clinical tools to test them due to the significant underestimation of chemosensory loss related to COVID-19 in early 2020. The recently developed Monell Flavor Quiz (MFQ) directly addresses these key deficiencies by enabling comprehensive objective measurement of chemosensation (smell, taste, and chemesthesis) and is available for nationwide distribution. Developed as an accessible test, the MFQ can capture a more representative sample—no longer limited by geographical or logistical constraints, it enables people to monitor their taste and smell ability in the convenience of their own home. To address the complexity in chemosensory ability, the MFQ is designed to bridge the gap between changes in chemosensation and liking to better understand effects of chemosensory dysfunction on overall dietary quality. This proposal aims to (a) deploy the MFQ to characterize subtypes of chemosensory dysfunction (e.g., those suffering from co- occurring chemosensory dysfunction due to COVID-19) and (b) assess the reliability and validity of a self-administered MFQ against standardized measures of chemosensation. Aim I will address chemosensation ability in four separate cohorts, differing in their chemosensory ability (e.g., loss of smell or loss of taste), and link chemosensory perception and liking to overall diet healthiness; this information can aid in downstream development of targeted interventions for complex chemosensory disorders. Aim II will compare the reliability of the MFQ across modes of execution (self-administered vs. in-person), across time (2-week lapse), and validate it against standardized measures of smell and taste. Directly in alignment with NIDCD Priority Area # 1 in the Taste and Smell Program (understanding normal function; developing tools to measure taste and smell), the data from this project will lead to an adaptable yet comprehensive test to capture complex variations in taste and smell perception, as well as chemesthetic perception. The corresponding training plan in biomedical research supports my long-term research goal to understand the unique individual chemosensory experience and how it affects the perception of food and contributes to quality of life. PROJECT NARRATIVE There is a dearth of accessible and inclusive objective methods to measure taste and smell function, made evident by the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. To address this gap, we have developed a novel, comprehensive tool, the Monell Flavor Quiz, to assess taste, smell, and chemesthetic perception and liking at scale via remote testing. The goal of this project is to characterize new informative patient groups (e.g., those experiencing co-occurring chemosensory dysfunction from COVID-19), to confirm the MFQ’s reliability against existing, less accessible measures, and to validate its use for nationwide distribution.",Development of a novel approach to characterize human chemosensory perception,10389564,F32DC020100,"['Adult ',

"SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Medical professionals have recently put to rest the idea that there is an ideal weight loss diet for everyone. One cause for obesity is overeating, but we do not know what patterns and behaviors contribute to this problematic habit. Defining problematic eating behaviors that lead to energy imbalance is essential for treating obesity. Studies typically focus on a single putative causal mechanism of overeating such as stress or craving, not addressing the multiple features that co- occur with overeating. Hence, the factors that predict overeating episodes remain unknown, as do which of them contribute to an individual's consistency and variability of overeating. Given recent advancements in passive sensing, we now have the potential to detect problematic eating using seamlessly captured physiological features such as number of feeding gestures and swallows, and heart rate variability. Collecting detectable and predictable features that identify overeating will hone in on the patterns that interventionists may optimally target to help populations with obesity understand their eating habits and ultimately improve their ability to self- regulate their eating behaviors. Location-scale models will map the factors that most contribute to habit formation within subjects, providing interventionists with essential targets to guide behavior. The first aim is to collect sensor-based and ecological momentary assessment data (to assess factors not yet detectable through sensing) from adults with obesity and apply machine learning algorithms to identify a subset of features that detect overeating, as validated against ground truth of videotaped eating episodes and 24 hour dietary recall. Participants will wear a passive sensing sensor suite and respond to random and event-triggered prompts regarding each eating episode. Then, machine learning will determine the optimal feature subset that detect overeating episodes using Gradient Boosting Machines. In the second aim, hierarchical clustering techniques will cluster overeating episodes into theoretically meaningful and clinically known problematic behaviors related to overeating. The final aim is to build statistical models that explain the effect of detectable and clinically-known problematic features on new habit formation. These models will lay a foundation for optimization studies to discover evidence-based decision rules that can guide timely interventions to treat obesity by preventing overeating, and maintaining healthy eating behaviors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Obesity affects more than 33% of American adults while weight loss regimens rely on self- monitoring that many people struggle with. Wearable passive sensors allow us to learn an individual's problematic eating behaviors more easily. Analyzing sensor data then enables us to identify the essential factors that describe and even predict overeating, and ultimately provide personalized care that supports maintenance of healthy eating behaviors.",SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing.,10406434,K25DK113242,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Algorithms ', ' Appetitive Behavior ', ' Searching Behavior ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Medicine ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Energy Intake ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Computers ', ' Cues ', ' Deglutition ', ' Swallowing ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Family ', ' Feeding behaviors ', ' Ingestive Behavior ', ' feeding-related behaviors ', ' nutrient intake activity ', ' Foundations ', ' Gestures ', ' Goals ', ' Habits ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Hyperphagia ', ' Overeating ', ' polyphagia ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Maintenance ', ' Maps ', ' Mastication ', ' Chewing ', ' chewed ', ' chews ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Neck ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rest ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Videotape ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' body weight loss ', ' wt-loss ', ' Wrist ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Diet Habits ', ' Dietary Habits ', ' eating habit ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' participant recruitment ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Dietitian ', ' Scientist ', ' Hour ', ' Calories ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' computer science ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' social ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' craving ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Intake ', ' Monitor ', ' substance abuse treatment ', ' substance abuse therapy ', ' obesity treatment ', ' obesity intervention ', ' obesity therapy ', ' obesity prevention ', ' prevent obesity ', ' feeding ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Food Access ', ' Population ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' hedonic ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' evidence base ', ' heart rate variability ', ' emotional eating ', ' emotional eater ', ' Regimen ', ' algorithmic methodologies ', ' algorithmic methods ', ' personalized care ', ' Precision care ', ' individualized care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' Data Analytics ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable biosensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' adult obesity ', ' adult adiposity ', ' adults with obesity ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' adaptive intervention ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' behavioral phenotyping ', ' behavior phenotype ', ' obese person ', ' obese individuals ', ' obese people ', ' obese population ', ' obese subjects ', ' dietary ', ' ']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K25,2021,53790,IL-07
"Methods for Evolutionary Genomics Analysis PROJECT SUMMARY This administrative supplement request aims to develop a cloud-enabled, highly scalable version of the computational core of the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis software (MEGA-CC: www.megasoftware.net). The development of MEGA-CC is a significant component of the NIH-funded research project to develop machine learning methods and tools for comparative analysis of molecular sequences. With big advances in genome sequencing, researchers are assembling datasets containing large numbers of species, strains, genes, and genomic segments. Phylogenomic analyses of these data are essential to understanding the dynamics of evolutionary change of pathogens, humans, and species across the tree of life. Machine learning methods and software tools for phylogenomics are now necessary because the expanding size of phylogenomic datasets limits the practical utility of currently available methods and tools due to excessive computational time and memory requirements. One component of the funded grant is implementing our new machine learning methods in the MEGA software suite (www.megasoftware.net), an extremely popular bioinformatics software (>20,000 peer-reviewed citations and 350,000 software downloads in the year 2020 alone). The MEGA software includes a large repertoire of tools for assembling sequence alignments, inferring evolutionary trees, estimating genetic distances and diversities, inferring ancestral sequences, computing timetrees, and testing selection. These analyses are now required in all research investigations and fields in which multiple DNA or RNA sequences are used. However, MEGA and its computational core (MEGA-CC) are not optimized for distribution and execution on cloud infrastructure and high-performance computing clusters. This supplement to the funded grant will enable us to advance MEGA for cloud readiness to harness the scalability, elastic computing power, and easy software upgrade and maintenance enabled by cloud infrastructure (MEGA-CR). It will also make MEGA interoperable with existing and future cloud infrastructure. Additionally, this supplement will facilitate using the new machine learning methods in MEGA with big genomic data in practice, thus addressing an imminent and fast-growing need for an increasingly larger community of researchers using MEGA.

"Illuminating the Druggable Genome by Knowledge Graphs PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT About 1500 of the ~20,000 protein-coding genes of the human genome can bind drug-like molecules, and yet only about 600 are currently targeted by FDA-approved drugs. Therefore, at least 930 proteins are potential drug targets that are not yet being utilized for human medicine and, given our incomplete state of knowledge about the human genome, the actual number could be much higher. There is therefore a substantial unmet need to improve our understanding of this so-called genomic dark matter in order to develop novel classes of drugs to improve treatment of disease. Comprehensive experimental investigation of these proteins in the context of hundreds of thousands of compounds and thousands of diseases would be prohibitively expensive, but computational approaches could significantly refine the list. In this project we will apply two sophisticated computational approaches to the task of predicting the most promising novel drug targets. We will integrate the knowledge bases DrugCentral and other resources with the disease and phenotype knowledge base of the Monarch Initiative into a semantically harmonized knowledge graph (KG). This will result in a KG with comprehensive coverage of diseases, genes, gene functions, phenotypic abnormalities, drugs, drug mechanisms, and drug targets. Machine learning (ML) identifies patterns from training sets and applies the patterns to predict entities and relations in new data. ML using KGs has become a hot new research area in computer science, but remains difficult to use for real-world applications, owing to the lack of adequate software packages. We will therefore implement state-of-the art learning algorithms based on deep learning on KGs by extending and adapting selected algorithms to the task of drug and drug target discovery. We will develop an easy-to-use software library and demonstrate its use by means of notebooks that will be designed to serve as starting points for future computational research by other scientists, since they will contain the analysis workflow along with documentation about each step. The human genome codes more than 500 protein kinases, which are enzymes that add a phosphate group to specific amino acid residues and thereby transmit a biological signal. There are currently 35 FDA approved protein kinase modulators acting on 38 protein kinases, which are thus one of the most important groups of druggable proteins encoded by our genome. We will perform a detailed computational study of this group and experimentally validate our top, novel candidate using a patient-derived xenograft model system. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The human genome codes for over 20,000 proteins, roughly 3,000 of which are thought to be “druggable”, meaning that in principle they could be targeted by medications to treat disease. However, only about 600 of these proteins are currently targeted by an approved medication, and our knowledge about most of the remaining proteins is limited. Our goal is to develop bioinformatic software that will combine information about these proteins, diseases, clinical manifestations, medications, and other relevant data into a network of information (i.e., a graph), and to use sophisticated machine learning algorithms to predict novel drugs and drug targets. We will focus our computational strategy on the class of protein kinase inhibitors, which are a leading target for cancer drugs. The human genome encodes an estimated 555 kinases, 37 of which have been successfully targeted by anti-cancer medications. By using machine learning to predict which of the remaining 500+ protein kinases are most likely to be amenable to medical treatment, there is a potential to accelerate the pace of research into novel treatments. We will perform a pilot study of the top predicted candidates using a mouse model of cancer.",Illuminating the Druggable Genome by Knowledge Graphs,10348825,U01CA239108,"['Algorithms ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Antineoplastic Agents ', ' Anti-Cancer Agents ', ' Antineoplastic Drugs ', ' Antineoplastics ', ' Cancer Drug ', ' Neoplastic Disease Chemotherapeutic Agents ', ' Tumor-Specific Treatment Agents ', ' anti-cancer drug ', ' anticancer agent ', ' anticancer drug ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug Design ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Future ', ' gene therapy ', ' DNA Therapy ', ' Gene Transfer Clinical ', ' Genetic Intervention ', ' gene-based therapy ', ' genetic therapy ', ' genomic therapy ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Information Networks ', ' Libraries ', ' Medicine ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Pathology ', ' Phenotype ', ' inorganic phosphate ', ' Phosphates ', ' Phosphotransferases ', ' Kinases ', ' Phosphotransferase Gene ', ' Transphosphorylases ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Protein Kinase ', ' ATP-protein phosphotransferase ', ' Kinase Family Gene ', ' glycogen synthase a kinase ', ' hydroxyalkyl protein kinase ', ' phosphorylase b kinase kinase ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Semantics ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' protein kinase modulator ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' protein kinase inhibitor ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Pythons ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' gene function ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' catalog ', ' Catalogs ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' computer science ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' validation studies ', ' Categories ', ' Knowledge Management ', ' Information Resources Management ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Genomics ', ' Documentation ', ' drug discovery ', ' drug mechanism ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Adenock ', ' Allo-Puren ', ' Allozym ', ' Allural ', ' Aloprim ', ' Alositol ', ' Anoprolin ', ' Anzief ', ' Apulonga ', ' Apurin ', ' Apurol ', ' Bleminol ', ' Bloxanth ', ' Caplenal ', ' Cellidrin ', ' Cosuric ', ' Dabroson ', ' Embarin ', ' Epidropal ', ' Foligan ', ' Geapur ', ' Gichtex ', ' Hamarin ', ' Hexanurat ', ' Ketanrift ', ' Ketobun-A ', ' Ledopur ', ' Lopurin ', ' Lysuron ', ' Miniplanor ', ' Monarch ', ' Nektrohan ', ' Pan Quimica ', ' Remid ', ' Riball ', ' Suspendol ', ' Takanarumin ', ' Urbol ', ' Uricemil ', ' Uripurinol ', ' Urosin ', ' Urtias ', ' Xanturat ', ' Zyloprim ', ' Zyloric ', ' Aloral ', ' chemical informatics ', ' cheminformatics ', ' small molecule ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' The Jackson Laboratory ', ' Cancer Model ', ' CancerModel ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Emerging Technologies ', ' Emergent Technologies ', ' Ontology ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' disease phenotype ', ' computer studies ', ' computational studies ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' open source ', ' human disease ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' real world application ', ' high risk ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' new drug target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new therapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' FDA approved ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' dark matter ', ' novel drug class ', ' new drug class ', ' knowledge integration ', ' anti-cancer ', ' anticancer ', ' deep learning ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' learning algorithm ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' knowledge graph ', ' graph knowledge base ', ' graph knowledgebase ', ' genome resource ', ' patient derived xenograft model ', ' PDX model ', ' Patient derived xenograft ', ' drug repurposing ', ' repurposing agent ', ' repurposing medication ', ' ']",NCI,JACKSON LABORATORY,U01,2021,536615,ME-02
"Predicting post-transplant kidney function from pre-transplant biopsy and clinical biomarkers using a convolutional neural network PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The need for transplantable kidneys far exceeds their availability with over 90,000 candidates currently waitlisted but less than 22,000 transplants performed annually. Over 8,000 patients are removed from the waitlist each year due to death or deterioration in health while awaiting an offer. Despite this critical need for organs, nearly 20% of recovered kidneys are ultimately discarded. The most commonly reported reason for discard is unfavorable histology on donor biopsy. These pre-transplant biopsies are performed in order to assess the quality of the organ and are often used as a tool to predict post-implantation allograft performance. Unfortunately, the prognostic significance of biopsy findings is controversial and there is growing concern regarding the reliability and reproducibility of data derived from biopsy interpretation due to inter-pathologist variability. Recent evidence demonstrates that recipient graft outcomes correlate only with donor biopsy interpretation performed by an experienced renal pathologist. However, most transplant centers have no more than a handful of dedicated expert renal pathologists; given that organ recovery often occurs at remote hospitals late at night or on weekends, biopsies are usually interpreted by on-call pathologists without dedicated training in renal histology. These providers tend to overestimate the severity of chronic lesions, resulting in the inappropriate discard of otherwise acceptable organs. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a machine learning technique, can equal or exceed human performance in visual analysis tasks in an automated, objective fashion. We propose to leverage this new technology to accomplish the following aims: (1) To develop a CNN that reliably and accurately predicts post- transplant graft function from digitized procurement biopsy slides and donor and recipient metrics in the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) dataset; (2) To compare the predictive accuracy of our CNN to currently available donor risk scores; and (3) To qualitatively evaluate CNN adoptability, acceptability, and utility by clinicians. These aims are highly feasible given our group's expertise in machine learning, kidney transplantation, and analysis of SRTR data. We hypothesize that we can build a CNN that provides transplant physicians with accurate pre-operative real- time estimates of post-transplant graft success to help guide patient counseling. If the proposed aims are achieved, feedback from our CNN could prevent the inappropriate discard of thousands of kidneys and decrease waitlist mortality by increasing the number of transplants performed across the country. By conducting this research, Dr. Eagleson will cultivate a skillset that includes national registry data analysis, qualitative methods, and machine learning: important modern techniques that are rapidly becoming used throughout medicine and will serve her well throughout her career as an independent surgeon-scientist. PROJECT NARRATIVE Thousands of potentially transplantable kidneys are discarded every year, often based on misleading and inconsistent biopsy reads that are inevitable because of the logistics of organ offers. To overcome the current limitations of histologic assessment, we aim to develop, validate, and qualitatively evaluate a convolutional neural network (CNN) that accurately and reliably predicts post-transplant recipient kidney function from clinical biomarkers and a digitized pre-transplant donor biopsy slide. In addition to providing a real-time preoperative estimate of graft success to help guide patient-physician decision-making, our CNN could prevent the inappropriate discard of thousands of transplantable kidneys and decrease waitlist mortality by increasing the number of transplants performed across the country.",Predicting post-transplant kidney function from pre-transplant biopsy and clinical biomarkers using a convolutional neural network,10315165,F32DK128977,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biopsy ', ' Counseling ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Donor person ', ' transplant donor ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Feedback ', ' Glomerular Filtration Rate ', ' Health ', ' Histology ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Renal Grafting ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' kidney tx ', ' Learning ', ' Maryland ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Modernization ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Savings ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Standardization ', ' Statistical Computing ', ' statistical process ', ' statistical reasoning ', ' Supervision ', ' Time ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Specialist ', ' levan ', ' polyfructose ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' Visual ', ' Recovery ', ' Logistics ', ' Funding ', ' Pathologist ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' transplant patient ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Hour ', ' Severities ', ' Slide ', ' Techniques ', ' Country ', ' Allografting ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Surgeon ', ' Transplant Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' rapid method ', ' rapid technique ', ' Provider ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Instruction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' implantation ', ' transplant registry ', ' task analysis ', ' graft function ', ' clinical practice ', ' data registry ', ' clinical investigation ', ' prognostic value ', ' prognostic ability ', ' prognostic power ', ' prognostic utility ', ' adaptive learning ', ' clinical biomarkers ', ' clinically useful biomarkers ', ' prognostic significance ', ' transplant centers ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' kidney biopsy ', ' renal biopsy ', ' post-transplant ', ' post-transplantation ', ' posttransplant ', ' posttransplantation ', ' Transplantation Surgery ', ' advanced analytics ', ' ']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F32,2021,86458,MD-07
"Medical Image Perception Society XIX Conference MIPS XIX brings together an international community of experts from different fields including radiologists, pathologists, other image-based clinicians, psychologists, statisticians, physicists, engineers, and computer scientists, all investigating the extraction of diagnostic information from medical images. The meeting forges research and learning opportunities for new trainees and young researchers in a dedicated multidisciplinary forum unmatched by other meetings. MIPS XIX is being organized by the Medical Image Perception Society (a US-based society; Elizabeth Krupinski, PhD President) in conjunction with local hosts Karla Evans, PhD (University of York Psychology) and Mark McEntee, PhD (University College Cork Clinical Therapies); and committee (University of York) trainee member Emma Raat. It will run July 19-21, 2021 at the Novatel York Centre located near the University of York campus. Nine topic areas have been selected for MIPS XIX, reflecting important dimensions of medical image interpretation. This year’s special focus themes are 1) Improving Diagnostic & Screening Performance (or outcomes) in Radiology Using Human & Machine Expertise and 2) Technological & Human Interventions for Enhancing Medical Image Perception. Studying how clinicians extract diagnostic information from images identifies the causes of missed diagnoses and ways to eliminate these errors. Careful design and evaluation of imaging systems are critical in view of their enormous costs. With the current emphasis in the practice of medicine on “meaningful use” and “accountable care” to improve the quality, safety, and efficiency of care, the role the clinician as decision-maker cannot be ignored. Medical image perception research develops and applies modern methods to the evaluation of observer performance in diagnostic imaging tasks. Understanding basic aspects of the perception of medical images can reduce diagnostic error and improve medical decision-making quality. This grant will support 10 students to attend and present their research at MIPS XIX. To date, 122 students have been awarded scholarships. The primary goal in supporting these students is to create opportunities and offer supportive mentoring at this formative stage in the trainee’s career to enhance their research potential and likelihood of success. The meeting brings together diverse researchers investigating the process of extracting diagnostic information from medical images to render accurate and efficient diagnostic decisions. Opportunities for advanced, interdisciplinary training of young scientists interested in medical image perception research and its relevance to disease prevention and treatment are often quite limited at the university level. Since 1997, 122 trainees have been awarded MIPS scholarships, having a significant impact on the field by creating opportunities and offering supportive mentoring at this formative stage in the trainee’s career to enhance their research potential and likelihood of success as independent basic science and clinician-scientist researchers.",Medical Image Perception Society XIX Conference,10235401,R13EB031602,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic Errors ', ' diagnosis errors ', ' Diagnostic Imaging ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Engineering ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Judgment ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Malpractice ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Ophthalmology ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', "" Physician's Role "", ' Physicians ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychology ', ' Psychophysics ', ' psychophysical ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Safety ', ' Scholarship ', ' Societies ', ' statistics ', ' Students ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Diagnostic radiologic examination ', ' Conventional X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic Radiology ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray Radiology ', ' Radiography ', ' Roentgenography ', ' X-Ray Imaging ', ' X-Ray Medical Imaging ', ' Xray imaging ', ' Xray medical imaging ', ' conventional Xray ', ' diagnostic Xray ', ' diagnostic Xray radiology ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' Telemedicine ', ' base ', ' career ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Modern Medicine ', ' radiologist ', ' Pathologist ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Medical Mistakes ', ' Medical Errors ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Pattern ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' American ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' member ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' bio-imaging ', ' biomedical imaging ', ' bioimaging ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' car accident ', ' automobile accident ', ' Detection ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' International ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' clinical practice ', ' imaging system ', ' diagnostic screening ', ' whole slide imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' diagnostic technologies ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NIBIB,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R13,2021,10000,GA-05
"Machine Learning for Integrative Modeling of the Immune System in Clinical Settings Machine Learning for Integrative Modeling of the Immune System in Clinical Settings In response to an immunological challenge, immune cells act in concert forming complex and dense networks. A deep understanding of these immune responses is often the first step in developing immune therapies and diagnostic tests. Multivariate modeling algorithms can simultaneously consider all measured aspects of the immune system but requires prohibitively larger cohort sizes as technological advancements increase the number of measurements (a.k.a., “Curse of Dimensionality”). To address this, we propose a series of studies to develop machine learning algorithms for comprehensive profiling of the immune system in clinical settings. Particularly, for analysis of the immune system at a single-cell-level, we will leverage the stochastic nature of clustering algorithms to produce a robust pipeline for prediction of clinical outcomes. Next, we introduce the immunological Elastic-Net (iEN) algorithm, which addresses both the curse of dimensionality and reproducibility by integrating prior immunological knowledge into the models.  The cellular systems that govern immunity act through symbiotic interactions with multiple interconnected biological systems. The simultaneous interrogation of these systems with suitable technologies can reveal otherwise unrecognized crosstalk. In collaboration with several leading laboratories, we have produced multiomics datasets (including analysis the genome, proteome, microbiome, and metabolome) in synchronized groups of patients. Using these coordinated datasets, we will evaluate several algorithms for combining multiple biological modalities while accounting for the intrinsic characteristics of each assay, to reveal biological cross- talk across various systems and increase combined predictive power. Importantly, numerous population- level factors (including medical history, environmental, and socioeconomic factors) significantly impact the immune system and studies focused on homogenous patient populations often lack generalizability to other populations. To address this, we will develop machine learning strategies to integrate population-level factors directly into our immunological data. These models will objectively define subpopulations of patients and enable flexibility in the coefficients of the models (and hence, the importance of the various biological measurements) in each group.  This research program will be executed using data from several biorepositories focused on various diseases. This approach will ensure generalizability of our work to previously unseen datasets and increase the long-term impact of our findings. Throughout the proposal, a major area of focus is the development of visualization and model-reduction strategies that lay the foundation for interpretation of complex models. The machine learning algorithms developed will be readily applicable to a broad range of multiomics and multicohort studies and will be available as open-source software. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent technological advances have enabled the production of large immune monitoring datasets, providing an opportunity for systems-level efforts to harness the power of the immune system in developing immune therapies and diagnostic tests. In this project, we will develop machine learning algorithms for analysis of the immune system at a single-cell level, in a multiomics setting integrated with various other biological measurements, and subject to adjustments based on population-level factors. This work will provide a strong quantitative bridge between large-scale epidemiologic trends and deep biological profiling to investigate the complex mechanisms that govern the immune system in clinical settings.",Machine Learning for Integrative Modeling of the Immune System in Clinical Settings,10433729,R35GM138353,"['Accounting ', ' Algorithms ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Foundations ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Immunity ', ' Immunotherapy ', ' Immune mediated therapy ', ' Immunologically Directed Therapy ', ' immune therapeutic approach ', ' immune therapeutic interventions ', ' immune therapeutic regimens ', ' immune therapeutic strategy ', ' immune therapy ', ' immune-based therapies ', ' immune-based treatments ', ' immuno therapy ', ' Laboratories ', ' Immunologic Monitoring ', ' Immune Monitoring ', ' Immunological Monitoring ', ' Immunomonitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Production ', ' Research ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' socio-economic factors ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Measurement ', ' Immunological Models ', ' Immunologic Model ', ' Medical History ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' cohort ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Modality ', ' Proteome ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Immunologics ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologically ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' microbiome ', ' Population ', ' open source ', ' patient population ', ' biological systems ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' genome analysis ', ' Algorithmic Analysis ', ' Algorithmic Analyses ', ' Analyses of Algorithms ', ' Analysis of Algorithms ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' metabolome ', ' metabonome ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' Epidemiological trend ', ' Epidemiologic trend ', ' Epidemiology trend ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' Visualization ', ' Immunodiagnostics ', ' immunological diagnostics ', ' ']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,96085,CA-18

Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop effective AI/ML readiness for HABLE and other NIH-funded data-sharing projects. This proposal will focus on three critical and common areas to improve the AI/ML-readiness of data generated from our parent HABLE project: missing data imputation, feature selection and outlier removal, and data readiness report. We will address the following three specific aims: Aim 1) Develop a Machine Learning Based Multiple Imputation Method for Handling Missing Data; Aim 2) Develop a Recursive Feature Elimination and Cross-Validation (RFE-CV) Algorithm for Feature Selection and Outlier removal, and Aim 3) Develop an Integrated Tool to Report Data Readiness. The algorithms and tools from this application will be the first of their kind to report data readiness for NIH data- sharing projects to facilitate heterogeneous data and feature engineering for AI/ML. It will make data scientists improve their AI/ML modeling more effectively and effortlessly. The administrative supplement project will benefit not only the parent HABLE project but also all other NIH-funded data-sharing projects. We expect that with the development of the algorithms and tools we will complete high data readiness in the HABLE project, which will eventually make HABLE more innovative in developing state of the art methods for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) clinical trials, leading to the development of effective personalized treatments which slow the progression of, and prevent, AD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Effective AI/ML readiness is critical for data mining, modeling, and prediction in HABLE and other NIH-funded data-sharing projects. This research project will develop algorithms and tools to improve the AI/ML-readiness of data generated from NIH-funded research from three areas: missing data imputation, feature selection and outlier removal, and data readiness report. The algorithms and tools proposed herein will make the AI/ML endeavors of data scientists more efficient, productive, and successful.",Administrative Supplement: Improving AI/ML-Readiness of data generated from HALBE or other NIH-funded research,10415363,R01AG058533,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Engineering ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Laboratories ', ' Linear Models ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Parents ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Latino ', ' Lasso ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Ensure ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' System ', ' Performance ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' drug discovery ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Address ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' aging brain ', ' aged brain ', ' tool development ', ' parent project ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' Algorithmic Software ', ' Algorithmic Tools ', ' Software Algorithm ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', "" Alzheimer's disease pathology "", ' AD pathology ', "" Alzheimer's pathology "", ' biomarker identification ', ' marker identification ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' genetic condition ', ' genetic disorder ', ' random forest ', ' Data Scientist ', ' heterogenous data ', ' data heterogeneity ', ' data set heterogeneity ', ' dataset heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous data ', ' heterogeneous data sets ', ' heterogeneous datasets ', ' heterogenous data sets ', ' heterogenous datasets ', ' algorithm development ', ' feature selection ', ' support vector machine ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', "" Alzheimer's disease diagnosis "", "" Alzheimer's diagnosis "", ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR,R01,2021,142142,TX-12
"Molecular Basis of Hair Cell Stereocilia Bundle Morphology Project Summary: The sensory cells of the inner ear, the hair cells, carry a bundle of precisely organized stereocilia bundles on their surface. Stereocilia are microvilli-like protrusions detecting sub-nanometer vibrations enabling our perception of sound. This incredible sensitivity requires an ensemble of proteins, some of which form mechanical linkages at the surface of stereocilia. These linkages have long been visualized with electron microscopy, however, the specific function of some remain elusive. This proposal focuses on a specific novel protein, Polycystic Kidney and Hepatic Disease 1-Like 1 (PKHD1L1), which is thought to be a major component of the stereocilia surface coat and is hypothesized to facilitate stereocilia bundle cohesion. To understand the spatiotemporal distribution of the protein throughout development, as well as the mechanism by which it causes deafness when mutated, multiple high-resolution light and electron microscopy experiments using different imaging modalities are being performed, resulting in a plethora of 2D and 3D images containing a wealth of data which unfortunately are costly to analyze in their entirety. Often generated to answer one question, such data sets could be shared with the scientific community for other groups to reuse for their research needs. As data collection becomes increasingly more expensive and time consuming, more groups join in sharing their raw data sets with the scientific community, in various formats often unsuitable for easy analysis. Advances in machine learning for computer vision has made it feasible to automate these manual analysis tasks, however the development of such models is heavily bottlenecked by the availability of training data which has been properly prepared and annotated. This supplemental proposal aims to increase the availability of such training data by annotating and depositing a wealth of imaging data in such a way that they may be readily used for the training of machine learning models. We will annotate three types of imaging data we collect from wild-type and ko mice to study the role of PKHD1L1 in hair cells: 1) cochlear hair cells on 3D confocal Z-stacks, 2) hair cell stereocilia and mitochondria in our 3D focused ion beam scanning electron micrograph volumes, and finally 3) stereocilia (in 2D) on our scanning electron micrographs of cochlear hair cell bundles. These annotations will be evaluated by our collaborators specializing in machine learning volumetric image segmentation to help us assess data biases, assess generalizability of our data annotation, and demonstrate the usability of the data in AI/ML applications through mini-AI/ML applications as a proof of concept. A special attention will be given to documenting our data and demonstrating their usability by retraining open-source machine learning algorithms both, with the help of our collaborators, and in-house. The data, annotations, documentation, and example use cases will be publicly hosted in open repositories. There is currently a dearth of machine learning work in the hearing field. By publicly releasing machine learning ready image data, our work will encourage the development of models that have the potential to dramatically increase the efficiency and throughput of future image analysis. Project Narrative – Public Health Relevance The goal of this study is to understand the function of Polycystic Kidney and Hepatic Disease 1-Like 1 (PKHD1L1), a novel hearing loss protein with no previous implications in hearing function. We show that absence of PKHD1L1 from the mouse inner ear sensory cells leads to a hearing loss, and understanding the mechanisms by which PKHD1L1-deficient mice develop a hearing loss is the central aim of this project. Identification and characterization of new hearing loss genes enhances the diagnostic potential for undiagnosed hereditary deafness cases in humans, and serves a foundation for developing candidate-based hearing restoration therapies.",Molecular Basis of Hair Cell Stereocilia Bundle Morphology,10410746,R01DC017166,"['Adhesions ', ' Affect ', ' Attention ', ' Auditory Perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' sound perception ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cadherins ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Charge ', ' Cochlea ', ' Cochlear Organ ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Dental crowns ', ' Crowns ', ' Data Collection ', ' deafness ', ' Electrons ', ' Negative Beta Particle ', ' Negatrons ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Fluorescence ', ' Fluorescent Antibody Technique ', "" Coon's Technic "", "" Coon's Technique "", ' Fluorescent Antibody Technic ', ' Fluorescent Antinuclear Antibody Test ', ' Immunofluorescence Technic ', ' Immunofluorescence Technique ', ' fluorescent antibody ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Hair ', ' Hair Cells ', ' Corti Cell ', ' ear hair cell ', ' Hearing ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Interferometry ', ' Ions ', ' Polycystic Kidney Diseases ', ' Polycystic Kidney ', ' Labyrinth ', ' Internal Ear ', ' inner ear ', ' Liver diseases ', ' Hepatic Disorder ', ' hepatic disease ', ' hepatopathy ', ' liver disorder ', ' Manuals ', ' Membrane Fusion ', ' Membrane Proteins ', ' Membrane Protein Gene ', ' Membrane-Associated Proteins ', ' Surface Proteins ', ' Electron Microscopy ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Motion ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' tectorial membrane ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' crosslink ', ' cross-link ', ' Label ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Site ', ' Surface ', ' repaired ', ' repair ', ' Vestibular Hair Cells ', ' Equilibrium Hair Cell ', ' Knockout Mice ', ' KO mice ', ' Knock-out Mice ', ' Null Mouse ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Morphology ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' light microscopy ', ' nano meter ', ' nanometer ', ' Scanning ', ' Slide ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' vibration ', ' Height ', ' extracellular ', ' cohesion ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' protein distribution ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Documentation ', ' model development ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' 3-D Images ', ' 3-D image ', ' 3D image ', ' 3D images ', ' Three-Dimensional Image ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Hearing Loss ', ' Hypoacuses ', ' Hypoacusis ', ' dysfunctional hearing ', ' hearing defect ', ' hearing deficit ', ' hearing difficulty ', ' hearing disability ', ' hearing dysfunction ', ' hearing impairment ', ' Data ', ' Mutate ', ' Resolution ', ' Transmembrane Domain ', ' TM Domain ', ' Transmembrane Region ', ' Wild Type Mouse ', ' wildtype mouse ', ' Molecular ', ' cellular microvillus ', ' Microvilli ', ' Microvillus ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' Consumption ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' open source ', ' task analysis ', ' usability ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' public health relevance ', ' Secure ', ' mechanotransduction ', ' mechanosensing ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' hearing restoration ', ' restore hearing ', ' genetic deafness ', ' hereditary deafness ', ' inherited deafness ', ' ']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY,R01,2021,306359,MA-08
"Development of an Open-Source and Data-Driven Modeling Platform to Monitor and Forecast Disease Activity PROJECT SUMMARY Reliable and real-time municipality-level predictive modeling and forecasts of infectious disease activity have the potential to transform the way public health decision-makers design interventions such as information campaigns, preemptive/reactive vaccinations, and vector control, in the presence of health threats across the world. While the links between disease activity and factors such as: human mobility, climate and environmental factors, socio-economic determinants, and social media activity have long been known in the epidemic literature, few efforts have focused on the evident need of developing an open-source platform capable of leveraging multiple data sources, factors, and disparate modeling methodologies, across a large and heterogeneous nation to monitor and forecast disease transmission, over four geographic scales (nation, state, city, and municipal). The overall goal of this project is to develop such a platform. Our long-term goal is to investigate effective ways to incorporate the findings from multiple disparate studies on disease dynamics around the globe with local and global factors such as weather conditions, socio- economic status, satellite imagery and online human behavior, to develop an operational, robust, and real- time data-driven disease forecasting platform. The objective of this grant is to leverage the expertise of three complementary scientific research teams and a wealth of information from a diverse array of data sources to build a modeling platform capable of combining information to produce real-time short term disease forecasts at the local level. As part of this, we will evaluate the predictive power of disparate data streams and modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease at multiple geographic scales--nation, state, city, and municipality--using Brazil as a test case. Additionally, we will use machine learning and mechanistic models to understand disease dynamics at multiple spatial scales, across a heterogeneous country such as Brazil. Our specific aims will (1) Assess the utility of individual data streams and modeling techniques for disease forecasting; (2) Fuse modeling techniques and data streams to improve accuracy and robustness at the four spatial scales; (3) Characterize the basic computational infrastructure necessary to build an operational disease forecasting platform; and (4) Validate our approach in a real-world setting. This contribution is significant because It will advance our scientific knowledge on the accuracy and limitations of disparate data streams and multiple modeling approaches when used to forecast disease transmission. Our efforts will help produce operational and systematic disease forecasts at a local level (city- and municipality-level). Moreover, we aim at building a new open-source computational platform for the epidemiological community to use as a knowledge discovery tool. Finally, we aim at developing this platform under the guidance of a Subject Matter Expert (SME) panel comprising of WHO, CDC, academics, and local and federal stakeholders within Brazil. The proposed approach is innovative because few efforts have focused on developing an open-source computational platform capable of combining disparate data sources and drivers, across a heterogeneous and large nation, into multiple modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease transmission, over multiple geographic scales.. In addition, we propose to investigate how to best combine modeling approaches that have, to this date, been developed and interpreted independently, namely, traditional epidemiological mechanistic models and novel machine-learning predictive models, in order to produce accurate and robust real-time disease activity estimates and forecasts. Project Narrative The proposed research is of crucial importance to public health surveillance and preparedness communities because it seeks to identify effective ways to utilize previously disconnected results, that have pointed out links between disease spread and factors such as socio-economic status, local weather conditions, human mobility, social media activity, to build an open-source and data driven, modeling platform capable of extracting and disseminating information from disparate data sources, and complementary modeling approaches, to (1) Evaluate the predictive power of disparate data streams and modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease at multiple geographic scales: nation, state, city, and municipality; (2) Fuse complementary modeling approaches that have been developed independently and oftentimes not used in conjunction; (3) produce real- time and short term forecasts of disease activity in multiple geographic scales across a heterogeneous and large nation like Brazil.",Development of an Open-Source and Data-Driven Modeling Platform to Monitor and Forecast Disease Activity,10244988,R01GM130668,"['Transmission ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Vector-transmitted infectious disease ', ' Vector-borne disease ', ' Vector-borne infectious disease ', ' Vector-transmitted disease ', ' vector-borne illness ', ' vectorborne disease ', ' vectorborne illness ', ' vectorborne infectious disease ', ' vector control ', ' time use ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' digital ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' pathogen ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' flu ', ' open source ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' computer infrastructure ', ' computational infrastructure ', ' Knowledge Discovery ', ' mathematical methods ', ' math methodology ', ' math methods ', ' mathematical approach ', ' mathematical methodology ', ' mathematics approach ', ' mathematics methodology ', ' mathematics methods ', ' climate variability ', ' climatic variability ', ' social media ', ' open data ', ' open science ', ' open-source data ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' Twitter ', ' computational platform ', ' computing platform ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' economic determinant ', ' vector-borne ', ' vectorborne ', ' pathogen genomics ', ' heterogenous data ', ' data heterogeneity ', ' data set heterogeneity ', ' dataset heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous data ', ' heterogeneous data sets ', ' heterogeneous datasets ', ' heterogenous data sets ', ' heterogenous datasets ', ' multiple data sources ', ' data infrastructure ', ' ZIKA ', ' data streams ', ' economic disparity ', ' meteorological data ', ' weather data ', ' Beds ', ' Behavior ', ' Brazil ', ' Burn injury ', ' Burns ', ' burned ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' chikungunya ', ' Cities ', ' Climate ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Data Sources ', ' Dengue ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' developing country ', ' developing nation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Influenza ', ' Grippe ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Population Surveillance ', ' Public Health Surveillance ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vaccination ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Weather ', ' Work ', ' Assimilations ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' spreading factor ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' disease transmission ', ' communicable disease transmission ', ' infectious disease transmission ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Techniques ', ' Country ', ' experience ', ' Municipalities ', ' high-end computing ', ' High Performance Computing ', ' novel ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Influenza B ', ' Influenza Viruses Type B ', ' Orthomyxoviruses Type B ', ' Influenza B Virus ', ' Institution ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' transmission process ', ' ']",NIGMS,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,364519,MA-07
"ADAR-editing landscape dysregulation in neuropsychiatric disorders Project Abstract:  Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) editing plays a major role in shaping transcriptome diversity by creating variant isoforms that enable fine-tuning of calcium-mediated excitatory and other signaling needed for brain development, neural plasticity and mood regulation. The spatio-temporal ADAR editing landscapes are tightly regulated by controlling ADAR expression levels to preserve preferential binding and editing. Previous studies have shown that activation of the interferon pathways of the innate immune system – such as those seen in viral infections - leads to increased expression of ADAR1p150, which ultimately results in changes to ADAR editing patterns. Furthermore, common side effects to innate immune activation by interferon alpha therapies include increased risk of depression and suicide. The changes in spatio-temporal regulation of editing patterns can lead to a wide spectrum of neurological symptoms, including neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., decreased ADAR editing in the serotonin receptor subunit2C in the prefrontal cortex observed in individuals who commit suicide). Yet, our understanding of ADAR editing landscapes remain cursory. Advances in high throughput RNA-seq enable more accurate variant calling from the sequencing reads, providing a way to map ADAR editing patterns in the transcriptome. However, there are no computational pipelines focused on ADAR editing that are easy to use, are reproducible and can handle large scale analysis. I have recently built a pipeline to handle meta-analysis of RNA-seq data that incorporates variant calling steps, but further work is needed to validate this tool to assure accuracy and reproducibility of results. It can then be used to map the spatio-temporal variation of ADAR editing landscapes. The proposed project will study ADAR editing landscapes in the following ways: (i) new computational pipelines will be benchmarked to use variant calling with RNA-seq datasets using simulated reads, (ii) ADAR editing landscape diversity in the publicly available human samples will be mapped; the computational predictions and hypotheses generated from the pipeline will be validated using (iii) measuring calcium flux in cells with known differential ADAR editing landscapes caused by PolyI:C (viral infection mimic) treatment. The proposed work will yield a validated pipeline capable of mapping ADAR editing landscapes with machine learning algorithms. Defining ADAR editing landscapes is paramount to biomarker discovery and can influence precision medicine applications in diagnosis and treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. This project will allow for me to gain the knowledge base necessary to become an independent researcher with a unique skill set of both computational and benchwork methods to advance the field of neuroscience. Project Narrative Inferring ADAR editing landscapes and their link with ion homeostasis and excitatory signaling in the brain is important for understanding, diagnosing or staging neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder and suicide. This proposed project will develop and validate computational tools to use RNA-seq from publicly available datasets for ADAR editing inferences and to delineate patterns of editing changes in cells experiencing viral infections. Overall, this project will give me the training to build my unique skill set of both computational and experimental methods that will enable me as an independent researcher to bridge the gap between bioinformatics and experimental researchers and translate my findings into precision medicine.",ADAR-editing landscape dysregulation in neuropsychiatric disorders,10238770,F31MH123131,"['Accounting ',

"A single cell view of the spatiotemporal nitrogen response in roots Project Summary/Abstract: This proposal seeks to investigate the mechanisms that mediate nutrient control of lateral root (LR) development by exploiting new single-cell expression data. The ultimate goal is to develop plants with enhanced nitrogen (N)-uptake and N-use-efficiency (NUE). This would help ameliorate the application of excess N-fertilizer - a main cause of water and air pollution that negatively impacts human health. Plant roots can sense levels of nitrate in the soil, which induces LR foraging for nutrients. LRs initiate post-embryonically from differentiated cells in the pericycle layer of the root, which de-differentiate to form “founder cells” that give rise to the post-embryonic LRs meristems. Thus, LRs are vital for root developmental plasticity and nutrient acquisition. Previous studies using GFP-marked cell lines, found that N-responses in roots are cell-type specific. However, those studies lacked the single-cell resolution and time-component necessary to identify the N- regulation of transitional states of cell-types (i.e. pericycle-to-founder cell). This proposal aims to: i) use single- cell N-response time-series data to create developmental trajectories that model the transition from pericycle-to- founder cells and ii) identify/validate TFs that regulate LR initiation in response to N-sensing. To do this, single- cell N-response transcriptome data will be analyzed from N-treated Arabidopsis thaliana roots (Aim 1). To determine the TFàtarget gene relationships in this dataset, cell-specific N-response data will be used to learn gene regulatory networks (GRNs) using a time-based machine learning algorithm called OutPredict. Next, the predicted TFàtarget gene interactions in the GRN will be validated using TARGET, a root cell-based TF perturbation assay (Aim 2). Finally, the function of candidate TFs in N-regulation of LR development and N- uptake will be validated in planta using TF mutants in phenotyping assays (Aim 3). In a preliminary in silico analysis of the outlined approach applied to existing single-cell data from Arabidopsis roots, intersected with N- responsive transcriptome data from whole roots identified: 1. A founder cell pseudotime trajectory and N- responsive TFs (Aim 1), 2. A founder cell N-response GRN that predicts TFàtarget gene interactions, and 3. A preliminary list of N-response TFs from founder cell trajectories (Table 2). These preliminary TFs will be phenotyped for their role in N-responsive LR development and 15N-uptake (Aim 3). This proposal will be the first to collect single-cell N-response data in planta and model LR development using developmental trajectory approaches. This proposal also provides new computational training in single cell-data analysis and machine learning methods for GRN to the PI, which will complement her experimental skills-set in plant molecular biology, and provide her with a multi-faceted research foundation for a career as an independent researcher. This project will also benefit from a sponsor environment with proven success for providing new training to the PI, as well as, the ideal laboratory and collaborator environment for the for the proposed single-cell and network modeling experiments. Project Narrative: The developmental plasticity of plants is enabled by their ability to change their root architecture post- embryonically, to acquire water and nutrients in a changing soil environment. This study specifically aims to identify the mechanisms by which nitrogen initiates the development of post-embryonic meristems in lateral roots. These studies will be used to guide strategies for generating crops that have enhanced lateral root growth and are more efficient at taking up nitrogen in the soil, to reduce the excess application of nitrogen-based fertilizes that negatively impact the environment and human health.",A single cell view of the spatiotemporal nitrogen response in roots,10235451,F32GM139299,"['Air Pollution ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Auxins ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cell division ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Environment ', ' Fertilizers ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Hazardous Chemicals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Nitrates ', ' NO3- ', ' nitrate ', ' Nitrogen ', ' Phenotype ', ' Plant Growth Regulators ', ' Phytohormones ', ' Plant Hormones ', ' Plants ', ' Reaction Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Response Time ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Soil ', ' Time ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Water Pollution ', ' Generations ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Mouse-ear Cress ', ' Arabidopsis thaliana ', ' Arabidopsis ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Meristem ', ' uptake ', ' Knowledge ', ' cell type ', ' gene interaction ', ' mutant ', ' single cell analysis ', ' success ', ' Nutrient ', ' skills ', ' Regulation ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' time use ', ' comparative ', ' network models ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' overexpression ', ' overexpress ', ' developmental plasticity ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' overtreatment ', ' over-treatment ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' in silico ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,F32,2021,68562,NY-12

"Learning about the evolution of structural variations from genomic and transcriptomic data PROJECT SUMMARY Structural variations are key drivers of both evolutionary adaptation and human disease. My group develops and applies computational and statistical approaches for understanding the evolution of structural variations from patterns in their genomic and transcriptomic data. During the past few years, our studies have focused primarily on gene duplication, which represents the most common type of structural variation observed in nature. In particular, we investigated the origins of evolutionary innovation after gene duplication, a problem of long- standing interest in the evolutionary genomics community. To answer this question, we designed the first method for classifying evolutionary outcomes of duplicate genes from phylogenetic comparisons of their gene expression profiles. By applying this decision tree method to multi-tissue gene expression data, we were able to classify evolutionary outcomes of duplicate genes in Drosophila, mammals, and grasses. These studies revealed frequent tissue-specific expression divergence after duplication, as well as sequence and expression differences within and among taxa that are consistent with natural selection. In a follow-up population-genomic analysis, we demonstrated that natural selection indeed plays an important role in the evolutionary outcomes of young duplicate genes in Drosophila. Later, we developed analogous decision tree classifiers for two additional types of structural variations: gene deletion and translocation. Applications of our methods to sequence and expression data from multiple tissues and developmental stages in Drosophila uncovered rapid divergence concordant with adaptation, suggesting that natural selection shapes the evolutionary trajectories of structural variations generated by deletion and translocation as well. However, our recent analyses revealed that there are many limitations of these decision tree methods, including sensitivity to gene expression stochasticity, lack of statistical support, and inability to predict parameters driving the evolution of structural variations. Thus, during the next five years, my group will develop a suite of tailored model-based statistical and machine learning approaches for classifying the evolutionary outcomes and predicting the evolutionary parameters of structural variations arising from duplication, deletion, inversion, and translocation events. Our preliminary studies indicate that these techniques will be much more powerful and accurate than previous approaches, and will therefore compose major advancements in evolutionary investigations of structural variations. In addition to implementing our methods in open source software packages, we will apply them to assay the evolutionary implications of different types of structural variations in humans and several other animal and plant taxa. Comparisons will be made among different types of structural variations, their evolutionary outcomes, and taxonomic groups. The major goal of these studies will be to ascertain the general rules by which different types of structural variation contribute to evolutionary innovation. Together, these studies will shed light on how gene duplication, deletion, inversion, and translocation work in concert to generate a diversity of complex adaptations across the tree of life. PROJECT NARRATIVE Just like a population of organisms, genome size and composition can change over time via births, deaths, and migrations of large DNA segments. These mutation events result in genomic structural variations among individuals that underlie many important human adaptations, such as color vision, and diseases, such as cancer.

"MIND-the-SKIN Project: Multi-functional Innovative Digital Toolkit for the Skin Diseases in LMICs and Beyond MIND-the-SKIN Project: Multi-functional Innovative Digital Toolkit for the Skin Diseases in LMICs and Beyond  The prevalence of skin diseases is extremely high in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in children. If left untreated, some have debilitating lifelong physical disabilities and deformities, as well as social and mental effects. Among them are skin infections which are listed as members of the Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) by the World Health Organization and targeted for disease control globally. Many of the NTDs, including leprosy, Buruli ulcers, yaws, and lymphatic filariasis, are co-endemic in West Africa. Early detection and treatment is currently the most effective measures for their disease control. However, this is hampered by a paucity of skilled healthcare workers in the remote areas of the LMICs where they prevail. On the other hand, diagnosis of these conditions can be done with patient history and simple skin examination, without undergoing invasive examinations requiring special skills and equipment. This is very well suited to field settings in LMICs. With a targeted training, technology-assisted decision-support system and a telemedicine network, local healthcare workers could be leveraged to enhance the diagnosis and management of the skin conditions. This project proposes to do so through development and validation of an mHealth tool for skin diseases in LMICs: the ‘eSkinHealth’ application. It is a portable smartphone or tablet application that could provide: a) direct diagnostic and management assistance to healthcare workers in remote setting, and through teledermatology, b) storage of longitudinal patients records for improved follow-up, and c) organization of clinical and image data of the skin. There is a general lack of good clinical photos of skin diseases on dark skin, and collection of photos made through this project could be further used for development of photo guides for wide use and future studies on dermatology of skin of color. The purpose of the proposed research is to complete development and optimization of eSkinHealth and carry out its effectiveness studies on the field. The R21 phase of the work will assess the feasibility, usability, and acceptability of the prototype, validation of a novel built-in wound scoring system, and standardization and optimization of dermatologic photography on dark skin. The R33 phase will evaluate the performance of the app on outcomes of surveillance and management of NTDs and further optimization of photo analysis of skin lesions on dark skin using the image optimization technology. The research will be carried out in a western-African country of Côte d’Ivoire. It will build on our previous work in surveillance of NTDs in rural Côte d’Ivoire and trainings to local healthcare workers, as well as our expertise in mHealth. It will leverage our multi-year collaboration with investigators from Côte d’Ivoire, application developers in Japan, and tropical medicine expertise from Tulane University. If successful, eSkinHealth will be instrumental in overcoming the current gaps and weaknesses in dermatological services in LMICs providing a breakthrough to management of skin diseases in this underserved populations, as well as contributing to the dermatology of skin of color worldwide, envisioning Skin Health for All. PROJECT NARRATIVE While the prevalence of skin diseases are very high in LMICs, especially in children, dermatological services in LMICs are lacking mainly due to lack of clinical skills, and further, ways to document and store clinical course which is important for individual patient follow-up do not exist. If there is a field-adapted platform for data collection and sharing for skin conditions allowing clinical decision support for healthcare providers onsite, and remotely through teledermatology, this could serve as a breakthrough to management of skin diseases in this underserved populations.

"Coupling a multifunctional tag to scalable endogenous tagging technology for improved genome-wide perturbation screens Project Summary  Characterizing the functions of protein-coding genes is an important goal in the post-genomic era. While proteins are the ultimate effectors of most cellular functions, including those mis-regulated in disease, we have an extremely limited understanding of the roles of the majority of proteins in the human proteome. Though powerful, existing technologies for the high-throughput interrogation of protein-coding genes, including CRISPR/Cas9-based approaches and RNA interference, require extended periods of time to effect changes in protein levels, and thus suffer two critical shortcomings. First, they are unable to detect the contribution of growth- essential genes to any cellular process other than viability, as any cell carrying a perturbation in such a gene would fail to propagate. Second, compensatory and adaptive effects have ample opportunity to manifest, thus convoluting screen results by ameliorating the effect of the perturbation, or by generating a novel, unrelated effect. To address these critical limitations, I propose to develop a new screening technology that will minimize the time between perturbation and screen readout by inducibly and rapidly degrading endogenous proteins. This is made possible by a readily scalable endogenous tagging technology that harnesses homology-independent targeted integration to insert a synthetic exon into the intron of a protein-coding gene at the site of a double strand break. The synthetic exon will encode a multifunctional ligand-binding protein that depending on the ligand, will lead to fluorescence or rapid degradation. Pooled libraries of sgRNAs targeting different introns allows for the creation of custom libraries of cells, where each cell carries this multifunctional tag on a different protein. The utility of this approach will be established aims 1 and 2 by testing (1) whether cells that have undergone rapid depletion of growth-essential proteins are maintained in the cell library at the end of the short perturbation window and (2) whether rapid depletion and CRISPR knockout at the same protein produce different effects on a well-established phenotype, due to the distorting effects of adaptation events in the knockout. Aim 3 witnesses the use of a machine learning approach and the data from thousands of attempted tagging events to identify how the features of a potential tag site dictate the likelihood that a functional protein carrying the multifunctional tag will be produced. The resulting model will be unleashed on the protein-coding genome to predict high-quality tag sites for as many protein-coding genes as possible. This will establish an improved screening paradigm that will allow for the pooled interrogation of the contributions of thousands of proteins to a phenotype of interest, will thus accelerate the rate at which we come to understand the poorly understood elements of the protein-coding genome. These efforts will be well supported by the outstanding resources for experimentation and mentorship at both the University of Pennsylvania and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, and will provide excellent training in experimental techniques for protein perturbation and characterization, as well computational literacy in the broadly useful field of machine learning. Project Narrative  Proteins are the ultimate effectors of most cellular functions in health and disease. Yet, the functions of the majority proteins encoded by the human genome are very poorly understood.

"Computational methods for optimized biologics formulation Project Summary: Protein-based biologics – therapeutics whose active ingredient is a protein and most commonly a monoclonal antibody (mAb) – make up a $200 billion/year market that is expected to double in size by 2025. A critical component in the safety and efficacy of biologics is the need to maintain the active protein during long-term storage and subsequent injection/infusion. The selection of excipients and buffers toward this end is termed “formulation.” Proper formulation of a protein-based drug is essential to stabilize the active protein from unfolding and to block sites on the folded protein that may pose an aggregation risk and lead to elevated viscosity due to undesirable protein-protein interactions (PPI). Importantly, formulation can be done without altering the sequence of (i.e. re-engineering) the protein and is thus an independent tool for bringing a biologic therapeutic to market. Current approaches to choosing an optimized formulation are either low-throughput experiments or computational methods that do not take into account the molecular details of excipient-protein interactions. The established Site Identification by Ligand Competitive Saturation (SILCS) computational platform technology maps the affinity pattern of the complete 3D surface of a protein for a wide diversity of chemical functional groups. The functional group affinity pattern is then used to determine excipients that can bind to and stabilize the active, folded conformation of a protein and bind to regions of the protein that may participate in PPI, thereby inhibiting aggregation and decreasing viscosity. The broad goal of the proposal is the continued development and validation of SILCS-Biologics as an industry-ready workflow and a graphical user interface to manage and apply the extensive information generated by SILCS excipient screening and PPI analysis. In the proposed studies experimental efforts will be undertaken to generate data for model training and validation across a variety of proteins and commonly used excipients. That data will be then combined with computed SILCS metrics including excipient binding locations and affinities and potential regions that can participate in PPI across the complete protein surface, including the impact of pH and the unique properties of Arginine as an excipient. This information will then be applied in the context of machine learning to develop models that will predict excipients that will block PPI thereby lowering viscosity and slowing aggregation as well as stabilize the folded, biologically active state of the protein. The proposed models will be validated at the University of Maryland, Baltimore and with industrial and government partners against established experimental methods on a range of proteins with various therapeutic indications. Upon successful completion of the project new offerings will be added to the existing SILCS software suite that will minimize the time and costs requirements for the formulation of biologics as well as lead to improved formulations thereby improving clinical outcomes. These capabilities will be implemented in the context of industry-ready workflows for direct sale to pharmaceutical companies and for use in contract research for the optimized formulation of biologics. Project Narrative: Biopharmaceuticals, including monoclonal antibodies, represent a growing and important area of new therapeutic agent development, but the formulation of biopharmaceuticals remains a bottleneck. Proposed is the continuation of a successful Phase 1 effort to use a rational formulation design technology using computational methods to allow screening of a large number of excipient/buffer combinations that will result in accelerated and improved biopharmaceutical development thereby facilitating bringing these agents to market as well as improving clinical outcomes.",Computational methods for optimized biologics formulation,10257518,R44GM130198,"['Adoption ', ' Monoclonal Antibodies ', ' Clinical Treatment Moab ', ' mAbs ', ' Arginine ', ' L-Arginine ', ' Baltimore ', ' Behavior ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Biological Products ', ' Biologic Products ', ' Biological Agent ', ' biopharmaceutical ', ' biotherapeutic agent ', ' Biological Response Modifier Therapy ', ' Biologic Therapy ', ' Biological Therapy ', ' biological therapeutic ', ' biological treatment ', ' biotherapeutics ', ' biotherapy ', ' Buffers ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Engineering ', ' Excipients ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Industrialization ', ' Industry ', ' Insulin ', ' Humulin R ', ' Novolin R ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Ligands ', ' Lysine ', ' L-Lysine ', ' Maps ', ' Maryland ', ' Membrane Proteins ', ' Membrane Protein Gene ', ' Membrane-Associated Proteins ', ' Surface Proteins ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' Patients ', ' Peptides ', ' Probability ', ' Protein Engineering ', ' genetic protein engineering ', ' protein design ', ' Proteins ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Sales ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Viscosity ', ' Work ', ' protein folding ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Protein Binding ', ' bound protein ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pattern ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Location ', ' injection/infusion ', ' success ', ' functional group ', ' Structure ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' protein structures ', ' proteins structure ', ' protein structure ', ' Affinity ', ' Data ', ' Protein Region ', ' Recombinants ', ' Research Contracts ', ' Validation ', ' trend ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' 3-D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3D structure ', ' graphical user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' software user interface ', ' usability ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' commercialization ', ' therapeutic development ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' FDA approved ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' phase 1 study ', ' Phase I Study ', ' screening ', ' Formulation ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' computational platform ', ' computing platform ', ' ']",NIGMS,"SILCSBIO, LLC",R44,2021,885774,MD-07
"Brain substrates for cardiovascular stress physiology Project Summary/Abstract The candidate’s long-term goal is to become an independent investigator focused on the neurophysiological pathways that link psychological stress with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Individual differences in biological responses to acute psychological stress have been shown to predict risk for subclinical and clinical markers of CVD, indicating that variation in the stress response relates to measurable health outcomes. The proposed research and career development program will position the candidate to definitively address open and mechanistic questions on cardiovascular stress physiology with a multi-dimensional approach. The overall objective of the current project is to identify the ‘brain–cardiovascular’ pathways of metabolically excessive cardiovascular responses to stress. The central hypothesis is that metabolically excessive cardiovascular responses to stress are caused by increased brain activation in areas associated with cardiovascular and autonomic control. In extension, the candidate will test whether altering brain function via neuromodulation will regulate downstream cardiovascular responses. Proposed are two independent studies. In Aim 1, we will newly examine the relationship between metabolically excessive cardiovascular and neural responses using a cross-sectional approach. In Aim 2, we will measure stressor-evoked metabolic and cardiovascular responses before and after neuromodulation in an experimental approach. Participants will engage in a novel, non-invasive neuromodulation technique, transcranial infrared laser stimulation (TILS), known to alter the brain by increasing oxygenation, and will be compared to an established control. This research plan will help the candidate develop essential skills for career development including cardiovascular and metabolic testing, machine learning and cross-validation methods for functional magnetic resonance imaging analyses, and utilizing a neuromodulation technique, TILS. The proposed Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide 5 years of training through a combination of research, classroom experiences, and mentoring to further the candidate in preparation for scientific independence. Specifically, the candidate will gain expertise in measuring metabolic activity, advance her computational neuroimaging analysis skills, become proficient in experimentally manipulating brain function, and develop necessary statistical skills. The project brings together a mentoring team of experts in their respective areas to provide the candidate with the necessary skills to continue on the trajectory to make a transformative contribution to the field of Cardiovascular Behavioral Medicine. This project will provide vital information regarding the pathways between psychological stress and CVD risk while at the same time providing training and mentoring for the candidate’s further career. PROJECT NARRATIVE Exaggerated physiological responses to psychological stress are commonly regarded as contributing to cardiovascular disease (CVD), nonetheless, we lack an understanding of the mechanisms by which psychological responses to threat are translated into cardiovascular responses that are excessive to the immediate physiological needs of the individual. The project will use both cross-sectional and experimental approaches to examine how the brain and cardiovascular system interact during psychological stress and will provide a a more comprehensive understanding of the role the brain plays in metabolically-excessive responses to stress. This research is relevant to public health because it is a crucial step in understanding how psychological stress relates to a risk factor for CVD and is necessary to develop appropriate brain- based approaches to CVD risk prevention and stratification.",Brain substrates for cardiovascular stress physiology,10225342,K01HL145021,"['Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' Behavioral Medicine ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Stem ', ' Brainstem ', ' Calibration ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cardiovascular Physiology ', ' cardiovascular function ', ' Clinical Markers ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Energy Metabolism ', ' Energy Expenditure ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Limbic System ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Oxygen Consumption ', ' Physiology ', ' Play ', ' Professional Competence ', ' career skill ', ' Program Development ', ' Public Health ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' stress response ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' career ', ' Medial ', ' Peripheral ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Metabolic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Reaction ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' skills ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Regulation ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' Neuraxis ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Brain region ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' Address ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' K01 Award ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Program ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Stratification ', ' Validation ', ' Preparation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' time use ', ' Outcome ', ' Metabolic stress ', ' Individual Differences ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' ']",NHLBI,BAYLOR UNIVERSITY,K01,2021,135053,TX-17
"Prediction of risk of disability worsening and inflammatory disease activity in MS utilizing multimodal prediction algorithms Project Summary:  Multiple sclerosis (MS) exhibits a markedly heterogeneous and unpredictable course, with a clinical spectrum ranging from very mild forms of the disease in some patients (often termed “benign MS”) to an aggressive disease course with rapid accumulation of disability in others. Furthermore, there appears to be significant inter-individual variability in the responses to the many available disease-modifying therapies (DMT). A variety of factors have been proposed to be associated with the disease course in MS, including demographics, lifestyle factors, clinical characteristics, MRI-derived measures, and elevated serum neurofilament light chain (NfL), among others. It remains unclear though if these factors are complementary or redundant in their predictive value. Moreover, there is a lack of validated tools to accurately predict, at an individual level, future inflammatory disease activity or disability worsening. This is largely due to the lack of datasets with sufficient size, breadth and representativeness. The use of electronic medical records (EMR) has dramatically increased in recent years, enabling the capture of a wide variety of data measures from large numbers of individuals. Furthermore, the development and refinement of statistical machine learning methods has revolutionized the approach to analysis of such high-dimensional datasets. This background provides a unique opportunity to leverage and analyze “big data” in order to develop clinical risk prediction algorithms and personalized medicine tools in MS.  Multiple Sclerosis Partners Advancing Technology and Health Solutions (MS PATHS) is a network of 10 MS centers that have standardized elements of their clinical practice to implement a centralized health information exchange architecture. MS PATHS was designed around the concept of a learning health system (LHS), merging research with ongoing patient care by collecting standardized clinical and imaging data during routine medical visits. As of August, 2019, >15,000 patients have opted to participate in MS PATHS. Thus, the MS PATHS network is an ideal, deeply phenotyped, “real-world”, large population of people with MS, in which clinically relevant predictive algorithms may be developed and validated.  The goal of the current project is to develop and validate multi-modal predictive algorithms of clinically relevant disease outcomes in MS. We hypothesize that integrating a wide variety of potential predictors, including demographics, clinical characteristics (including current/historical DMT use), comorbidities/lifestyle factors, MRI- derived measures and laboratory data (including serum NfL) will lead to the development and validation of algorithms that may accurately predict future clinical disability worsening and inflammatory disease activity. Furthermore, this approach will allow the assessment of the individual contribution of specific predictors to the developed predictive algorithms, and may aid with the identification of novel risk factors of disease severity in MS. Project Narrative Successful completion of this project will lead to the development and dissemination of clinically relevant predictive algorithms to enable personalized risk assessment and therapeutic decision-making in MS, provide the means to optimize selection/stratification of participants in clinical trials, and will also provide insight regarding the interactions and relative importance of putative prognostic factors in MS.",Prediction of risk of disability worsening and inflammatory disease activity in MS utilizing multimodal prediction algorithms,10224357,K23NS117883,"['Algorithms ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Award ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Counseling ', ' Decision Making ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Exhibits ', ' foot ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Manuals ', ' Multiple Sclerosis ', ' Disseminated Sclerosis ', ' insular sclerosis ', ' neurofilament ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Inflammatory ', ' tool ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' Visit ', ' processing speed ', ' Digit ', ' Digit structure ', ' Structure ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' performance tests ', ' response ', ' Contrast-Enhancing Lesion ', ' Gadolinium-Enhancing Lesion ', ' Gd-Enhancing Lesion ', ' Enhancing Lesion ', ' Health system ', ' Biostatistical Methods ', ' Data ', ' Predictive Value ', ' General Prognostic Factor ', ' Prognostic/Survival Factor ', ' Prognostic Factor ', ' Stratification ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' lifestyle factors ', ' life-style factor ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' demographics ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' clinical practice ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' clinical risk ', ' dexterity ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' clinical predictors ', ' walking speed ', ' walking pace ', ' inter-individual variation ', ' inter-individual variability ', ' interindividual variability ', ' interindividual variation ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' high dimensionality ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' disability risk ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NINDS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,170094,MD-07
"Dynamic µOCT for cellular tissue phenotyping Phenotyping cells and tissue is a critical function that spans basic science to clinical diagnosis. Yet, established methods for phenotyping cells in tissue are static, are evaluated when the tissue is dead, and typically involve destruction of the sample. This paradigm misses an entire dimension represented by cellular function and activity, information that is potentially of great significance in understanding cell/tissue state. Recently, a new field has emerged that uses coherence-gated imaging to quantify living tissue motion as a proxy of cellular function and activity. Coherence-based motility imaging is relatively new - much remains to be learned about the nature of its dynamic signal. In addition, many of the coherence-gated technologies described to date lack the resolution to investigate individual cells. The ones that are capable of seeing cells do not provide cross-sectional images and thus miss important architectural patterns associated with tissue maturation. We have developed a form of coherence-gated imaging called 1-µm optical coherence tomography (µOCT). µOCT has a resolution of 1 µm axial by 2 µm lateral, enabling cross-sectional visualization of tissue at the cellular level. Recently, we have discovered that by sequentially acquiring multiple µOCT images and computing the pixel-per-pixel power spectrum, we observe a dramatic increase in image contrast and new information emerging from the µOCT datasets. Preliminary studies with this new technology, termed dynamic µOCT (DµOCT), suggest that it can be used to visualize epithelial maturation, cell death/apoptosis, and cellular activity. In this grant, we will mature this technology by conducting key validation studies in a variety of clinically relevant human tissues, animal models, and spheroids to understand the dynamic signal and determine its accuracy for diagnosing pathology, activity, and response to therapy (apoptosis/necrosis) (Aim 1). We also will advance DµOCT further by increasing spatial and temporal resolution, creating new data mining analysis pipelines, and developing and validating technology and probes that enable DµOCT to be implemented in vivo (Aim 2). By expanding our understanding and implementation of this exciting technology, we hope to provide a powerful new tool that will have significant and wide-reaching impact in the biological and clinical sciences. In this proposal we will develop a cross-sectional imaging technology termed dynamic µOCT (DµOCT) that identifies distinct cells and tissues using intracellular motility signatures, a proxy of cell activity and state. Research will involve conducting a series of experiments in spheroids, animals, and human tissue to understand the nature of the dynamic signal and determine the diagnostic capacity of this technology for distinguishing disease, cell/tissue activity, and response to therapy. We additionally will develop next generation DµOCT technology that will increase resolution, provide more powerful diagnostic algorithms, and enable the use of DµOCT in living patients.",Dynamic µOCT

"Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) Methods and Analysis for Populations of Diverse Ancestry - Study Sites Abstract/Summary Globally, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) outrank infectious diseases in terms of public health burden. Cardiometabolic diseases (CMD) such as heart disease and stroke are the leading causes of death worldwide. In this application we will explore the genomic risk for common CMD, including hypertension, stroke, diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia and kidney disease, and related traits (including BMI, blood pressure, lipid, glucose, insulin and creatine) across populations with African ancestry (AA). There is evidence to suggest that polygenic risk scores (PRSs) translate poorly from a discovery study in one ancestral population (e.g. European Americans) to a target population (e.g. sub-Saharan Africans), especially when they are separated by large genetic differences. However, this has not been evaluated with large, well-powered AA datasets. Furthermore, the high genetic diversity and population structure among non-European Ancestry (EA) populations need to be investigated to understand the performance of PRSs in other regions populated by people with diverse genomic backgrounds. We bring together the Human Heredity and Health in Africa Consortium (H3Africa), other African, Jamaican and African American core cohorts, to develop a joint resource of over 50,000 participants with relevant phenotype and genomics data, referred to as the CARdiometabolic Disorders IN African-ancestry PopuLations (CARDINAL) Study Site. In addition, the CARDINAL Study Site will include 5 replication cohorts with >100,000 participants from diverse ancestry populations. Our main objective is to establish a Study Site for PRS Methods and Analysis for AA Populations and to collaboratively generate and refine PRS for other populations of diverse ancestry by integrating existing datasets with genomics and phenotype data for a range of complex diseases and traits. Our first aim is to integrate phenotype and genomic datasets from ~50,000 African individuals from seven individual cohort studies. Subsequently, we will evaluate PRSs and develop a novel method that takes into consideration, ancestry-specific genomic regions to improve prediction of PRSs in populations characterised by genetic sub-structure. Finally, we will develop an interactive dashboard for dissemination of PRS-related data from diverse ancestry populations. CARDINAL Study Site is ideal for generating novel biologic insights into complex disease etiology, with applications in global populations. Members of the CARDINAL team have successfully worked together for about a decade, generating and disseminating scientific knowledge through high impact publications. By establishing a Study Site in the Polygenic Risk Score Diversity Consortium, CARDINAL brings the largest cohort of African-ancestry participants to the table, to explore the genomics contribution to common CMDs and other NCDs. Narrative Cardiometabolic diseases are on the increase worldwide, contributing to high levels of morbidity and mortality, with limited resources among lower-resource populations in North America and Africa to prevent disease, make diagnosis and clinically manage patients. In this study we bring together ~50,000 African-ancestry participants (African American, Jamaicans and continental African) to form the CARDINAL study to assess and develop polygenic risk scores for cardiometabolic diseases and traits, and to develop analytic approaches for multi-ethnic cohorts leveraging the increased genetic diversity and lower linkage disequilibrium in African genomes. This research will lead to a better understanding of the transferability of polygenic risk scores from discovery to target populations of different ethnicities, informing prevention and diagnostic strategies that could contribute to the development of effective public health policies.",Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) Methods and Analysis for Populations of Diverse Ancestry -

This multimillion-dollar gift from DESRES, with NIH support, provided a unique opportunity for researchers to tackle even more groundbreaking biological questions by simulating systems as large as 700,000 atoms at a rate of multiple microseconds per day. The goal of this renewal project is to provide the national biomedical research community with continued access to this unique and powerful Anton 2 resource and to maximize the benefit of this resource to the community. Since 2010, PSC has supported 589 research projects conducted by 202 unique PIs on the Anton systems hosted at PSC. So far, these projects have resulted in 292 publications, many of which have had significant impact on their fields of research. These fields cover the entire spectrum of biomolecular processes that form the fundamental underpinnings of biology, including protein folding, ion channel selectivity and gating, membrane dynamics and organization, protein- ligand binding, and many others. Demand for Anton 2 is quite high, with 2-3x higher demand than can be met each year. Given this, our goals are focused not only on providing continued access but also on maximizing the value of this limited resource to the community—recognizing that the creativity of the broad, diverse Anton 2 research community is one of our most powerful resources for innovation. Anton 2 will be integrated as an XSEDE service provider, and the accessibility and impact of Anton 2 will significantly increase by engaging in their extensive broadening participation, outreach, and training programs. Through these outreach efforts, researchers at many more institutions will have the opportunity to use Anton 2, especially researchers from traditionally underrepresented groups in biomedical research. The hundreds of long-timescale MD trajectories researchers generate on Anton 2 constitute a unique and valuable dataset that can be used to gain additional biomedical knowledge and advance the application of machine learning protocols to augment molecular dynamics simulations. This important dataset will be available to researchers and educators worldwide through a web portal and co-located on the PSC's Bridges-2 system for classroom instruction and research, including reanalysis, machine learning, and data mining. Project Narrative The Anton 2 supercomputer made available at Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center through this award will enable researchers to simulate biomolecular systems orders of magnitude faster than any conventional supercomputer. This powerful resource will enable biomedical researchers to better understand the fundamental biomolecular processes of biology, leading to better ways to treat disease and improve quality of life.",Breakthrough Molecular Dynamics Research via an Anton2 Supercomputer,10211715,R01GM116961,"['Academy ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Education ', ' Community Education ', ' Creativeness ', ' creativity ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Ion Channel ', ' Ionic Channels ', ' Membrane Channels ', ' United States National Academy of Sciences ', ' National Academy of Sciences ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' National Research Council ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Running ', ' Science ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' protein folding ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Protein Binding ', ' bound protein ', ' Evaluation Reports ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' price lists ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' data management ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' Molecular Dynamics Simulation ', ' molecular dynamics ', ' supercomputer ', ' outreach ', ' outreach program ', ' Gifts ', ' Institution ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Data ', ' Supercomputing ', ' super computing ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Instruction ', ' cost ', ' next generation ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' data sharing ', ' Secure ', ' anxious ', ' broadening participation research ', ' Broadening Participation ', ' web portal ', ' internet portal ', ' on-line portal ', ' online portal ', ' web-based portal ', ' Data Science ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' under representation of groups ', ' under represented groups ', ' under represented populations ', ' underrepresentation of groups ', ' FAIR principles ', ' FAIR data ', ' FAIR guiding principles ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable ', ' service providers ', ' archive data ', ' archiving data ', ' archived data ', ' ']",NIGMS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,408856,PA-18
"Data-driven approaches in defining knee osteoarthritis phenotypes and factors  associated with fast progression Osteoarthritis (OA) affects 14 million individuals in the US and over 300 million adults worldwide. The disease is characterized by joint pain and functional limitations and is associated with poor health- related quality of life and increased healthcare utilization. OA of the hips and knees ranks as the 11th highest contributor to global disability. Despite the clinical and economic impact of knee OA, no disease-modifying agents are currently available; current treatments are limited to symptom control and are only modestly efficacious. While several promising treatments are in the pipeline, developing and testing treatments for OA is complicated by disease heterogeneity. We urgently need to identify the right patient for the right treatment to ensure that new therapies are being tested on the appropriate population. This proposal aims to use machine learning methods to address gaps in our understanding of disease heterogeneity in knee OA. We will use publicly available data from the FNIH OA Biomarkers Consortium project. This study of 600 subjects with knee OA includes over 200 parameters that describe the joint structure and disease severity, including measures of cartilage, bone, ligaments, menisci, and inflammation. An unsupervised learning approach using model-based clustering will be used to distinguish disease phenotypes. To implement phenotyping in practice a minimal set of biomarkers must be identified that meets the challenges of both predictive accuracy and feasibility. Thus the second aim will investigate variable selection methods in model-based clustering in order to identify important variables and develop a prediction model to determine phenotype. Finally, a supervised machine learning approach via super learning will investigate algorithms to predict disease progression. The applicant, Dr. Jamie Collins, is a biostatistician at the Orthopedic and Arthritis Center for Outcomes Research at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Dr. Collins is a committed investigator in rheumatology research with eight first author publications in the field. She holds a career development award from the Rheumatology Research Foundation and pilot funding from the Brigham Research Institute. This proposal will provide protected time and rigorous training so that the applicant can expand her current biostatistical skill set to encompass the burgeoning fields of data science and machine learning. She will take coursework at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health and will have access to courses, seminars, and training provided by the Brigham Research Institute and the Harvard Catalyst Program. The applicant will be supported by mentorship from Drs. Elena Losina and Tuhina Neogi, and input from the advisory committee of Drs. Tianxi Cai, Jeffrey Duryea, Ali Guermazi, Tina Kapur, Virginia Kraus, Katherine Liao, and Kurt Spindler. The research and training proposed in this award will address critical research gaps in our understanding of OA heterogeneity and progression. This will set Dr. Collins on the path towards independence and her long-term career objective of being an independent investigator with a focus on applying advanced analytic methods in OA research. Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic disabling disease that affects millions of people worldwide; there is an urgent need to develop effective therapies capable of providing symptom control and arresting structural progression. Developing and testing treatments for OA is complicated by disease heterogeneity. The proposed work will identify disease phenotypes in knee OA that will allow for the assessment of heterogeneity of treatment effect in clinical trials and ultimately lead to the development of

"Cerebromicrovascular rejuvenation by heterochronic blood exchange PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT  Aging-induced cerebromicrovascular endothelial dysfunction is the primary factor in impairment of neurovascular coupling (NVC) responses and dysregulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF), contributing to the genesis of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). Heterochronic blood exchange (HBE) in mice as well as bioassay experiments in cultured endothelial cells treated with sera from human patients, non-human primates and rodent models of aging provide compelling evidence that implicates non-cell autonomous mechanisms as key drivers of endothelial aging processes. Guided by analysis of vascular transcriptomic changes in heterochronic parabiont mice the objective of the proposal is to elucidate the mechanism of cerebromicrovascular rejuvenation activated by specific circulating anti-geronic factors present in young blood. The central hypothesis is that young blood rescues the age-related decline in signaling via the NAD+/SIRT1 axis and reverses circulating IGF-1 deficiency, each of which can result in vascular mitochondrial rejuvenation, attenuation of endothelial oxidative stress, improved endothelial vasodilator function and restoration of endothelial angiogenic processes. The resulting increases in CBF and NVC responses reduce ischemic loci, promoting brain health. The following aims are proposed: 1) Determine the role of the cerebromicrovascular NAD+ /SIRT1 axis in rejuvenation by HBE. The working hypothesis is that HBE rescues the age-related decline in NAD+, which rejuvenates cerebromicrovascular endothelial cells via a SIRT1-dependent pathway. It is predicted that disruption of the NAD+ /SIRT1 axis will prevent cerebrovascular rejuvenation by HBE in aged mice. 2) Determine the role of circulating IGF-1 in cerebromicrovascular rejuvenation by HBE. The working hypothesis is that HBE reverses age-related IGF-1 deficiency, which exerts multifaceted endothelial protective effects contributing to cerebromicrovascular rejuvenation by young blood. It is predicted that HBE-mediated endothelial functional and transcriptomic changes are partially prevented by disruption of IGF-1/IGFR1 signaling. 3) Determine how circulating NAD precursors and IGF-1 in young and old humans determine cerebromicrovascular endothelial function and phenotype. This will be tested by bioassaying the effects of circulating factors and integrating the results with existing endothelial function, NVC and CBF data from the serum donors. To optimize cognitive status prediction with automated machine learning we will perform association analyses of endothelial signatures with cerebrovascular and cognitive measures using linear mixed effect models. Together, the proposed studies will elucidate the involvement of two key mechanisms in the protective effects of HBE against cerebromicrovascular aging and the pathogenesis of VCID. NARRATIVE The human brain is supplied by a dense array of vessels where each neuron has its supplying capillary. Aging impairs functionally and structurally the cerebromicrovasculature and thus induces consequential neuronal dysfunction and cognitive impairment. Our recent studies using heterochronic blood exchange (HBE) in mice showed that young blood rescues the age-related decline in signaling via the NAD+/SIRT1 axis and reverses circulating IGF-1 deficiency, each of which can result in vascular mitochondrial rejuvenation, attenuation of endothelial oxidative stress, improved endothelial vasodilator function and restoration of endothelial angiogenic processes, improving brain health.",Cerebromicrovascular rejuvenation by heterochronic blood exchange,10208361,RF1AG072295,"['Abbreviations ', ' Acceleration ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Blood capillaries ', ' capillary ', ' Cerebrovascular Circulation ', ' brain blood flow ', ' cerebral blood flow ', ' cerebral circulation ', ' cerebrocirculation ', ' cerebrovascular blood flow ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Endothelium ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hyperemia ', ' Insulin-Like Growth Factor I ', ' IGF-1 ', ' IGF-I ', ' IGF-I-SmC ', ' Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1 ', ' Insulin-Like Somatomedin Peptide I ', ' Somatomedin C ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Oklahoma ', ' Oxygen ', ' O element ', ' O2 element ', ' Parabiosis ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Production ', ' Publishing ', ' Rejuvenation ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Vasodilation ', ' Vasodilatation ', ' Vasorelaxation ', ' Vasodilator Agents ', ' Vasodilating Agent ', ' Vasodilator Drugs ', ' Vasodilators ', ' Work ', ' nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase ', ' NMN pyrophosphorylase ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Reactive Oxygen Species ', ' Active Oxygen ', ' Oxygen Radicals ', ' Pro-Oxidants ', ' base ', ' density ', ' human subject ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Series ', ' Endothelial Cells ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' Cerebrum ', ' cerebral ', ' Measurement ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Attenuated ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cognitive function ', ' restoration ', ' extracellular ', ' 65+ years old ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' old age ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' attenuation ', ' Structure ', ' Nutrient ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' Consequentialism ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Rodent Model ', ' Process ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' preclinical study ', ' pre-clinical study ', ' cerebrovascular ', ' cerebral vascular ', ' cerebro-vascular ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' Expression Signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' gene expression signature ', ' transcriptional profile ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' Neuronal Dysfunction ', ' neural dysfunction ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' aged ', ' protective effect ', ' Impairment ', ' transcriptomics ', ' healthy aging ', ' endothelial dysfunction ', ' neurovascular coupling ', ' neuro-vascular coupling ', ' neurovascular ', ' neuro-vascular ', ' brain health ', ' SIRT1 gene ', ' SIRT1 ', ' Sirtuin 1 ', ' vascular cognitive impairment and dementia ', ' cardiac disease induced cognitive impairment ', ' vascular contributions to cognition/dementia ', ' vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' cost estimate ', ' cost estimation ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA HLTH SCIENCES CTR,RF1,2021,1361358,OK-05
"Therapeutic potential of vagal neurostimulation to reduce food intake Obesity affects almost 40% percent of US adults and is associated with high levels of comorbidities, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Although effective treatments with minimal side effects are lacking, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) can reduce body weight and suppress feeding behavior. There is little insight, however, into its mechanism and it is unclear whether VNS effects on feeding and body weight result from non-specific side effects, such as nausea. The current application directly addresses these issues by assessing gastrointestinal (GI) myoelectric changes as a potential mechanism for effects of VNS on feeding behavior, while comparing these responses to emetic activation. We plan to accomplish this by using a ferret model, which is a gold-standard for studying emesis, vagus nerve, and GI physiology. We will test the hypothesis that electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve can reduce food intake without triggering indicators of nausea, such as disrupted GI myoelectric responses, retching, and vomiting. We will complete three Aims. Aim 1: Define the individualized GI myoelectric patterns during feeding behavior using machine learning classification. Animals will be implanted with planar electrodes attached to the GI serosal surface from proximal gastric fundus to distal duodenum. We will use machine learning to classify GI myoelectric patterns of meal consumption compared to emetic-related states, including those elicited by intragastric emetine and high amplitude and frequency VNS known to trigger emesis. Aim 2: Test the efficacy of abdominal VNS on reducing meal size without triggering disruptions of GI myoelectric responses, retching, and emesis. Animals will be assessed for effects of abdominal VNS using a variety of stimulus parameters on feeding behavior and multi-site GI myoelectric recordings. Aim 3: Determine the efficacy of cervical VNS in controlling meal size without producing off-target effects (disruptions of GI myoelectric responses, retching, emesis, changes in heart rate, or blood pressure). We will test the impact of cervical VNS parameters on feeding behavior, GI myoelectric responses, retching, emesis, hear rate variability, and blood pressure. Our approach is innovative because we will use machine learning classification to detect individualized GI myoelectric response patterns in an awake free-moving animal for comparing therapeutic and off-target effects of VNS on feeding, GI activity, emesis, and cardiovascular function. This planned research is significant because VNS therapy can potentially provide a frontline treatment option for patients with high levels of obesity refractory to behavioral or pharmacological therapy, which unlike other surgical interventions for weight loss, such as gastric bypass, is potentially tunable and reversible by changing stimulation parameters, switching the device off, or complete removal. Obesity affects almost 40% percent of US adults, is associated with type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, and has a health-care cost that could total nearly one trillion US dollars by 2030. The current project is designed to test vagus nerve stimulation to reduce food intake, while limiting adverse effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and disrupted gastrointestinal function. Our proposed research is relevant to the NIH’s plan to support the design and testing of new interventions for achieving and maintaining a healthy weight (Strategic Plan for NIH Obesity Research).",Therapeutic potential of vagal neurostimulation to reduce food intake,10207620,R01DK121703,"['Abdomen ', ' Abdominal ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', '

"Mammary and milk microbiomes and metabolomes - Understanding early variation and impacts on risk for mammary inflammation and mastitis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Exclusive breastfeeding for at least 4 mo is considered the optimal form of nutrition for most newborns, yet many women experience substantial roadblocks in meeting this goal. One of the most common reason for  lactation cessation is mastitis (inflammation of the breast). Mastitis is also a significant concern for the US dairy industry because, not only does it represent a significant challenge to animal welfare, but it also decreases milk production and is the most common reason animals are treated with antibiotics. Despite decades of research, mastitis prevention and treatment are poorly understood in both species. One reason for this is that, although mastitis has historically been attributed to the presence of bacterial pathogens in the mammary gland, this dogma is now known to be incorrect. Modern advances in the use of DNA sequencing (rather than needing to grow bacteria in culture media) have resulted in a paradigm shift in this regard such that researchers now know that all milk produced by both healthy and mastitic cows and women contains a rich community of microbes. Experts now believe that a dysbiosis in these microbes or a shift in their metabolism causes mammary  inflammation. Consequently, we must now re-examine everything we thought we knew about the etiology and risk factors for this disease. Fundamental to filling this research gap is the rigorous characterization of the  microbiome in milk produced by healthy and mastitic women and cows; and identification of microbial community  “fingerprints” and metabolomic modifiers, thereof, that alter risk of mammary inflammation. In addition,  understanding the similarities and dissimilarities in mammary inflammation between cows and women will help  researchers understand whether the former can be used as a model for the latter (and vice versa). The overall objectives for this project are to 1) compare and contrast the milk microbiome, its functionality, immune  parameters, and inflammatory markers in healthy and mastitic women and cows, and 2) identify milk microbial  profiles and their functionality related to risk for mammary inflammation. Our central hypotheses are that  1) mammary inflammation in both species is associated with shifts in microbes and their function, concentrations of selected markers of immunity and mammary inflammation, and that 2) there exist detectable milk microbiome patterns (or functions) that predispose some women and cows to increased risk of inflammation, and these patterns are related to (and perhaps modified by) environmental and behavioral parameters, some of which are currently considered risk factors for mastitis. To test these hypotheses, we will compare healthy and mastitic cows and women (case-control design) during the first 6 wk postpartum (longitudinal, repeated-measures  design during a high-risk period in both species). Importantly, we will utilize a multi-omics approach and machine learning to understand complex relationships within and between species. The results of this work will lead to better understanding of how the microbiology of the lactating mammary gland is related to mammary  inflammation and will lay the groundwork for future studies to determine how this disease can be prevented and treated. PROJECT NARRATIVE Inflammation of the mammary gland (mastitis) is the leading cause for cessation of breastfeeding, considered the optimal form of nutrition for almost all newborns worldwide, and a major animal welfare and economic  burden for the dairy industry. Mastitis has been attributed to bacterial pathogens in the mammary gland, but new evidence demonstrates that all milk (healthy and mastitic) contains a community of microbes. Understanding the bacterial community in milk, and its function, with related host immune response will lead to a reduction in the risk of inflammation in dairy cows and women, support breastfeeding, and promote optimal health in  mothers and infants.",Mammary and milk microbiomes and metabolomes - Understanding early variation and impacts on risk for mammary inflammation and mastitis,10206210,R01HD092297,"['Affect ', ' Animal Welfare ', ' Animals ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Bacteria ', ' Breast ', ' Breast Feeding ', ' Breast fed ', ' Breastfed ', ' Breastfeeding ', ' Cattle ', ' Bovine Species ', ' bovid ', ' bovine ', ' cow ', ' Culture Media ', ' growth media ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunity ', ' Industry ', ' Infant ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Newborns ', ' newborn child ', ' newborn children ', ' Inflammation ', ' Lactation ', ' lactating ', ' lactational ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' mastitis ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methods ', ' Microbiology ', ' Milk ', ' Modernization ', ' Mothers ', ' nutrition ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' Postpartum ', ' post-partum ', ' macromolecule ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Exclusive Breastfeeding ', ' Exclusive Breast Feeding ', ' exclusively breast fed ', ' exclusively breast feeding ', ' exclusively breastfed ', ' exclusively breastfeeding ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Metabolic ', ' Inflammatory ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' meetings ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' microbial ', ' Structure ', ' offspring ', ' Prevention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' case control ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Mammary gland ', ' Gland ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Address ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' intervention for prevention ', ' prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' preventive intervention ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' microbiome ', ' protein metabolite ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' pathogenic bacteria ', ' bacteria pathogen ', ' bacterial pathogen ', ' microbial community ', ' community microbes ', ' Microbe ', ' high risk ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' inflammation marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' metabolome ', ' metabonome ', ' inflammatory milieu ', ' inflammatory environment ', ' milk production ', ' produce milk ', ' DNA sequencing ', ' DNA seq ', ' DNAseq ', ' milk microbiome ', ' dysbiosis ', ' dysbacteriosis ', ' dysbiotic ', ' microbial imbalance ', ' bacterial community ', ' mammary ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,R01,2021,443259,ID-01
"The influence of ocular remodeling on glaucoma Abstract Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, yet the reason for retinal ganglion cell damage within the optic nerve head (ONH) is not fully understood. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is considered the primary cause of glaucoma, but epidemiologic studies identify moderate or high myopia as an independent risk factor. Currently, the connection between these two diseases is unknown. We propose that there is a biomechanical basis underlying this interaction. Our central hypothesis is that scleral and ONH remodeling that leads to high myopia is one of many factors increasing the risk for subsequent pathologic ONH remodeling and glaucoma later in life. With myopia reaching epidemic proportions in portions of the world, and the prevalence of glaucoma continuing to increase, understanding the basic mechanisms underlying these disease processes is critical. We will leverage our unique tree shrew model of experimental myopia and glaucoma, a combination of in vivo and ex vivo experiments, and in silico multiscale simulation tools to examine the biomechanical basis for the link between myopia and glaucoma. The grant will focus on three primary areas of interest: 1) We will examine the ocular biomechanical changes that occur within the sclera and ONH during high myopia development in tree shrews. 2) We will determine whether scleral remodeling that leads to high myopia predisposes an animal to accelerated pathologic ONH remodeling and increased axon loss in experimental glaucoma. And, 3) We will use multiscale modeling to elucidate the interacting biomechanical mechanisms underlying glaucoma and high myopia. This knowledge will be used to develop novel targets for future glaucoma therapies. Project Narrative Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide, yet we are still trying to develop a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms that cause this disease. While we know that increased eye pressure is a risk factor for glaucoma, recent evidence also indicates moderate to high myopia is an independent risk factor. The research described in this application is aimed at investigating the link between myopia and glaucoma with the goal of identifying novel treatment options for patients with glaucoma.",The influence of ocular remodeling on glaucoma,10375895,R01EY027759,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Axon ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Calibration ', ' Communities ', ' Connective Tissue ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Epidemic ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Future ', ' Glass ', ' Glaucoma ', ' glaucomatous ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Head ', ' Physiologic Intraocular Pressure ', ' Intraocular Pressure ', ' Ocular Tension ', ' intra-ocular pressure ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Myopia ', ' Nearsightedness ', ' near vision ', ' Optic Disk ', ' Optic Nerve Head ', ' Optic Papilla ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' pressure ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Retina ', ' Retinal Ganglion Cells ', ' retinal ganglion ', ' Structure of retinal pigment epithelium ', ' Outer pigmented layer of retina ', ' Pigment cell layer of retina ', ' Pigmented layer of retina ', ' Retinal Pigment Epithelium ', ' Retinal pigment epithelial cells ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Wages ', ' Salaries ', ' Sclera ', ' White of Eye ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tupaiidae ', ' Tree Shrews ', ' Treeshrews ', ' Experimental Models ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Anterior ', ' Peripheral ', ' Area ', ' Animal Experiments ', ' Link ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Compensation ', ' Training ', ' Funding ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' exhaustion ', ' Severities ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Location ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' Cellular injury ', ' cell damage ', ' cellular damage ', ' damage to cells ', ' injury to cells ', ' cell injury ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI Scans ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' OCT2 ', ' OTF2 ', ' POU2F2 ', ' POU2F2 gene ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' preclinical study ', ' pre-clinical study ', ' reconstruction ', ' multi-scale modeling ', ' multiscale modeling ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' Implant ', ' implantation ', ' arm ', ' non-linear transformation ', ' nonlinear transformation ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' serial imaging ', ' longitudinal imaging ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' automated analysis ', ' in silico ', ' automated segmentation ', ' auto-segmentation ', ' automatic segmentation ', ' autosegmentation ', ' ']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2021,94161,AL-07
"Interpretable and extendable deep learning model for biological sequence analysis and prediction SUMMARY Single-cell sequencing technologies provide great opportunities for studying biology and medicine, but computational analyses are often the bottlenecks to reveal biological insights and define cellular heterogeneity underlying the data. The applications of machine learning (ML), especially deep learning hold great promises to address the challenges. While ML studies from various labs, including the PI’s lab, have made significant progress along this line, the involvement of the ML community in single-cell data analysis is limited due to the barriers of technology complexity and biology knowledge. To attract more ML experts into this field, the PI proposes to make large-scale single-cell sequencing data ML-ready and provide an ML-friendly development environment. Specific aims include: (1) Collect, process, and manage diverse single-cell sequencing data to make them ML-ready. We will collect single-cell sequencing data from public sources and convert them into formats efficient for storage and handling. The data will be processed with multiple options, such as imputation, normalization, and dimension reduction using a pipeline to be developed. (2) Configure the data into benchmarks. We will use the collected data to build benchmarks, gather public benchmarks, and encourage the community to submit their benchmarks. The data will be divided into training, validation, and test sets in multiple settings, including a minimum viable benchmark to assist efficient method development and a comprehensive benchmark for full evaluations. We will develop utilities to evaluate results based on a set of assessment measures, and generate detailed reports. We will select a set of public tools to run them on the benchmarks as baselines for others to compare with. (3) Provide an integrated development environment (IDE) to support partial method development. We will build an IDE for single-cell sequencing analysis method development with plug-and-play features at the code level and web interface for ML researchers to contribute and test any minimum new ideas. A report will be provided containing evaluation metrics and usage of computer resources, comparisons with some public tools, and downstream visualization and interpretation. The newly formatted data, the benchmarks, and the method development and assessment environment will be available at GitHub and the in-house single-cell data analysis web portal DeepMAPS. The proposed research is a natural extension of the parent grant (R35-GM126985), which aims to develop deep- learning algorithms, tools, web resources for analyses and predictions of biological sequences, including (1) developing general unsupervised representations and making deep-learning models interpretable for understanding biological mechanisms and generating hypotheses; (2) applying deep-learning models to a wide range of bioinformatics problems, and (3) making the data, models, and tools freely accessible to the research community. Thanks to the flexibility of the R35 mechanism, the PI’s lab extended these methods to single-cell data analyses, which well-prepared the lab for the proposed tasks. Project Narrative: Relevance to Public Health Single-cell sequencing is becoming one of the most powerful biotechnologies in studying diseases, such as cancers and Alzheimer’s disease. Machine learning can play a prominent role to better utilize single-cell sequencing data, but the involvement from the machine learning community is limited due to various technical barriers related to data complexity and development environment. Hence, in this project, we will collect and process hundreds of single-cell sequencing data sets, form benchmarks, and provide an integrated development environment to help more machine learning researchers develop methods for single-cell sequencing data analyses.",Interpretable and extendable deep learning model for biological sequence analysis and prediction,10409152,R35GM126985,"[""Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Attention ', ' Biology ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Communication ', ' Cell Interaction ', ' Cell-to-Cell Interaction ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Head ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Ohio ', ' Play ', ' Problem Formulations ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Sequence Analysis ', ' SEQ-AN ', ' Sequence Analyses ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Biological ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Source ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' data integration ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' transcriptomics ', ' web interface ', ' tool development ', ' parent grant ', ' data format ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Complex Analysis ', ' Algorithmic Software ', ' Algorithmic Tools ', ' Software Algorithm ', ' single cell sequencing ', ' ATAC-seq ', ' ATACseq ', ' learning community ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' web portal ', ' internet portal ', ' on-line portal ', ' online portal ', ' web-based portal ', ' Formulation ', ' single cell technology ', ' online resource ', ' internet resource ', ' on-line compendium ', ' on-line resource ', ' online compendium ', ' web resource ', ' web-based resource ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' analysis pipeline ', ' Multiomic Data ', ' multiple omic data ', ' Visualization ', ' data complexity ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R35,2021,234750,MO-04
"Vector Flow Velocity Imaging of Human Placenta using Angle-resolved Ultrasound and Deep Learning This proposal describes a five-year research and career development program to prepare Dr. You Li for a career as an independent investigator. The program will build upon Dr. Li’s multidisciplinary background as a biomedical engineer, trained in medical ultrasound imaging, by providing expertise in obstetrics, the application of machine learning in medical imaging, and translational research. The PI will be mentored at Stanford University by Drs. Jeremy Dahl (primary mentor, medical ultrasound), Virginia Winn (co-mentor, obstetrics and gynecology), and Matthew Lungren (co-mentor, radiology and artificial intelligence). Human placenta plays a vital role in human development, and its abnormalities may cause significant consequences to both the mother and the fetus. Preeclampsia, in particular, is a common disorder that affects approximately 1 in 33 pregnancies in the United States and accounts for 18% of pregnancy-associated maternal death. Many placental abnormalities, including preeclampsia, are related to the hemodynamics and growth of vessels in placenta. Despite the severe consequences of placental abnormalities, our understanding in placenta and placental abnormalities is lacking. One primary reason for the gap of knowledge is the inability to observe the hemodynamics of placenta in vivo. Currently, B-mode and Doppler ultrasound are the primary imaging modalities in imaging the placenta and its vasculature. However, significant limitations exist in the ability of Doppler ultrasound to visualize and measure detailed flow velocities in placental vasculature. It has low sensitivity to small vessels in the placenta, including spiral arteries and chorionic villi, and can only measure flow velocity along the ultrasound beam direction, requiring tedious manual angle correction for flow along any of the visible vessels if quantitative information is desired. These limitations make conventional Doppler ultrasound poorly suited for imaging the hemodynamics of the complex vasculature of human placenta. To provide full and detailed characterization of placental hemodynamics, we propose to develop a vector flow velocity imaging technique using deep neural network models and multiple angle plane wave ultrasound transmits. This technique will be able to quantitatively image both the flow velocity magnitudes and flow directions of millimeter-diameter vessels in human placenta over a large field of view. Aim 1 and 2 will be focused on the technical development of the technique to provide a semi- real-time vector flow imaging system based on a research ultrasound scanner, paving way for Aim 3, which will be focused on validating the clinical value of the technique on a pilot clinical study to image the hemodynamics in spiral arteries and chorionic villi of pregnant women. Successful completion of the project will provide a novel technique for the scientific and early clinical assessment of placental hemodynamics, development, and abnormalities including the development of the villous tree structure, placenta accreta, preeclampsia, and placental insufficiency. During the project, the PI will receive training in machine learning, obstetrics, translational research, and career development skills, which will transition the PI into an independent faculty. Our understanding in human placenta and its abnormalities is limited, because we do not have a medical imaging device to non-invasively observe the blood flow in the small vessels of human placenta in vivo. To fill this gap, we propose to build a semi-real-time ultrasound vector flow velocity imaging system using deep learning models to provide detailed and quantitative imaging of the flow velocity magnitudes and flow directions in human placenta. The successful completion of the project will provide a novel ultrasound imaging technology for the scientific investigation and early clinical assessment of placental development and abnormalities.",Vector Flow Velocity Imaging of Human Placenta using Angle-resolved Ultrasound and Deep Learning,10371743,K99HD105019,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Affect ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bio-engineered ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bioengineering ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Chorionic villi ', ' Placental Villi ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Faculty ', ' Fetal Growth Retardation ', ' Fetal Growth Restriction ', ' IUGR ', ' Intrauterine Growth Retardation ', ' impaired fetal growth ', ' intra-uterine growth restriction ', ' intra-uterine growth retardation ', ' intrauterine growth restriction ', ' prenatal growth disorder ', ' Fetus ', ' Future ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Gynecology ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Development ', ' Premature Labor ', ' Premature Obstetric Labor ', ' Preterm Labor ', ' Manuals ', ' Maternal Mortality ', ' maternal death ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Mentors ', ' Methodology ', ' Mothers ', ' Noise ', ' Discipline of obstetrics ', ' Obstetrics ', ' Placenta ', ' Cells Placenta-Tissue ', ' Normal Placentoma ', ' Placenta Embryonic Tissue ', ' Placentome ', ' Placenta Accreta ', ' Placenta Diseases ', ' Placenta Disorders ', ' Placental Diseases ', ' placental disorders ', ' Placental Insufficiency ', ' Placentation ', ' Placental Development ', ' Play ', ' Pre-Eclampsia ', ' EPH Gestosis ', ' Preeclampsia ', ' Pregnancy Toxemias ', ' Proteinuria-Edema-Hypertension Gestosis ', ' pregnancy toxemia/hypertension ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' expectant mother ', ' expecting mother ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' Program Development ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Trees ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Virginia ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Doppler Ultrasound ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Lateral ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Training ', ' Blood flow ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' Supersonic waves ', ' Ultrasound waves ', ' Ultrasonic wave ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' millimeter ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' fetal ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' technique development ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Data ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Device ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Spiral Artery of the Endometrium ', ' Spiral Artery ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Villous ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' vector ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Imaging technology ', ' skill acquisition ', ' skill development ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Network-based ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' imaging system ', ' tenure track ', ' tenure process ', ' Data Science ', ' human imaging ', ' early pregnancy ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' neural network architecture ', ' neural net architecture ', ' Visualization ', ' ']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,127673,CA-18
"Precision Mass Spec Imaging Based Structure-Function Signatures of Diabetic Glomerulopathy Project Summary/Abstract There are currently >450,000 patients on dialysis and ~120,000 patients will have to begin dialysis each year in the United States. Along with a marked reduction in quality of patient life, the cost to the US Medicare system is in excess of $114B per year. Therefore, there is an urgent need for developing new platforms that will enhance the drug development process for new therapies to reduce the rate of progression to end-stage kidney disease. Non-invasive biomarkers may be useful but do not directly identify the pathways linked to pathology in the kidney. An approach that integrates tissue structure with functional readouts in a kidney biopsy would be a major advance. We are developing a computational platform that leverages mass spec imaging data coupled with computational pathology for kidney tissue as a technology that will address this unmet need. With our computational platform we can identify signatures linked to normal and abnormal pathology on the same tissue section. This is a powerful approach to understand kidney pathology and will be of great value for drug development for kidney disease. Parameters related to reproducibility across pre-clinical models of diabetic kidney disease interpretation will be optimized during Phase I. Upon completion of the SBIR Phase I project we will have rigorous data to determine consistency of diseased glomerular signatures in diabetic nephropathy. This proof of concept data will make it attractive to pharma and biotech to adopt this platform for application for their therapeutic programs for diabetic kidney disease. Project Narrative Existing technologies only identify altered structures in kidney biopsies without providing insight into why the pathology is there and progressing. With the new computational platform incorporating mass spec imaging data coupled to computational pathology developed at SygnaMap we can localize functional alterations of diseased structures in a biopsy. By establishing reproducibility in our technology with this Phase I SBIR, we will offer pharma disease-relevant targets to develop precision therapies for patients with diabetic kidney

"Computational Methods for Designing Optimal Genomics-guided Viral Diagnostics Project Summary/Abstract Viral genome sequencing is growing exponentially and cutting-edge molecular technologies, guided by genomic data, show great promise in detecting and responding to viruses. Yet we lack a computational framework that efficiently leverages viral data to design the nucleic or amino acid sequences applied by these technologies. The proposal provides a career development plan to (i) build computational techniques — algorithms, models, and software — that yield highly accurate diagnostic assays, with potential to outperform existing ones, and (ii) use the techniques to proactively design assays for detecting 1,000s of viruses. The project will first develop methods for designing optimal viral genome-informed diagnostics. The study will formulate objective functions that evaluate an assay’s performance across a distribution of anticipated viral targets. Combinatorial optimization algorithms and generative models, constructed in the study, will optimize the functions. The project will also develop datasets for training predictive models of assay performance, which are used in the objective functions, focusing on CRISPR-, amplification-, and antigen-based diagnostics. Preliminary experimental results suggest such models can render assays with exquisite sensitivity and specificity. The study will compare the algorithmically-designed assays to state-of-the-art tests for four viruses. With these methods, the project will design diagnostic assays that are species-specific and broadly effective across genomic diversity for all viruses known to infect vertebrates. The study will build a system to monitor the assays’ effectiveness against emerging viral genomic diversity and to continually update them as needed. To enable the broad adoption of these methods, the project will implement them efficiently in accessible software. The proposal aligns with a NIAID goal of improving diagnostics via data science. The methods developed here may also aid therapy and vaccine design, and will leave the world better prepared to combat viral outbreaks. The career development award will provide training for the candidate in applied areas of long-term interest to his career. The candidate has previous experience in developing computational methods and analyzing viral genomes. Through the award, he will gain new knowledge and skills in diagnostic applications, alongside formal and informal training in immunology, bioengineering, and related laboratory techniques. This training will help the candidate progress toward therapy and vaccine applications that could benefit from advanced computational methods. The Broad Institute provides a supportive environment for the candidate’s development, including career development workshops, research seminars aligned with the proposed plan, and opportunities to initiate collaborations with scientists having expertise complementary to the candidate’s. The research and training will help him form an independent research group focused on developing and applying computational methods to enable more effective microbial surveillance and response. Project Narrative Viral genomic data is reshaping how we prepare for and respond to viral threats, but there is a scarcity of computational techniques that harness this vast, ever-growing data for designing diagnostic assays. The project will develop and test algorithms, machine learning models, and software systems to efficiently design highly accurate diagnostic assays by optimizing well-defined objective functions, applied to multiple diagnostic technologies, and will build a resource of broadly effective diagnostic assays for 1,000s of viral species.

"Dominance on the human genome and non-additive polygenic models for predicting complex traits Project Abstract Dominance is one of the most fundamental concepts in genetics and has many key implications in population genetics, as it ultimately determines how selection manifests in a population. However, despite its unarguable importance, dominance is also one of the least characterized quantities in genetics, especially in humans, with the major challenge being current methods cannot distinguish dominance from the fitness effect of genomic variants. This proposed K99/R00 work will systematically address this longstanding problem from a dual- perspectives, by inferring dominance in humans and quantitatively model its role in shaping the phenotypes of complex traits and diseases. Specifically, in Aim1, I will develop a powerful machine learning-based method to infer the realistic distribution of dominance on the human genome in megabase-scale, leveraging archaic introgressed ancestry in non-African populations that is sensitive to dominance variation in genomic regions. In Aim 2, I will develop non-additive polygenic models accounting for dominance in full genomic regions to identify complex traits profiled in UK Biobank that deviate from additive models, improve the accuracy of phenotype and disease risk predictions, and contribute to an in-depth understanding of complex trait biology. Finally, in Aim 3 (R00 phase), I will extend these approaches to infer dominance variation in worldwide populations and investigate how dominance, combined with selection and admixture, determines complex trait phenotypes in diverse human populations. The mentored phase of this work will take place at the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at UCLA, where Dr. Zhang will have access to rich training opportunities and be supported by active scientific communities, including numerous seminar series, journal clubs, and networking activities. Dr. Kirk Lohmueller (primary mentor) and Dr. Sriram Sankararaman (co-mentor) will train Dr. Zhang in computational and statistical methods in population genetics, machine learning applications, and large-scale disease association data analysis. The research trainings, collaborations, and professional development during the K99 phase will assist Dr. Zhang in becoming an independent investigator in human population genetics. Project Narrative Dominance plays a vital role in human evolutionary genetics both in terms of its fitness effect on functional genomic variants and how it shapes complex trait phenotypes, while its distribution on the human genome and biological effects on complex traits are poorly characterized. This work will fill a critical knowledge gap by producing a complete picture of dominance distribution in humans, which will shed a light into many unsolved questions in genetics, including the evolution of dominance. This work will further provide comprehensive statistical frameworks to model the relationship between dominance and complex trait phenotypes, which will substantially improve the transferability of biomedical applications in historically understudied populations, including disease risk prediction and the development of precision medicine.",Dominance on the human genome and non-additive polygenic models for predicting complex traits,10283330,K99GM143466,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Biology ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Demography ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Ecology ', ' Bionomics ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Evolution ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Minority People ', ' Minority Population ', ' Modernization ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' human population genetics ', ' trait ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Study Subject ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Reporting ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' functional genomics ', ' Genomics ', ' Address ', ' fitness ', ' Admixture ', ' Research Training ', ' Resolution ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' genomic region ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' genome wide association study ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' training opportunity ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' polygenic risk score ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K99,2021,82828,CA-33
"The maternal microbiome in childhood growth and immunity during undernutrition Globally, undernutrition contributes to 44% of childhood deaths under the age of five 1. Stunting, or reduced linear growth, is a major complication of undernutrition that is associated with increased risk of metabolic and infectious disease, reduced educational attainment and poor cognitive function later in life 3. Stunted mothers are more likely to experience complications during childbirth, and to give birth to stunted children 5. In turn, many children that are born stunted do not recover despite current therapeutic interventions 4. Therefore, stunting is often referred to as an intergenerational syndrome, and new approaches are desperately needed to improve childhood growth in vulnerable populations. The maternal immune system plays a major role in shaping offspring physical, cognitive and immune development. The gut microbiota likewise influences both local and systemic immunity, raising the possibility that the maternal microbiome could influence fetal and childhood development. We hypothesize that maternal gut microbial composition shapes the fetal immune environment to control offspring growth and immune development during undernutrition. We propose to use a mouse model of intergenerational undernutrition to identify specific immune and microbial targets for therapeutic intervention. Our preliminary data demonstrate that breeding mice colonized with microbiota from healthy or severely stunted donors produce offspring with divergent weight, bone, and immune developmental phenotypes that persist into maturity. We will use this model to isolate the role of the maternal gut microbiome from the neonatal microbiome, giving critical insight into the window of potential intervention. We will also identify specific subsets of microbes that are capable of influencing offspring growth and immune development and characterize microbial metabolic products associated with these changes. Finally, we will identify maternal immune cells and signaling pathways that respond to these microbial communities to control healthy growth and immune development in offspring. These experiments will identify specific microbial species as well as host immune pathways to target therapeutically and define the appropriate developmental stage in which to intervene. The Cowardin lab is located within the Child Health Research Center at the University of Virginia, and as a member of the Trans- University Miocrobiome Initiative, is uniquely suited to pursuing these studies. The lab has both the infrastructure and expertise required for successful completion of these goals. Ultimately, this proposal will lead to potential probiotic and immunotherapeutic treatments to disrupt the transmission of stunting from mother to child. Childhood undernutrition is a pervasive problem worldwide, resulting in reduced linear growth (stunting), increased risk of disease and cognitive defects that persist into adulthood. Maternal health profoundly influences fetal and childhood development, and mothers that are stunted are more likely to give birth to stunted children. Because gut microbes influence growth and immune function, we propose to investigate the role of the maternal microbiota in shaping offspring health, with the goal of identifying specific microbial species and immune pathways for targeted intervention to ameliorate the global burden of undernutrition.",The maternal microbiome in childhood growth and immunity during undernutrition,10276044,R01HD105729,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Animals ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' B blood cells ', ' B cell ', ' B cells ', ' B-Cells ', ' B-cell ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' bone ', ' Breeding ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Complication ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Environment ', ' Flow Cytometry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometries ', ' Flow Cytofluorometry ', ' Flow Microfluorimetry ', ' Flow Microfluorometry ', ' flow cytophotometry ', ' Gnotobiotic ', ' Gnotobiotics ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Heterozygote ', ' heterozygosity ', ' Homozygote ', ' Housing ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Immunity ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Maternal Health ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Mothers ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Productivity ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Syndrome ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' T-Cells ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' tomography ', ' Universities ', ' Virginia ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' Malnutrition ', ' Nutritional Deficiency ', ' Undernutrition ', ' dietary deficiency ', ' malnourished ', ' nutrition deficiency ', ' nutrition deficiency disorder ', ' nutritional deficiency disorder ', ' improved ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Infant Health ', ' Chemicals ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' insight ', ' Fostering ', ' chemokine ', ' Chemotactic Cytokines ', ' Homologous Chemotactic Cytokines ', ' Intercrines ', ' SIS cytokines ', ' chemoattractant cytokine ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Metabolic ', ' Shapes ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavior Control ', ' Adoptive Transfer ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' Investigation ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' postnatal ', ' Techniques ', ' fetal ', ' Probiotics ', ' experience ', ' lymphocytopoiesis ', ' Lymphopoiesis ', ' intergenerational ', ' microbial ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' member ', ' offspring ', ' mate ', ' Partner in relationship ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting -

"POR and Training Program on Multidrug-Resistant Organisms ABSTRACT Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the most pressing public health priorities. AMR is thought to be re- sponsible for more than 35,000 deaths in the US with a projection of 300 million deaths worldwide by 2050. My original K24 application sought to increase my ability to conduct patient oriented research (POR) on antibiotic resistance and mentor a new generation of clinicians scientists on different aspects of this important public health threat. With support from the K24 award, I was able to markedly increase my research portfolio, launch a microbial genomics mission and increase my mentoring activities. Thus, the overarching goal of this com- petitive K24 renewal is to fully transition to an established investigator by continuing and further strengthening my POR portfolio and mentoring abilities. I also aim to fortify my leadership skills to expand an ambitious re- search and training program, focused on AMR. Supported in part by my original K24 award, I founded the Cen- ter for Antimicrobial Resistance and Microbial Genomics (CARMiG) at UTHealth. The vision of CARMiG was to amalgamate the world-class expertise available in the Houston’s Texas Medical Center (TMC) to serve as a major platform for cutting edge research programs and integrate a training mission to the highest level. I also led the creation of the Gulf Coast Consortium on Antimicrobial Resistance (GCC-AMR), an inter-institutional hub for AMR researchers across the TMC to interact and foster collaborations. We developed a robust training program on AMR, recruiting and supporting the career of a diverse pool of trainees (MD, PhDs and PharmDs) at different stages of their careers. My trainees have secured 4 NIH K developments awards (2 with perfect scores), and equivalent independent grants. Furthermore, the number of trainee’s publications has markedly expanded (94 publications as firs/corresponding author). Our NIH grant portfolio also grew with more than $ 20 million brought in as PI of NIH grants in the last 5 years, including a recent P01 program ($11m). We were also able to secure the first post-doctoral inter-institutional T32 training program on AMR. Thus, the foundations of my initial K24 program put me in an ideal position to sustain and further strengthen my research and training objectives. In my original K24 program I focused on the clinical and genomic aspects of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) one of the most challenging organisms in clinical settings. Using the expertise acquired in VRE, my K24 renewal will support new areas of research, including the intersection of microbiome science and AMR, genomics and molecular epidemiology of Gram-negative pathogens and use of machine learning to es- tablish clinical/genomic correlates in patients infected with multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO). The spe- cific aims are: i) strengthen my portfolio of POR related to AMR as the foundation for trainees to develop their careers, and ii) mentor talented young investigators in translational and POR focused on AMR. I plan to con- tinue my robust mentoring program that integrates the understanding of the molecular and genomic bases of resistance and their translation into clinical practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a top public-health priority. Training the next generation of clinician scientists and translational scholars is critical to tackle the dire consequences of AMR. After building a successful patient-oriented and translational program on AMR with a major training component, I plan to leverage these resources to expand my training, research and leadership capabilities in AMR, contributing to solve this major public health crisis.",POR and Training Program on Multidrug-Resistant Organisms,10301971,K24AI121296,"['Award ', ' Bacteremia ', ' bacteraemia ', ' Cefazolin ', ' Cell membrane ', ' Cytoplasmic Membrane ', ' Plasma Membrane ', ' plasmalemma ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Evolution ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Infection ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Mission ', ' Names ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Talents ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translations ', ' United Nations ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Generations ', ' Immunocompromised Host ', ' Immunocompromised ', ' Immunocompromised Patient ', ' Immunosuppressed Host ', ' immunosuppressed patient ', ' Enterococcus ', ' Streptococcus enterococcus group ', ' Antibiotic Resistance ', ' Resistance to antibiotics ', ' Resistant to antibiotics ', ' antibiotic drug resistance ', ' antibiotic resistant ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Molecular Epidemiology ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' Medical center ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' muscle strengthening ', ' resistance training ', ' strength training ', ' Genomics ', ' patient oriented study ', ' patient oriented research ', ' Multiple Anti-bacterial Drug Resistance ', ' Multiple Anti-bacterial Drug Resistant ', ' Multiple Antibacterial Drug Resistance ', ' Multiple Antibacterial Drug Resistant ', ' Resistance to Multiple Anti-bacterial Drug ', ' Resistance to Multiple Antibacterial Drug ', ' Resistant to Multiple Anti-bacterial Drug ', ' Resistant to Multiple Antibacterial Drug ', ' multi-drug resistant bacteria ', ' multidrug resistant bacteria ', ' Multiple Bacterial Drug Resistance ', ' Vancomycin-resistant enterococci ', ' Vancomycin resistant enterococcus ', ' Institution ', ' Clinical Microbiology ', ' Antimicrobial resistant ', ' Resistance to antimicrobial ', ' anti-microbial resistance ', ' anti-microbial resistant ', ' resistance to anti-microbial ', ' resistant to anti-microbial ', ' resistant to antimicrobial ', ' Antimicrobial Resistance ', ' Pharm.D.

"Computational Pathology of Proteinuric Diseases Project Summary/Abstract: Computational Pathology for Proteinuric Glomerulopathies The presently employed morphology-based classification system of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and minimal change disease (MCD) does not adequately capture the clinical and molecular heterogeneity of these diseases and impairs the ability of clinicians to precisely define a patient’s disease, or predict outcome or effective intervention. The goal of this research is to advance the work of the glomerular disease research community by identifying biologically-relevant surrogates and subclasses of FSGS/MCD using computational pathology and machine learning methods. Prospective, longitudinal, multi-dimensional data sets that include digital kidney biopsies and molecular and clinical information can be analyzed by advanced “computer vision” methods and machine learning analytical approaches. This project will employ these rich resources and methods, which offer an unprecedented opportunity to leverage information derived from kidney tissue to improve the diagnosis, outcome prediction, and identification of glomerular disease mechanisms. The interdisciplinary team assembled to conduct this study has vast experience and a long-standing history of collaboration. In our preliminary studies we have demonstrated that (i) structural changes associate with outcomes and molecular mechanisms and improve clinical outcome prediction beyond current clinical approaches, and that (ii) computer vision technology can be used to accurately and efficiently detect normal and abnormal kidney structures and quantify textural (i.e., the spatial relationship between pixel values) and morphological (i.e., shape, size) information from kidney tissue. We will test our central hypothesis that inherent in the complexity of the structural changes in the renal parenchyma is information predictive of underlying disease biology and clinical outcome. We will pursue this hypothesis (1) by testing the clinical and molecular relevance of automatic detection and quantification of known morphologic biomarkers of clinical outcomes and mechanisms and of groups of patients with similar DL-derived morphologic characteristics; (2) by extracting next-generation pathomic features from DL-derived morphologic parameters and by testing their associations—individually and combined into pathomic profiles—with clinical outcomes and gene expression; and (3) by building machine learning-based models that integrate computer vision-derived pathology data with gene expression and clinical data to predict individual patient clinical outcomes, and to assess the additive prediction value of each data domain. Finally, we will group patients using the biomarkers identified to be most predictive of clinical outcomes. Ultimately, our work will contribute to a foundation for the deployment of a comprehensive artificial intelligence-guided precision medicine program for FSGS/MCD, applying descriptive, predictive, and ultimately prescriptive analytics as support tools for practicing pathologists and nephrologists. Project Narrative The computer vision technologies and machine learning methods applied in this grant will facilitate a precision medicine approach for nephrotic syndrome patients through automated histologic assessment of renal biopsies and comprehensive characterization of kidney structure, function, and molecular endophenotypes.

"Data-Driven Learning Framework for Fast Quantitative Knee Joint Mapping PROJECT SUMMARY Osteoarthritis (OA), a leading cause of chronic disability in the elderly population, occurs with the degradation of the extracellular matrix of articular cartilage, mainly composed of proteoglycan, collagen fibers, and water. Early diagnosis of cartilage degeneration requires the detection of changes in proteoglycan concentration and collagen integrity, preferably non-invasively and before any morphological changes occur. Spin-spin relaxation time (T2) and spin-lattice relaxation time in the rotating frame (T1ρ) can provide quantitative information about the structure and biochemical composition of the cartilage before morphological changes occur. Mono-exponential (ME) models can characterize the T2 and T1ρ relaxation processes and map it for articular cartilage in the knee joint. A recent meta-analysis showed that T1ρ provides more discrimination than T2 for OA. However, the ME model alone cannot provide distinct information from different compartments of the cartilage. Recent studies have shown that T1ρ relaxation might have bi-exponential (BE) components, following the hypothesis of the multi- compartmental structure of the cartilage. BE T2 relaxation has shown better diagnostic performance than ME for OA and can show the dispersion of the relaxation times, reflecting the heterogeneity in the macromolecular environment of water in the cartilage. BE analysis of cartilage typically requires a larger number of acquisitions with different spin-lock times (TSLs) or echo times (TEs), resulting in long scan time. High spatial resolution is also needed to visualize the thin and curved cartilage and fine structures in the knee joint. As a result, in vivo application of BE three-dimensional (3D) T1ρ and T2 mapping techniques is still very limited. Compressed sensing (CS) combined with parallel imaging (PI) can accelerate acquisition and reduce the scan time required for ME 3D T1ρ and T2 mappings. T1ρ scans can be reduced from 30 min to ~3 min with an error smaller than 6.5%. However, the error is two to three times larger for BE mapping. This problem can be potentially solved by optimizing the sampling times (TSLs for T1ρ and TEs for T2) and the free parameters of the CS approach (k- space sampling pattern, regularization function, regularization parameter, and minimization algorithm parameters) using fully sampled 3D knee joint datasets, supported by machine learning tools. The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop, optimize, and translate a high-spatial-resolution, rapid 3D magnetic resonance imaging sequence using data-driven learning-based CS for assessment of the human knee joint and using ME and BE 3D T1ρ (T2) mapping for improved biochemical characterization of cartilage and menisci on a standard clinical 3T scanner. PROJECT NARRATIVE Osteoarthritis of the knee is a leading cause of disability in elderly people, and no curative treatments exist. Early detection of osteoarthritis might help delay or prevent the onset of disability later in life.

"Genomic Insights into Human Population Mixture and its Role in Adaptation and Disease Project Summary  Recent studies have shown that population mixture (or `admixture') is pervasive throughout human evolution and has played a major role in shaping human genetic and phenotypic variation. Despite the ubiquity and importance of population mixture, we still lack adequate methods to characterize the impact of admixture on a genomic scale and leverage this information for effective gene mapping. Addressing these topics is the central focus of research in my lab. In this proposal, our goal is to develop new methods to reconstruct fine-scale genomic ancestry in admixed groups and leverage this information to identify novel disease and adaptive mutations and genes. The application of these methods to large genomic surveys will help to discover novel disease and adaptive variants.  The first step in characterizing the genomic impact of admixture is to infer the ancestry of each chromosomal segment, referred to as local ancestry. Towards this goal, we are developing new methods for local ancestry inference using machine-learning approaches that are ideally suited for classification problems and computationally tractable for large datasets. Our preliminary results show that our method is highly accurate and applicable across a range of demographic models. With reliable local ancestry inference, we will be well placed to study the impact of admixture on disease architecture and evolution of complex traits. We propose to use Admixture Mapping, a method to identify disease associations by leveraging ancestry differences across the genome, between cases and controls or among cases alone. By applying Admixture Mapping to complex admixed groups like South Asians and Latinxs, we aim to discover new population- specific disease associations and advance our understanding of disease architecture. Further, we will develop a novel method to leverage the demographic history of admixed groups to identify adaptive variants. By applying the method to study selection at various timescales in human evolution, we will uncover candidate genes and pathways related to adaptive gene flow and characterize its role in shaping human genetic variation. Finally, we will build reference-free ancestral genomes by recovering chromosomal segments of our lost ancestors hidden in admixed genomes. We will use these genomes to reconstruct the demographic history of our ancestors, as well as understand the fitness effects of population mixtures and the phenotypic legacy of our extinct ancestors.  The successful completion of the proposed project will provide new statistical tools to leverage patterns of admixture to perform effective disease mapping and evolutionary inference in diverse, admixed groups. Application of these methods to large-scale genomic datasets will provide insights into the genetic, evolutionary, and functional impact of admixture during human evolution. Algorithms proposed here will be implemented in freely available software for use by other researchers. Project Narrative Although population mixture or admixture is pervasive through human evolution, we still lack adequate statistical methods to study its functional and evolutionary impact. Our goal in this proposal is to develop a suite of computational methods to characterize the local genomic structure of admixed populations and use this information for a range of applications from gene mapping to reconstructing ancestral genomes. These tools will help to analyze data from admixed groups as efficiently as homogeneous populations, and provide novel insights into the genetic and phenotypic legacy of admixture in human evolution.",Genomic Insights into Human Population Mixture and its Role in Adaptation and Disease,10276371,R35GM142978,"['Algorithms ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Chromosome Mapping ', ' Gene Localization ', ' Gene Mapping ', ' Gene Mapping Genetics ', ' Linkage Mapping ', ' Total Human and Non-Human Gene Mapping ', ' genetic mapping ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Evolution ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' insight ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' trait ', ' novel ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' case control ', ' Genomics ', ' structural genomics ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Address ', ' fitness ', ' Admixture ', ' Data ', ' South Asian ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Population ', ' admixture mapping ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' computational suite ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' Latinx ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R35,2021,376839,CA-13
"Advancing 3D optical body surface scan technology to assess physiological and psychological effects in highly obese population Project Summary Current techniques for measuring the physiological or psychological effects of obesity, and in particular bariatric surgery, either lack sensitivity, are invasive, or require expensive specialized devices. For measuring the physiological effects, BMI is commonly used to diagnose obesity despite the known shortcomings as a marker for metabolic syndrome. Biomarkers such as anthropometric measurements (e.g., waist-to-hip ratio) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) have been shown to be superior to BMI in predicting health risks associated with obesity, but these measures lack sensitivity, specificity, or are expensive. Another key morbidity associated with obesity is non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The gold standard to the diagnosis and assessment of these conditions is histologic evaluation of liver biopsies. Fibroscan transient elastography is a noninvasive test which can also assess fibrosis, but high BMI and severe steatosis can decrease its accuracy. These approaches are either invasive, expensive, or relatively inaccurate. Measures of self-body perception are commonly used to assess psychological aspects of obesity, as body image is an important motivator for diet, physical activity, and weight loss intention. Body image perception is commonly assessed using self-reports and cartoon-like line drawings which are non-subject specific and insensitive. Based on our preliminary work (R21HL124443) that developed optical body scanning technology to capture 3D body shapes using inexpensive hardware, we propose to use the technology to study the physiological and psychological effects on subjects with severe obesity:  · Develop prediction algorithm for hepatic steatosis, fibrosis, adiposity, and blood biomarkers using optical  scans. The optical scan and biopsy data will be used as the training and validation set to develop a  machine learning algorithm to cheaply and non-invasively predict the biomarkers from 3D body surface data.  · Develop the use of optical scans for measuring the physiological effects of obesity. We will conduct a  cross sectional and longitudinal study to further assess the use of optical surface scans to determine  health indicators associated with obesity (using data from surface scan, DXA and serum biomarkers) for  one year following surgery. We will establish a database of such data along with software for data mining  the database.  · Develop the use of optical scans for measuring the psychological effects of obesity. We will collect 3D  surface geometry of each subject using optical scans and morph these to produce subject-specific images of larger or smaller body shape. We will use these images to study perception related to obesity and in particular patients undergoing post-operative body changes Project Narrative Precise optical scanning of 3D whole body shape is now possible with cheap commercial scanners available on smart phones and tablets. These cheap and accessible scans may hold a heretofore-untapped wealth of health- related information that can be utilized with machine learning.

"Uncover Spatial-Constraint Related Morphome Using Tissue-on-a-Chip Platform and Data-Driven Mathematical Modeling PROJECT SUMMARY Cell behaviors and tissue developments often occur under spatial constraints (e.g., interstitial space, tissue lining, skull enclosure). The current in vitro systems are often open cultures, and thus miss the spatial constraints and other in vivo stimuli. The current in vivo models are often low throughput and hard-to-trace, therefore unable to unravel the complex interplay between intrinsic influences (e.g., genetics/epigenetics) and extrinsic ones (e.g., micro-environment). For example, cell membrane blebbing and brain folding are fundamental and impactful bio-behaviors under spatial constraints. Their biophysical and molecular mechanisms are not well understood. Lately, several experimental and theoretical tools have emerged to fascinate the modeling of complex bio-behaviors. This proposed study aims to parameterize morphological information, relate to the complex influences under spatial constraints, and unravel the mechanism of bio- behaviors in the two exemplified areas. It will be done through a morphome platform that integrates several experimental-theoretical tools (e.g., tissue-on-a-chip, data-driven modeling, machine-learning), which has been pre-defined by PI and Co-Is. We hope to 1) fill the compelling gaps in our understanding of membrane blebbing and brain folding process and 2) establish an effective strategy to uncover a broad range of basic biological processes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Many biological behaviors and functions are realized through the formation and changes of the shapes of biological systems. However, the mechanism of how some biological shapes are determined and changed in a limited body space remains unknown. How these shape-changes direct biological behaviors are also poorly understood. This work aims to uncover these processes and answer mechanistic questions that have not yet been fully addressed, with the hope of developing a new strategy for investigating biosciences. .",Uncover Spatial-Constraint Related Morphome Using Tissue-on-a-Chip Platform and Data-Driven Mathematical Modeling,10278972,R35GM143194,"['Behavior ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cell membrane ', ' Cytoplasmic Membrane ', ' Plasma Membrane ', ' plasmalemma ', ' In Vitro ', ' cranium ', ' Skull ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Stimulus ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Genetic ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' interstitial ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' fascinate ', ' Modeling ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' in vivo Model ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cell behavior ', ' cellular behavior ', ' biological systems ', ' ']",NIGMS,UTAH STATE UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,258012,UT-01
"Combining chemical and computational tools for predictive models of microbiome communities ABSTRACT The gut microbiome has a tremendous impact on health and disease, actively contributing to obesity, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, cardiovascular diseases, and several poorly understood neurological disorders. We do not yet have the necessary tools to precisely probe these microbial communities, though such tools could unlock extensive benefits to human health. Elucidating the contributions of individual species or consortia of bacteria would provide a rational basis for understanding microbiota-controlled disease and lead to novel therapies. To carry out the fundamental research planned in this proposal, we will tackle three major problems: First, we will build the first set of molecular tools that effectively and precisely modulate the microbiome bacteria; second, we will analyze the multiscale dynamics of microbial communities; and third, we will construct an ingestible biosensor for real-time monitoring of microbiome populations. Although antibiotics and fecal transplants can reconfigure microbial consortia, they do not precisely target individual bacteria. Conversely, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have evolved to selectively attack pathogenic bacteria but do not target microbiome bacteria, constituting desirable scaffolds for molecular engineering and potential sources of microbiome-targeting agents. We will develop a new computational peptide design methodology, based on classical and hybrid-quantum mechanical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, to create a groundbreaking assessment of the dynamical and emergent properties of AMPs. Chemical synthesis and large-scale screening will confirm predicted selectivity against microbiome species, and a machine learning workflow will connect sequences of individual peptides to their dynamics and activity. We will then apply the synthetic AMPs to interrogate the human microbiome by selectively removing species during bacterial consortia experiments, to be carried out in bioreactors, under regular or anaerobic conditions. We will pair our experiments with whole-cell metabolic network models, providing a systems biology perspective to the analysis of inter-species interactions. An integrated ingestible biosensing device will be developed to monitor the microbiome by electrochemically sensing unique biomarkers from gut microbes. This will provide the first real-time measurements of microbiome composition and will be integrated to our bioreactors for testing, to ultimately be used for in vivo tests. This work will build the first set of molecular and computational tools for microbiome engineering and will lay the foundation to address critical gaps in our understanding of the gut micro-environment, and of the contributions of gut bacteria to the etiology of disease. Grounded in our demonstrated expertise in synthetic biology, computer science, microbiology, and electrical engineering, this project will provide a computational- experimental framework for developing a peptide encyclopedia for the gut microbiome, in line with NIH's public health mission and goals. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The gut microbiome plays roles in nutrition, immunity, metabolism, and several poorly understood neurological disorders. Suitable tools, however, do not yet exist for engineering the microbial communities that constitute the human microbiome.

"Obesity Prevention in Postpartum Women at High-Risk of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY  Obesity is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) disease that affects 39% of adults in the U.S. Obesity rates are disproportionately rising among women and contribute to increasing rates of diabetes and CV mortality among women younger than 55 years. Pregnancy represents a life transition when many women gain excess weight. The effect of obesity is further magnified in women with preeclampsia, an independent and underappreciated risk factor for future CV disease. There is a pressing need to better understand predictors of excessive postpartum weight retention in order to deliver effective and scalable weight loss interventions during a period when women at highest risk may be particularly receptive to lifestyle change.  Social incentives, or the influences that impact behavior change based on relationships, are strong motivators of healthy behavior. The use of game design elements, such as goal-setting, has been successfully combined with social incentives to enhance healthy behavior in other disease settings. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that a behavioral intervention using these novel approaches, combined with an established behavioral weight loss program, will provide an effective, and scalable solution to reduce the incidence of postpartum obesity. This proposal will leverage mentorship of senior investigators (Drs. Michal Elovitz and Peter Groeneveld) and Penn’s mature research programs in cardiovascular medicine, maternal fetal medicine, and behavioral economics. Research will be conducted in an urban and racially diverse population since these women are most likely to benefit from interventions to reduce CV risk. Aim 1 will use robust statistical methods and machine learning to create a clinical prediction tool for postpartum weight retention in an existing electronic health record database enriched with neighborhood-level data. Aim 2 will use qualitative and mixed methods to identify strategies to enhance the design of a pilot intervention using patient feedback. Aim 3 will implement a 2-arm single site randomized clinical trial to achieve weight loss in women with preeclampsia or gestational hypertension participating in an online behavioral weight loss program using remote technology and social feedback from other postpartum women.  This proposal will identify women at an early stage in life who will benefit the most from intensive lifestyle changes and will test and refine interventions that are able to be disseminated to postpartum women remotely. Dr. Lewey is a general cardiologist trained in women’s health and population science with established expertise in pregnancy associated cardiovascular disorders. The training she proposes in advanced statistical methods, qualitative analysis, and behavioral clinical trial design will position her to become a leader in women’s cardiovascular health. By the conclusion of this program, she will be able to independently design, target, and evaluate behavioral interventions to prevent heart disease in women. The results of the proposed K23 will be invaluable pilot work for a planned R01-level application. PROJECT NARRATIVE The postpartum period represents a unique time in a women’s life when many women gain excess weight and make the transition to becoming overweight or obese. We propose to rigorously study predictors of postpartum obesity and evaluate an innovative approach to improve weight loss in the postpartum period using an online behavioral weight loss program and social feedback from a team of other postpartum women. By identifying women at an early stage in life who will benefit the most from intensive lifestyle changes and testing interventions that are low cost, sustainable, and remotely delivered, we hope to significantly improve cardiovascular health and reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease in women, which is a central mission of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).",Obesity

"Big-Data Electron-microscopy for Novel Community Hypotheses: Measuring And Retrieving Knowledge (BENCHMARK) Project Summary In an effort to better understand structural organization and anatomy of nervous systems at unprecedented spatial resolution, recent efforts, including BRAIN Initiative funded projects, have collected increasingly larger datasets using Electron Microscopy (EM) and X-Ray Microtomography (XRM). We can now image neural tissue across a range of different scales, potentially forming the basis for the next generation of brain atlases at submicron and nanometer resolution. However, there is huge variability in data collection approaches, as well as ongoing research into evolving imaging technology, experimental protocols, data storage, and post- processing methods. Different resolutions, contrasts, staining, image corrections, data compression, machine learning algorithms, and metadata are all being developed. To enable comparison, meta-analysis, and registration with other datasets and imaging modalities, new standards for EM and XRM data are required, similar to those pursued in light microscopy, magnetic resonance imaging, and other domains. In this time period of growth in EM and XRM imaging, and its increased adoption and utilization for neuroscientific investigations, it is a critical time to implement standards that ensure interoperability, sustainability, and availability of these expensive datasets. This will be critical to enable openness, sharing between laboratories, and reproducible results on these large and expensive datasets. This proposal aims to develop standards for large scale EM and XRM structural data, as well as standards for annotations and links to complementary data sources. This will enable validation, sharing, and replication, greatly amplifying investment in other BRAIN initiative projects in this community. Our team will bring together a community of researchers into two complementary Working Groups (WGs) for Image and Experimental Metadata Standards and Annotation Standards. This community of interest will collaboratively develop standards and disseminate results in conjunction with BRAIN initiative projects and archives. Finally, this project will build tools to query and retrieve image and annotation data, including motif discovery, through a community portal and open source tools. This will allow scientists to reproducibly analyze data, test hypotheses, and share data products and results with the community. We will emphasize collaboration with existing standards across communities and the development and integration of software tools supporting the standards to ensure adoption. Project Narrative We propose the development of imaging and annotations data standards for the Electron Microscopy and X-ray Microtomography research communities. These standards will enable analysis and discovery on a new generation of large-scale nano- and micro-scale neuroanatomical and connectomics datasets.

"3D quantification of NASH-related liver fibrosis using open-top light-sheet microscopy Abstract Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) prevalence is estimated at >25% in the U.S., making it the most common cause of chronic liver disease. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the progressive form of NAFLD, affects 1-3% of the U.S. population and is expected to double by 2030. Currently, there is no effective pharmacotherapy for NAFLD, but there are numerous promising drug candidates being evaluated in clinical trials. However, the primary endpoint for these trials, histologic fibrosis, has shortcomings including sampling error and use of a subjective five category scale to quantify a continuous variable. Our team has pioneered the use of 3D open-top light-sheet (OTLS) microscopy, which enables rapid, high-throughput imaging of large clinical samples. In combination with cutting-edge machine learning techniques, we hypothesize that 3D OTLS microscopy can provide more accurate and consistent assessment of fibrosis in liver biopsies from NASH patients. We will test this hypothesis by developing a multiplex staining protocol and machine learning analysis pipeline, which will be piloted on 20 archived FFPE liver biopsies. Results from our assay will be correlated with currently used primary and secondary outcome measures to motivate further studies with sing archived samples from clinical trials with responsivity and outcomes data. Narrative Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) affects 1-3% of the U.S. population and is expected to double by 2030. There are many promising therapeutic agents to treat NASH, but the primary outcome, histologic fibrosis assessment, is plagued by sampling error and use of a subjective five category scale to quantify a continuous variable. We propose an assay to visualize and quantify liver fibrosis in 3D for more accurate and consistent NASH diagnostics.",3D quantification of NASH-related liver fibrosis using open-top light-sheet microscopy,10325461,R43DK130751,"['Affect ', ' Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Archives ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biopsy ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Collagen ', ' Cytoplasm ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Esters ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Future ', ' Gold ', ' Primary carcinoma of the liver cells ', ' Hepatocarcinoma ', ' Hepatocellular Carcinoma ', ' Hepatocellular cancer ', ' Hepatoma ', ' Liver Cells Carcinoma ', ' liver carcinoma ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Microscopy ', ' mortality ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Sampling Errors ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Stains ', ' Staining method ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Diagnostic radiologic examination ', ' Conventional X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic Radiology ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray Radiology ', ' Radiography ', ' Roentgenography ', ' X-Ray Imaging ', ' X-Ray Medical Imaging ', ' Xray imaging ', ' Xray medical imaging ', ' conventional Xray ', ' diagnostic Xray ', ' diagnostic Xray radiology ', ' Sirius Red F3B ', ' picrosirius red ', ' sirius red F 3B ', ' Trichrome stain ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Custom ', ' Microscope ', ' improved ', ' liver biopsy ', ' Liver lesion biopsy ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Liver Fibrosis ', ' fibrotic liver ', ' hepatic fibrosis ', ' Therapeutic Agents ', ' chronic hepatic disease ', ' chronic hepatic disorder ', ' chronic liver disorder ', ' chronic liver disease ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Complex ', ' human tissue ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Services ', ' drug efficacy ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Categories ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Sampling ', ' 3-D Imaging ', ' 3D imaging ', ' Three-Dimensional Imaging ', ' Formalin ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Pathologic ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' Cirrhosis ', ' cirrhotic ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Three-dimensional analysis ', ' 3-D analysis ', ' 3-dimensional analysis ', ' 3D analysis ', ' Outcome ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' 3-D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3D structure ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ', ' NASH ', ' non-alcohol induced steatohepatitis ', ' non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis ', ' non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ', ' nonalcoholic steato-hepatitis ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' drug candidate ', ' elastography ', ' elastic imaging ', ' elasticity imaging ', ' lightspeed ', ' light speed ', ' speed of light ', ' CLIA certified ', ' CLIA accredited ', ' CLIA approved ', ' CLIA compliant ', ' CLIA licensed ', ' non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ', ' NAFLD ', ' non-alcohol fatty liver disease ', ' non-alcoholic liver disease ', ' nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ', ' primary endpoint ', ' primary end point ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' analysis pipeline ', ' three-dimensional visualization ', ' 3-D visualization ', ' 3-dimensional visualization ', ' 3D visualization ', ' algorithm training ', ' antifibrotic treatment ', ' antifibrotic therapy ', ' sample archive ', ' ']",NIDDK,"LIGHTSPEED MICROSCOPY, INC.",R43,2021,269351,WA-07
"Development of a Precision Medicine-based Diagnostic Tool for Membranous Nephropathy Summary/Abstract The goal of this project is to develop a precision medicine approach to the rapid diagnosis of membranous nephropathy (MN) using automated statistical analysis of proteomic data obtained from kidney biopsies. This approach uses data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) and an algorithmic data pipeline capable of efficiently determining the most likely MN antigen types present in kidney biopsy tissue. MN is a heterogenous autoimmune kidney disease that is caused in most cases by the presence of circulating pathogenic autoantibodies that react with podocyte antigens leading to the formation and accumulation of pathogenic immune complexes around glomerular capillary loops. Using the example of PLA2R-type MN, determination of antigen type has been shown to be important for diagnosis, monitoring response to treatment and early detection of disease flares. Historically, determination of MN antigen type has been performed by immunostaining; however, this has become impractical due to the discovery of at least 17 antigen types. There often is not enough tissue in the biopsy sample to conduct this number of immunostains, and moreover the immunostaining process is both time and resource intensive. The use of DIA-MS provides a novel proteomics approach to antigen typing in which immune complexes are captured by elution from frozen biopsy tissue, digested into tryptic peptides, and then measured by DIA-MS. Candidate MN antigens are identified using algorithmic classification and then validated in a final immunostaining step to confirm the candidate antigen. Our preliminary studies indicate that this is a robust approach; however, the method is not scalable without a similarly robust data analysis pipeline. In this Phase I project, we will optimize the DIA-MS method and then collect quantitative data from known cases of the most common types of MN that can be used to develop, train, test and optimize algorithmic classification models using a machine learning (ML) approach. In order to train the ML models, we will collect DIA-MS protein abundance data from 50 samples each of PLA2R, THSD7A and Exostosin types of MN, as well as 50 samples that are negative for each of these antigens as controls. In the Phase II, we will build complete datasets for all known antigen types of MN and optimize the ML classifier model for diagnostic workflows. Successful completion of these aims will result in the development a comprehensive method to efficiently classify MN cases of any antigen type. These tools will advance the practice of renal pathology from a largely morphology-based approach of diagnosing disease to a precision medicine-based proteomics approach that will efficiently provide actionable information to clinicians caring for patients with MN. PROJECT NARRATIVE Membranous nephropathy is a heterogenous autoimmune kidney disease that is caused in most cases by the presence of circulating pathogenic autoantibodies that react with antigens in podocytes or circulating autoantigens, leading to the formation and accumulation of pathogenic immune complex deposits around glomerular capillary loops. New findings suggest that these pathogenic autoantibodies are formed in each case by an autoimmune response against a single autoantigen, and that the titer of autoantibodies can serve as a useful biomarker for activity of disease that can in turn be used to monitor disease status and guide therapy. In this Phase I application, we will develop analytical methods using Data Independent Mass Spectrometry (DIA- MS) and machine learning that will ultimately enable efficient identification of autoantigen types in kidney biopsies from patients with membranous nephropathy of any type.",Development of a Precision Medicine-based Diagnostic Tool for Membranous Nephropathy,10324016,R41DK130702,"['Accounting ', ' Algorithms ', ' Antibodies ', ' Antigen-Antibody Complex ', ' Immune Complex ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' Archives ', ' Autoantibodies ', ' autoimmune antibody ', ' autoreactive antibody ', ' self reactive antibody ', ' Autoantigens ', ' Autologous Antigens ', ' Self-Antigens ', ' Autoimmune Responses ', ' Biopsy ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Explosion ', ' Freezing ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Membranous Glomerulonephritis ', ' Extramembranous Glomerulopathy ', ' Membranous Glomerulonephropathy ', ' Membranous Glomerulopathy ', ' Membranous Nephropathy ', ' Goals ', ' Immunoglobulin G ', ' 7S Gamma Globulin ', ' IgG ', ' Immunoassay ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Laboratories ', ' Literature ', ' Lupus Nephritis ', ' Lupus Glomerulonephritis ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nephritis ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Peptides ', ' Proteins ', ' Proteinuria ', ' Publishing ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissue Extracts ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' G-substrate ', ' cerebellum protein substrate for cGMP dependent protein kinase ', ' protein G ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Phase ', ' Pythons ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Glomerular Capillary ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Funding ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Morphology ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Techniques ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' rapid diagnosis ', ' cohort ', ' Biopsy Sample ', ' Biopsy Specimen ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Proteomics ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Visceral Epithelial Cell ', ' glomerular visceral epithelial cell ', ' podocyte ', ' Incubated ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Flare ', ' Immunologics ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologically ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' data acquisition ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' clinical practice ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' clinical diagnostics ', ' classification algorithm ', ' kidney biopsy ', ' renal biopsy ', ' data pipeline ', ' data analysis pipeline ', ' data processing pipeline ', ' learning classifier ', ' feature selection ', ' Autoimmune ', ' pathogenic autoantibodies ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NIDDK,NEPHROPATHOLOGY ASSOCIATES,R41,2021,247778,AR-02
"Sensitive and Quantitative MS-bases Glycomic Mapping Platform Glycosylation is one of the most complex protein modifications; more than 50% of mammalian proteins are glycosylated. The fact that there are 100,000 proteoforms coded by only ~20,300 genes identified in the human genome emphasizes the importance of posttranslational modifications (PTMs) like glycosylation. Aberrant protein glycosylation has been implicated in many diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, congenital/metabolic disorders, diabetes, inflammation, Parkinson’s disease, bacterial/viral infectious diseases, and various cancers. More recently, glycans have been associated with coronavirus spike glycoproteins, including the SARS- CoV-2 virion. The diverse biological roles of glycans and their implications in diseases have created a demand for reliable qualitative and quantitative glycomic approaches, which facilitates sensitive investigation of glycan changes in different biological and biomedical samples. Mass spectrometry (MS) is the most efficient technique in glycomics due to its high sensitivity and capacity for acquiring structural information. However, glycomic research remains a challenge because of the microheterogeneity of glycan compositions in complex biological samples; the relatively low abundance in nature and low ionization efficiency in MS analysis; and the existence of variant positional and linkage isomers caused by the biosynthesis process. To overcome these challenges, several separation methods have been coupled to MS. Despite the development of these separation techniques, isomeric separation of glycans remains insufficient. There is an increasing demand for more efficient isomeric separation approaches since glycan isomers have been related to different diseases.  The main aim of this proposal is to provide easily accessible, adaptable, and affordable strategies for better separation and characterization of glycans and glycan isomers derived from different glycoconjugates. Aim 1 is focused on finding a replacement for porous craphitic carbon columns that sufferes from low reprodcubility and loss of resolution and efficiency with time. The in-house mesoporous graphitic carbon (MGC)-LC-MS will be investigated for both permethylated (Aim 1a) and native (Aim 2b) isomeric separation of N- and O-glycans, glycolipid glycans, and free oligosaccharides. Other alternatives (also part of Aim 1a), such as 50 cm and 200 cm micro pillar array columns (μPAC)-C18-LC-MS, and a 50 cm long capillary nanoC18-LC-MS, will also be evaluated to achieve an improved isomeric separation of glycan isomers. Subsequently, GUI will be utilized to improve the identification of glycan isomers. A GUI libraries for the separation strategies developed in Aim 1 will be established to normalize the possible retention time shift among different runs (Aim 2). LC-M based glycomics quantitative strategies will be developed and assessed in Aim 3. The combination of permethylation and TMT will capitalize on the advantages of both techniques, providing enhanced sensitivity and accuracy in glycan quantitation (Aim 3a). Additionally, the combination of 8-plex isotopic permethylation and 6-plex TMT will facilitate a reliable 48-plex, thus significantly increasing the throughput of analysis (Aim 3b). Furthermore, with the improved separation and identification (Aim 1 and 2), PRM will be employed to assist the better quantitation of glycans and the differentiation of glycan isomers. A library containing the fragments fingerprint of each glycan isomer will be created to aid the glycan isomeric identification (Aim 3c). The development of automated software for easy, fast, and accurate glycomic data processing is the main focus of Aim 4. Finally, the aforementioned strategies and tools will be applied to clinical samples to address a variety of biological and biomedical issues such as COVID-19, breast cancer brain metastasis, liver cancer vs. cirrhosis, kidney diseases, algae development, and others (Aim 5). The development of the proposed methods and algorithms will help us and our collaborators to better understand the attributes and biomedical significance of glycan isomers in the development and progression of esophageal, breast, and liver cancer. Furthermore, we expect the analytical tools and algorithms proposed here to benefit researchers and scientists who are interested in understanding the biological attributes of glycan isomers in other systems. The proposed research will enable the development of tools for the characterization of protein carbohydrate structures at a sensitivity, throughput, and level of detail not previously possible. The implementation of these tools will enable researchers to better understand the attributes and biomedical significance of glycans in the development and progression of a wide array of diseases. Examples of future benefits for public health include the identification of disease and cancer biomarkers for medical diagnostics and the monitoring of recombinant protein therapeutics, which will lead to better targeted drugs that are more bioactive with fewer side effects.",Sensitive and Quantitative MS-bases Glycomic Mapping Platform,10318016,R01GM112490,"['Adhesions ', ' Algae ', '

"Liver Cirrhosis Network: Clinical Research Center - Mayo Clinic PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Therapies aimed at preventing development of cirrhosis-related complications are lacking. Statins have been shown to improve liver function and attenuate portal hypertension although definitive studies are lacking. Our investigative team has deep expertise in cirrhosis and portal hypertension including clinical, translational, and laboratory aspects of disease. Our aims in this proposal are: Aim 1. To conduct a prospective, multicenter, observational study of patients with compensated cirrhosis that will serve as the foundation for discovery of novel mechanistic and therapeutic targets. We will consolidate a longitudinal database to (a) provide unique information on the natural history and outcomes of cirrhosis and (b) support translational research (proposed in Aim 3). This robust multicenter dataset will be used for the development and validation of an artificial intelligence-derived algorithm for prediction of decompensation combining extensive clinical, laboratory and radiographic data, including magnetic resonance elastography and electrocardiogram. Aim 2. To perform a multicenter prospective randomized phase 3 clinical trial of simvastatin versus placebo to improve outcomes in patients with compensated cirrhosis. This aim will test the hypothesis that simvastatin is superior to placebo for reducing complications of cirrhosis and overall mortality. This phase 3 efficacy trial will randomize patients to Simvastatin 20 mg or placebo daily with median follow up of 36 months. The primary endpoint will be development of varices, decompensating events or death analyzed as ordinal outcomes based six prognostic stages. Secondary endpoints will include fibrosis regression, incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma, and cardiovascular complications. Aim 3. To identify novel pathogenic targets in cirrhosis progression through 2 Sub-aims: Sub-Aim 3a. To investigate the rate of telomere attrition in cirrhosis progression and decompensation. Telomere shortening has been observed in advanced cirrhosis and preclinical studies have shown reduced fibrosis with telomere length restoration. However, the rate of telomere attrition in cirrhosis and its association with disease progression remain unknown. Our proposal will serve as the basis for future studies assessing new therapies aimed at telomere length preservation in cirrhosis and effects of statins. Sub-Aim 3b. To measure circulating markers of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and its correlation to development of hepatic decompensation. Anticoagulation has been shown to reduce hepatic decompensation in a small trial of patients with cirrhosis. Our group has recently shown that NETs drive intrahepatic thrombosis, and inhibition of NETs reduces portal pressure in preclinical studies. Thus, the results of this sub-aim will serve as the foundation for future human studies investigating novel therapies aimed at disrupting NETs in the liver. Our center and team have substantial expertise in clinical trials and therapeutics for advanced liver disease and are thus well poised to conduct these studies.

"Liver Cirrhosis Network: Clinical Research Centers The population burden of cirrhosis is rising especially related to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), alcohol- induced liver disease (ALD) and in those living with HIV. The progression of cirrhosis to liver-associated clinical events (LACE) and death is related to a diverse set of systemic and hepatic factors which may be etiology- specific or agnostic. There remain gaps in knowledge in assessing how these factors interact to cause cirrhosis- progression to outcomes. This limits rational development of non-invasive tools for risk-stratification and disease-monitoring purposes as well as the ability to holistically model the development of outcomes. There is also no established etiology-agnostic approach to reduce the risk of outcomes and death. This proposal, in response to RFA-DK-20-003, addresses these unmet needs with two specific aims: Aim 1: To conduct a prospective, multicenter, observational study of patients with cirrhosis of varying etiology that serves as the foundation for conducting novel mechanistic and therapeutic studies. Patients with compensated cirrhosis of varying etiology inclusive of NASH, ALD with and without HIV will be enrolled and followed prospectively with protocol-driven data and bio-sample collection. Outcomes will be assessed prospectively by a pre-specified adjudication process. Through collaboration with external partners, we will evaluate several promising tools (e.g. spleen-stiffness measurement), circulating biomarkers (PROC3-6, ELF test) and machine-learned approaches to obtain novel insights on fibrosis, factors driving outcomes and to model outcomes. The cohort data and bio-samples will further support mechanistic studies of factors driving fibrosis and outcomes. Aim 2: To perform a multi-center prospective randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the clinical utility of atorvastatin (10 mg/day x 2 yrs) in patients with compensated cirrhosis. Patients with compensated cirrhosis of varying etiology, stratified by varices and CTP score (5 or 6) will be enrolled. The trial design uses the estimand framework proposed by the FDA (ICH E9 R1). The primary endpoint captures benefit from a patient-perspective and is defined by survival without LACE or major adverse cardiac event or need for drug withdrawal for toxicity. The primary analysis will be a comparison of proportions of patients meeting the primary endpoint. The secondary analysis of benefit is a time-to-event analysis of clinical outcomes. Several measures to track safety and de-risk the study are proposed. A benefit-risk analyses using state of the art approach is proposed. Together, they will provide robust information on the utility of atorvastatin to improve outcomes in compensated cirrhosis. The feasibility of the studies is supported by a strong and extensive referral network, a robust tele-medicine program for liver disease and research infrastructure. The studies will have a major positive impact by: (1) providing robust outcomes data, (2) supporting mechanistic studies, (3) use of innovations to refine application of NITs, (4) model clinical outcome risk to inform future monitoring strategies, and (5) provide a treatment to slow this progression, thereby providing a way to reduce the burden of cirrhosis. Cirrhosis, which is the end-stage of liver injury can lead to complications and death, but it is difficult to predict which patients are at risk and therefore, to prevent them from happening. As part of this multi-center study, we aim to collect data and samples from hundreds of patients with cirrhosis and follow them over time to better define who is at greater risk for progression. We will also participate in a trial to prevent progression of disease in which a cholesterol- lowering medication, which has positive effects on liver disease, will be compared to placebo in a large group of patients with cirrhosis.",Liver Cirrhosis Network: Clinical Research Centers,10308126,U01DK130134,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', ' Anti-Inflammatories ', ' Anti-inflammatory ', '

"Feeding Machine Learning Algorithms with Mechanistic Data to Predict Outcomes of Copper-Catalyzed Couplings PROJECT SUMMARY Cross-coupling reactions that combine aryl halides with oxygen and nitrogen nucleophiles to form C-N and C-O bonds are vital tools for the synthesis of medicinally-relevant molecules. These reactions are often catalyzed by complexes of transition metals, such as palladium or copper. Copper-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions have several advantages over their palladium-mediated counterparts, but the disadvantages associated with copper catalysis often outweigh these benefits. Most Cu-catalyzed cross-coupling methods require high loadings of catalyst and high temperatures, and copper catalysts are often unable to effect cross-coupling of aryl chlorides. To address these issues, ligands that increase activity of copper catalysts for C-N and C-O cross-couplings have been sought, and oxalamide ligands have been shown to generate some of the most active catalysts. A series of publications by Ma have shown that such catalysts can, in some cases, react with 10,000 turnovers, and can cross-couple aryl chlorides, albeit at high temperature (120 °C) and loading of catalyst (5-10 mol %). However, identifying reaction conditions to promote cross-coupling of a given pair of substrates can be difficult – 12 different oxalamide ligands have been used to achieve couplings of different combinations of substrates in high yield. Herein, we propose to use mechanistic research, together with machine learning (ML), to facilitate the identification of reaction conditions for C-O cross-coupling reactions mediated by Cu salts with oxalamide ligands and to facilitate the development of improved ligands and methods. We hypothesize that mechanistic understanding can be used to build improved ML models that can use data sets on the order of 100-1000 points to predict reaction yield effectively. Once built, an ML model capable of predicting yield can be used to evaluate in-silico the potential of a ligand to generate a catalyst for the cross-coupling of aryl chlorides, or to predict reaction conditions to achieve high yield for a new combination of coupling partners. Our research strategy is as follows. First, we will elucidate the mechanism of C-O cross-coupling reactions catalyzed by copper salts with oxalamide ligands, and determine how ligand structure influences the reaction mechanism. The mechanistic insights gained will be used to identify or develop input for a machine learning model (features). We will use high-throughput experimentation tools to carry out 960 C-O coupling reactions with a variety of aryl halides, nucleophiles, and oxalamide ligands. The data set will be used to compare our hand- selected features with features selected by a ML algorithm by their ability to predict C-O coupling yield. The comparison will be made across three different ML optimization tasks. Our mechanistic studies will establish for the first time the mechanism of a C-O cross-coupling reaction catalyzed by Cu salts with oxalamide ligands, laying the foundation for the investigation of other C-O and C-N cross-coupling reactions using the same catalyst system. Our ML studies will establish methods that enable reasonably small datasets to predict reaction yield. PROJECT NARRATIVE The use of machine learning tools to predict the yield of chemical reactions is challenging, and often requires large quantities of training data. Herein, we propose to conduct mechanistic studies on C-O cross-coupling reactions promoted by Cu salts/oxalamide ligands, and to use the mechanistic information to design machine learning models that use small (100-1000 reactions) quantities of data to accurately predict reaction yield. Both the mechanistic data and the developed models will facilitate the identification of productive reaction conditions as well as the development of improved ligands and methods.",Feeding Machine Learning Algorithms with Mechanistic Data to Predict Outcomes of Copper-Catalyzed Couplings,10314079,F32GM140550,"['Adoption ', ' Air ', ' Bromides ', ' Catalysis ', ' Organic Chemistry ', ' Chlorides ', ' Communities ', ' Copper ', ' Cu element ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Foundations ', ' Hand ', ' Iodides ', ' Ligands ', ' Methods ', ' Nitrogen ', ' Oxygen ', ' O element ', ' O2 element ', ' Palladium ', ' Pd element ', ' Phosphines ', ' phosphane ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Salts ', ' Temperature ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' catalyst ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Fostering ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Reaction ', ' System ', ' Equation ', ' high temperature ', ' High temperature of physical object ', ' chemical reaction ', ' Informatics ', ' Structure ', ' chemical reaction rate ', ' reaction rate ', ' transition metal ', ' Transition Elements ', ' Modeling ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' Affinity ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' feeding ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Coupling ', ' aryl halide ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' in silico ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F32,2021,65994,CA-13

"Developing novel algorithms for spatial molecular profiling technologies Project Summary The location, timing and abundance of mRNA and proteins within a tissue underlie the basic molecular mechanisms of cell functions and physiological and pathological developments. For example, the study of expression of thousands of genes simultaneously at different locations could reveal great insights into embryo development, the cooperation of molecular and cellular processes for high-order mental functions, and the molecular basis and clinical impact of intra-tumor heterogeneity. Recent technology breakthroughs in spatial molecular profiling (SMP), including both imaging-based technologies and sequencing-based technologies, have enabled the comprehensive molecular characterization of single cells while preserving their spatial and morphological contexts. Due to the huge potential to deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cellular and physiological phenotypes, SMP technologies are rapidly gaining attention and a large amount of such data will be generated. However, there are only few computational methods developed to analyze such rich but complex data, and the limitations of computational methods lead to such valuable data being largely under-used. The overarching goal of this study is to develop computational methods to analyze SMP data to characterize detailed molecular spatial distributions and associate such information with cellular phenotypes and physiological phenotypes. The specific aims are as follows: 1. develop novel spatio-statistical methods to characterize spatial distributions of gene expression; 2. develop computational methods to characterize cellular spatial organizations and investigate their relationship with molecular spatial distributions and disease status; 3. develop user-friendly software to facilitate researchers in SMP data analysis and visualization. In order to achieve this goal, we have assembled a strong team with complementary expertise in single-cell genomics, tissue image analysis, spatial modelling, machine learning and software development. If implemented successfully, this platform will greatly facilitate users in understanding molecular and cellular spatial organization in biological tissues and provide comprehensive insights into the underlying biological processes.

"Characterizing the immune and metabolic profiles of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin tissue samples PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare, but potentially devastating malignancy of the skin. Early detection of CTCL is associated with positive clinical outcomes, but diagnosis is often complicated by the heterogeneous clinical and histological presentation. Additionally, systemic therapies remain sub- optimal for CTCL, highlighting the need for new treatment strategies. To date, most studies have been performed on blood from CTCL patients, which has revealed a complex interplay between host immunity, malignant T-cells and the tumor microenvironment. However, the molecular mechanisms that govern disease pathogenesis, especially in the skin, remain largely undefined.  The goal of the proposed research is to use new technologies that allow for multi-parametric, high- resolution analyses in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) skin tissue samples to define the immune and metabolic profiles of CTCL at different stages of disease. The first technology is Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging (MIBI), which uses secondary ion mass spectrometry to visualize up to 100 metal conjugated antibodies simultaneously at nanometer resolution in FFPE tissue sections. Specifically, Aim I will use MIBI to define the heterogeneity and plasticity of cells that exist at the CTCL tumor-host interface, to improve the precision with which CTCL is diagnosed and treated. The second technology is matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI), which can detect thousands of metabolites in FFPE tissue sections. Specifically, Aim II will use MALDI-MSI to determine the reflective metabolic activity of the CTCL microenvironment, thereby adding functional insight to disease pathogenesis and revealing potential metabolically active therapeutic targets.  Overall, these studies will characterize the molecular heterogeneity and functional complexity of CTCL, which will shed light on how this disease evades immune destruction and reprograms energy- metabolism.

"Bioinformatics Strategies for Genome Wide Association Studies The promise of precision medicine is to edit a patient’s DNA and/or administer therapeutics targeting etiologic molecules that prevent or reverse the disease process using a tailored design. All of this happens at the level of the individual and requires precision knowledge of that patient’s biology. In stark contrast, much of the knowledge we possess about genomic risk factors comes from statistical measures of association from human populations. The conceptual and practical disconnect between the populations we study and the individuals we want to treat is a major source of confusion about how to move forward in an era driven by genome technology. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop novel informatics methodology and software to facilitate precision medicine by connecting population and individual genomic phenomena. We propose here a Virtual Genomic Medicine (VGMed) workbench where clinicians can carry out thought experiments about the treatment of individual patients using models of disease risk derived from population-level studies. This will be accomplished by first developing a novel Genomics-guided Automated Machine Learning (GAML) algorithm for deriving risk models from real data that is accessible to clinicians (AIM 1). We will then develop a novel simulation approach that is able to generate artificial data that preserves the distribution of genetic effects observed in the real data while maintaining other characteristics such as genotype frequencies (AIM 2). This will generate open data allowing anyone to perform virtual interventions on patients derived from a population- level risk distribution. The workbench will allow editing of individual genotypes and simulate the administration of drugs by editing machine learning parameters in the simulation model (AIM 3). The change in risk and disease status for the specific patient will be tracked in real time. Finally, we provide a feature in the workbench that will allow the clinician to generate specific hypotheses about individual genetic variants that can then be validated using integrated knowledge sources that include databases such as PubMed and ClinVar thus giving the user immediate feedback (AIM 4). All methods and software will be provided as open-source (AIM 5). Most genetic studies of common human diseases result in statistical summaries of risk derived from human populations. These statistical summaries are not that helpful for determining the health of an individual. This proposal will create new computer algorithms and software help clinicians and researchers connect population- level statistics with individual level genetic effects to advance our understanding of how to treat patients based on their own unique genetic makeup.",Bioinformatics Strategies for Genome Wide Association Studies,10126058,R01LM010098,"['Algorithms ', ' Biology ', ' Community Medicine ', ' Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Feedback ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Patients ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Pythons ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Informatics ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' population-based study ', ' population-level study ', ' studies of populations ', ' study of the population ', ' Population Study ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' PubMed ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Data ', ' information resource ', ' knowledge resource ', ' knowledge resources ', ' Information Resources ', ' Population Analysis ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' genome wide association study ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' virtual ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' open source ', ' human disease ', ' therapeutic target ', ' Algorithmic Software ', ' Algorithmic Tools ', ' Software Algorithm ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' genetic makeup ', ' genetic make-up ', ' Genetic study ', ' Genomic medicine ', ' individual patient ', ' open data ', ' open science ', ' open-source data ', ' phenotypic data ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' data preservation ', ' ClinVar ', ' virtual intervention ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,369515,PA-03
"A Systems Biology Approach Using Fecal Microbiota and Metabolomics to Identify Novel Subtypes in Irritable Bowel Syndrome. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Allen Lee, MD is a gastroenterologist with advanced training in gastrointestinal motility whose research focuses on identifying abnormalities in host-microbial interactions to improve care in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Dr. Lee’s long-term career goals are to identify novel subgroups of IBS patients which inform biological responses to therapies and guide management. The proposed K23 mentored career development award includes a 3-year plan for training, didactics, and research activities that will provide Dr. Lee with the necessary skills and experience to become a successful independent investigator. Career Development: Dr. Lee will develop skills in the following four areas: 1) culture-independent approaches to study host-microbial interactions in IBS; 2) advanced biostatistical methods to study longitudinal datasets, including mixed models or generalized additive models; 3) laboratory-based translational techniques; 4) predictive analytics, such as machine learning algorithms. These training goals will directly contribute to Dr. Lee’s long-term career goals and prepare him to submit a successful R01 application. Research Context: Common treatments in diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) are effective in ≤50% patients. Additionally, there are currently no methods to identify patients more likely to respond to different treatments. The current paradigm for managing IBS patients revolves around identifying and treating the predominant symptom complexes. However, this is a hugely inefficient model and leads to frustration for both patients and health care providers. This proposal seeks to determine whether a systems biology approach, which incorporates microbiome and metabolomics data along with detailed clinical phenotype information, may identify novel subgroups that inform treatment decisions in IBS-D. Research Plan: This career development award leverages an on-going clinical trial comparing the effects of a nonabsorbable antibiotic rifaximin with a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) in IBS-D patients to identify differences in microbial community structure and function in responders vs. non-responders to therapy. Specific Aim 1 will identify fecal microbial features by 16S rRNA sequence analysis characteristic of treatment response to rifaximin or a low FODMAP diet. Specific Aim 2 will determine how treatments with rifaximin or low FODMAP diet affect the fecal metabolome, including short chain fatty acids and bile acids, in IBS-D patients. Specific Aim 3 will develop predictive models to identify subsets of IBS-D patients responsive to treatment. We will also identify risk factors for non-response to either rifaximin or low FODMAP diet. Results from this proposal will inform two future R01 proposals to validate these findings as well as to understand the mechanisms by which host-microbial interactions may mediate response to different therapies in IBS. Project Narrative Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) is a common but difficult condition to manage likely because it is a heterogeneous disorder. This research proposal seeks to determine whether patients with IBS- D can be better stratified by their fecal microbiome and microbiome-derived metabolites. Results from this proposal may lead to a paradigm change in the way that we manage and treat IBS and potentially lead to an era of precision medicine in IBS.",A Systems Biology Approach Using Fecal

"The Transporter Classification Database (TCDB) ABSTRACT  Transporters catalyze entry and exit of molecules into and out of cells and organelles. They achieve cellular homeostasis, are responsible for multidrug resistance in pathogens and tumors, and, when defective, cause dozens of important human genetic diseases. Our laboratory maintains, updates and improves the Transporter Classification Database, TCDB, which houses the Transporter Classification (TC) system, adopted officially by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB). TCDB is the internationally acclaimed, carefully annotated, universal standard for classifying and providing information about transporters and transport-related proteins in all major domains of life. It presents sequence, biochemical, physiological, pathological, structural and evolutionary data about these proteins and the transport systems they comprise. It uses a successful system of classification based on transporter class, subclass, family, subfamily, individual transport system and constituent proteins. It also includes a superfamily hyperlink.  In this competitive renewal of GM0077402, we propose to continue to expand, update, and semi-automate TCDB. Our specific aims are to (1) upgrade TCDB by characterizing and categorizing protein domains and their topologies, motifs, repeat units, functional interactions, alternative splicing and post-translational modifications, (2) expand TCDB by implementing novel pipelines for data entry that will increase the coverage of transport diversity in TCDB while describing more effectively the complexity of multicomponent transport systems, (3) enter into TCDB transporter modulators such as activators, inhibitors, drugs and xenobiotics as well as internal and external conditions that influence transporter activities, while generating an ontology to describe the effects of chemical modulators that will complement our substrate ontology, (4) incorporate into TCDB synthetic pores/channels (TC subclass 1.D), and carriers (TC subclass 2.B), (5) introduce into TCDB connections between transport and metabolism and (6) expand our plans for long-term TCDB sustainability. PROJECT NARRATIVE  TCDB is the only IUBMB-approved database providing the worldwide scientific community with systematic information about proteins that catalyze transmembrane transport. Transport proteins play critical roles in health-related issues such as personalized medicine, cancer, drug development, bacterial pathogenesis and antimicrobial resistance.

"SMART NANPs: new molecular platform for communication with human immune system and modulation of therapeutic responses Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Afonin, Kirill, A  PROJECT SUMMARY  What if healthcare providers were equipped with biocompatible, biodegradable, robust, and affordable treatment options that combine therapeutic modalities with controlled mechanisms of action? What if this versatile technology had learning capacity and could be educated to recognize patient-specific diseases and interfere with their progression by redirecting fundamental cellular processes? What if the very same formulation could offer an additional means of control over patients’ immune responses and further advance favorable therapeutic outcomes with minimal toxicities? These next generation therapies would then become a game changer in helping to prevent, detect, diagnose, and treat diseases and disabilities at their source. With the support from MIRA (R35) funding, we envision a data-driven platform, SMART NANPs (specific, modular, adjustable, reproducible, and targeted nucleic acid nanoparticles), encoded by self-assembling nucleic acids. By controlling the flow of genetic information across all forms of life, nucleic acids have become instrumental in acquiring new knowledge about major cellular processes and origins of diseases. Besides their diverse biological roles, these biopolymers can be programmed into NANPs with specified physicochemical properties and functionalities that dictate NANPs’ biological actions with endless possibilities for reprogramming cellular behavior through molecular signaling. We recently discovered that different architectural parameters and compositions of NANPs, delivered to primary human immune cells, can activate monocytes and dendritic cells to produce type I and type III interferons. This pioneering work on NANPs’ immunorecognition highlighted an unforeseen clinical application for this technology in the field of vaccines and immunotherapy. A defined structure-function relationship for any given NANP would then allow conditional actuation of its immunorecognition or any other therapeutic activity through a set of embedded architectural codes. With this notion, we introduced two orthogonal concepts of therapeutic NANPs which can be conditionally activated in human cancer cells to release pre-programmed therapeutics. By uniting these breakthroughs and other preliminary findings from my lab, as highlighted in the current application, and integrating them into a unified network of SMART NANPs with programmable control of biodistribution, immunological activity, and therapeutic modules, we will advance the current repertoire of therapies against infectious diseases and cancers (through NANP-based vaccines and immunotherapies), cardiovascular diseases (through regulated coagulation by thrombin-targeting NANPs), and address drug overdose and safety issues (through the biodegradable nature of NANPs and their controlled deactivation). To maximize the successful translation of this technology, the proposed program will employ a multidisciplinary approach that spans the fields of nucleic acid nanotechnology, immunology, drug delivery, translational oncology, and machine learning. The long-term goal of this program is to elevate SMART NANPs to the level of clinical use. Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Afonin, Kirill, A PROJECT NARRATIVE  Beyond their traditionally known roles as carriers and regulators of genetic information, nucleic acids have auspiciously emerged as versatile therapies for taking advantage of cellular pathways to drive the sensing, targeting, and silencing of a variety of diseases. With MIRA support, we will explore additional nanotechnology- based therapeutic options that enlist a biocompatible nucleic acid-encoded platform (SMART NANPs) for the controlled immunostimulation and modulation of therapeutic responses.

"Developing computational algorithms for histopathological image analysis Project Summary  Histopathology is the cornerstone of disease diagnosis and prognosis. With the advance of imaging technology, whole-slide image (WSI) scanning of tissue slides is becoming a routine clinical procedure and producing a massive amount of data that captures histopathological details in high resolution. Most current pathological image analysis methods, similar to general image analysis approaches, mainly focus on morphology features, such as tissue texture and granularity, but ignore the complex hierarchical structures of tissues. Cells are the fundamental building blocks to tissues. Different types of cells are first organized into cellular components, which together with the extracellular matrix, form different types of tissue architectures. Understanding the interactions among these different types of cells can provide critical insights into biology and disease status. However, there are some major computational challenges: (1) How to identify and classify different types of cells in tissue, (2) how to characterize the highly complex and heterogeneous spatial organization of tissue, and (3) how to integrate histopathology data with other types of data to study disease status and progression. The goal of this proposal is to develop novel computational methods to analyze histopathology image data to study disease status and progression. In order to achieve this goal, we have built a strong research team with complementary expertise in image analysis, machine learning, statistical modeling, and clinical pathology. Specifically, we will develop novel algorithms to: (1) classify different types of cells from histopathology tissue WSI scans, (2) characterize and quantify cell spatial distribution and cell-cell interactions, and (3) integrate histopathology data with other types data to study disease progression. All proposed methods were motivated by real-world biological and clinical applications across different types of diseases, such as liver diseases, infectious diseases, and cancer. If implemented successfully, the proposed study will facilitate the analysis and modeling of data generated from histopathology tissue slides to improve disease risk assessment, diagnosis, and outcome prediction.

"Clinical Research Education in Genome Science (CREiGS) Project Summary/Abstract  The sensitivity and availability of omic technologies have enabled the genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic characterization of disease phenotypes, at the tissue and even the single cell level. This has allowed development of treatments that target specific disease subtypes, most notably in cancer treatment, and thus opened up opportunities for the development of precision/personalized medicine strategies for optimizing treatments for individual patients. Thus, new genomic science educational initiatives need to be continually updated to educate the clinical and translational workforce on how to effectively interpret and apply the findings from genomics studies. Patients of providers who have participated in these educational initiatives also benefit as it allows for more rapid integration of genomic study findings into the clinical care setting. Thus, in response to PAR-19-185, we propose to develop and implement the Clinical Research Education in Genome Science (CREiGS) program that will not only focus on the analysis of genomic data, but also on gene-expression data, the integration of these two data types, as well as introductory theory and application of statistical and machine learning methods. Specifically we propose to accomplish the following specific aims: 1. Develop and successfully implement the online and in-person phases of CREiGS to increase the methodologic ingenuity by which researchers tackle important genomics-related clinical problems. 2. Establish a Diversity Recruitment External Advisory Board to ensure that the most effective strategies are employed to recruit URM doctoral students, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty from academic institutions nationwide into CREiGS. 3. Enhance the dissemination phase of CREiGS by packaging and uploading the asynchronous lectures and the online critical thinking/problem solving assessments with solutions for publicly available, online teaching resources. 4. Implement effective methods to evaluate the efficacy of CREiGS by examining:1) the participants' grasp of the CREiGS core competencies, 2) the clarity and quality of the curriculum, 3) program logistics and operation, and 4) the participants' short-term and long-term success attributed to participation in CREiGS. In summary, we posit that CREiGS will provide participants with a solid foundation in genomics science to answer complex, clinical questions. We believe that CREiGS supports the mission of the NHGRI by providing researchers with rigorous training to “accelerate medical breakthroughs that improve human health.” Project Narrative The sensitivity and availability of omic technologies have allowed for the development of treatments that target specific disease subtypes, most notably in cancer treatment, and thus opened up opportunities for the development of precision/personalized medicine strategies for optimizing treatments for individual patients.

"Mitochondrial regulation of stress reactivity in humans Chronic dysregulation of physiological systems manifests systemically as allostatic load (AL) and in abnormal stress reactivity profiles, which are features of psychopathological conditions that increase future disease risk. But the biological basis underlying inter-individual differences in stress regulation and reactivity remains unknown. Even among populations of healthy individuals exposed to standardized laboratory challenges, such as the Trier social stress test (TSST), there are substantial differences in the magnitude of responses in multiple physiological systems, including but not limited to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and cardiovascular system, metabolic changes, and immune and pro-inflammatory systems. One common factor to all stress systems is their dependence on energy supply, which fuels every aspect of the stress response including molecular, cellular, systemic and cognitive/psychological functioning. At the cellular level, energy is provided by mitochondria, unique organelles that populate the cell cytoplasm and contain their own genome, the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), that is essential to mitochondrial health. MtDNA defects cause dysregulation of multiple aspects of mitochondrial structure and function, known as mitochondrial allostatic load (MAL). Three main lines of evidence suggest that MAL contributes to AL and regulates stress responses in humans: i) we recently discovered that the mtDNA is released following psychological stress in humans (PNEC 2019), ii) experimentally-induced MAL in animals caused specific alterations in the multisystem physiological responses to psychological stress (PNAS 2015), and iii) mitochondria are the source of stress hormones, including cortisol that is synthesized in mitochondria within the adrenal glands (Nat Genetics 2012). Together, this evidence suggests that MAL may alter both baseline AL and stress reactivity profiles, potentially providing new insight into the source of interindividual differences in stress regulation and health in general. In this project, we perform the first comprehensive assessment of MAL, systemic AL, multisystem stress reactivity to a laboratory challenge (TSST) in three groups of individuals who have rare genetic mtDNA defects that selectively causes different forms of MAL and in a healthy control group. Multisystem stress biomarker profiling under fasting baseline and stress reactive conditions will provide a comprehensive test of pathways linking MAL to stress physiology in humans. The resulting high-dimensionality data will be treated using integrative data analytic approaches and classifying algorithms, including cross-validated machine learning models, to identify resting and stress-reactive biomarker signatures responsive to MAL. In parallel, assessments of executive function and key domains of psychosocial functioning including mood, stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and well-being will contribute to provide a comprehensive picture of novel mitochondrial psychobiological pathways. NARRATIVE There are large unexplained inter-individual differences in systemic allostatic load and stress reactivity, which may in part be explained by mitochondria. Here we study the effects of chronic dysregulation of mitochondrial function – mitochondrial allostatic load (MAL) – on multisystem stress regulation in humans. This project will establish the influence of MAL on baseline AL as well as multisystem stress reactivity profiles, defining novel psychobiological pathways by which mitochondria may contribute to the maintenance of health and resilience, and to disease risk.",Mitochondrial regulation of stress reactivity in humans,10145795,R01MH122706,"['Adrenal Glands ', ' Adrenals ', ' suprarenal gland ', '

"Deep learning models to predict primitive streak formation in human development Project Summary Congenital birth defects affect an estimated 3% of live births. To develop effective treatment strategies, a thorough understanding of early human development is necessary. Our lab recently developed and in vitro model of human gastrulation, the process by which the three germ layers (endoderm, ectoderm, mesoderm) are formed around week three of gestation. This so-called “gastruloid” model is formed by treating human embryonic stem cells with purified differentiation factors that cause them to self-organize into a pattern resembling a gastrulating embryo. One of the key events during this process is formation of the primitive streak—a migration of specialized mesenchymal stem cells along the embryonic midline that will form all mesodermal tissues including the heart, lungs, blood vessels, and cells of the circulatory system. At the same time, cells on the periphery of the embryo begin forming extraembryonic mesoderm, which will ultimately become placental tissue. Despite the critical importance of these cell fate changes, it is currently unclear which population of embryonic stem cells will differentiate to form primitive streak or extraembryonic mesoderm and how these cell fate decisions are determined. The research objective of this fellowship proposal is to understand when and how human stem cells differentiate into primitive streak and extraembryonic mesoderm during gastrulation. My overall approach is to use time-lapse fluorescence imaging to monitor differentiation decisions in real time and at single-cell solution. I will then employ a specialized type of machine learning known as deep learning to accurately track the movement and signaling behavior of individual cells. Next, I will develop a computational model that uses a cell’s image patterns to accurately predict how each cell “chooses” between differentiation fates. The two specific research aims are: 1) to identify the subpopulation of human embryonic stem cells that will commit to primitive streak; and 2) to determine the combination of intracellular and extracellular signaling events that govern differentiation to extraembryonic mesoderm. The proposed work includes novel experimental procedures (specifically, real-time imaging of gastruloids formation in Aim 1) as well as unique neural network architectures that accurately predict binary cell fate outcomes of individual stem cells based on their signaling history. These methods will be generalizable to other biological systems. The proposed training plan focuses on generating and applying cutting-edge statistical methods tasked with full single-cell feature data incorporation in order to make robust, theoretically and biologically sound predictions about human stem cell fate decisions. A better understanding of early human development will inform future cellular therapies to prevent and treat congenital birth defects. To support my training, I have assembled a strong mentorship team with expertise in stem cell biology, live-cell imaging, machine learning methodologies, and causal inference. Project Narrative Early human development is a crucial time period in which the structures of primitive streak and extraembryonic mesoderm are formed and errors in cellular differentiation can have dire consequences. This fellowship proposal seeks to advance our fundamental understanding of how human embryonic stem cells decide specific differentiation fates using advanced machine learning methodologies. The findings from this work will help develop future stem cell therapies for treatment of birth defects and miscarriages in early primitive streak and extraembryonic mesoderm formation, ultimately

"Development of neurologic itch signature Abstract: Chronic itch is a global health problem affecting tens of millions of people worldwide. However, there is no objective biomarker to assess itch. Since itch results from activity in brain circuits through the participation of many brain regions, we suggest developing specific brain biomarkers to assess the disease states and treatment effects using functional brain imaging and machine learning. Developments of biomarkers are one of the great advances of modern allopathic medicine. In itch treatment, assessment of itch is an important indicator in understanding the progress of chronic itch and treatment effect. Currently, itch assessment is based almost exclusively on patients' self-reports, which is inherently limited by the complex relationship between biological pruriceptive (itch-related) processes and patients' verbal or written descriptions of itch. In particular, self-report is not applicable for people who have a limited capacity to report itch such as infants, very young children, and elderly people with cognitive impairments. Addressing chronic itch is becoming a central morbidity in many dermatological diseases and a primary endpoint in clinical trials. Therefore, there is a great need to develop a reliable biomarker for itch. Itch-related neural signals are a fundamental element of the itch sensation. Measuring these signals can be a reliable biomarker for itch. Recent advancement of brain imaging combined with machine learning algorithms has enabled development of brain activity-based biomarkers to assess various mental activities and brain functions. This advancement, together with ongoing progress of low- cost & high-performance MRI, will expand the feasibility of practical use of fMRI in medicine. A brain activity- based biomarker for itch (i.e., Neurologic Itch Signature, NIS) may dramatically improve the quality of diagnoses, treatments and clinical trials. Moreover, the NIS can be a promising biomarker for itch-related processing in the brain, which enables to better understand the pathophysiology of chronic itch. The aim of our research proposal is to develop the NIS. In particular, we will demonstrate (1) that the NIS will selectively respond to itch (i.e., unresponsive to pain) and (2) that the NIS can predict not only an existence of itch but also itch intensity, as these are fundamental requirements of biomarker for itch. To achieve this goal, we will obtain datasets of brain activity during various intensities of itch and pain stimuli and resting condition by using functional MRI (fMRI), and identify a characteristic brain activity pattern for itch (i.e., the NIS) by analyzing the datasets using a machine learning algorithm. We will test whether the created NIS can predict itch and severity of itch without prior information.

"A Feasibility Study of a High-Throughput Live-Cell Microscopy Design for Visualizing Viral Particle Action and Nano-Carrier Delivery Performance Project Summary/Abstract Decades of basic research have afforded a general picture for how a viral particle may approach a cell, be internalized by the cell, and hijack the cell to produce more progenitors. The accumulated knowledge, in turn, has allowed one to formulate specific mechanistic questions. For instance, why would a particular mutation in a virus make it more effective in infecting a live cell? Is it because the mutation makes the virus stay on the cell surface longer (on time) but exhibiting the same cell-internalization propensity, or is it because the mutation makes it easier for the virus to invade the cell while the off time remains the same? Where inside a cell and when does a viral particle escape an endosomal enclosure and/or shed its capsid to release its genetic material? By analogy, similar questions can be formulated in designing nanoparticle-based drug delivery vessels. Many ingenious experiments using a diverse array of biochemical and biological tools have been devised to address them, and the insights have led to translational research that has direct therapeutic impacts. A direct observation and recording of these dynamical events that a viral particle may exhibit in its cell-invasion and multiplication cycle could potentially offer much more. Recently, our laboratory put forward a proof-of-principle imaging platform that allows one to do just that: While an integrated two-photon laser-scanning microscope continuously provides 3D sections of the environmental context of a moving virus-like nanoparticle, the nanoparticle is tracked in 3D. This is performed by moving the sample in order to keep the particle at the center of a microscope objective focus with a super-resolution localization precision (~10 nm) in all three dimensions and at a 10-microsecond time resolution. Even for events as simple as a virus-like nanoparticle approaching and landing on a cell, this prototype multiresolution microscope has allowed us to uncover that, unexpectedly, a virus-like particle tends to slow down significantly before its landing on a cell surface. While the prototype instrumentation demonstrates that direct 3D high-resolution visualization could indeed provide uniquely new information that has been inaccessible using conventional methods, its trajectory throughput is too low to be of widespread practical use. This developmental project is intended to test whether a new microscopy design would make this approach higher throughput. This is to be achieved by a new instrumentation design and a machine learning computational backend for dynamic content filtering. Quantitative measures for benchmarking and feasibility testing are also described. If feasible, the community would have a completely new and practical way of looking at viral particle actions and nano-carrier delivery performances. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to evaluate a new live-cell microscopy instrumentation design, intended for practical applications in areas such as the basic research of virology and drug delivery. The design leverages the advantages of concurrent 3D imaging at three different optical resolutions where the data acquisition is assisted by machine learning. If feasible, this high throughput yet high content instrumentation design would provide a completely new way of visualizing single viral particle actions or individual nano-carrier delivery performances— in real time with 3D contextual fidelity at a particle-localization precision as high as ~10 nm in all three axes with 10-μs time resolution.",A Feasibility Study of a High-Throughput Live-Cell Microscopy Design for Visualizing Viral Particle Action and Nano-Carrier Delivery Performance,10193517,R21EB031374,"['Alpha Particles ', ' Alpha Particle Radiation ', ' Alpha Radiation ', ' α Particles ', ' Behavior ', ' Capsid ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Exhibits ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' instrumentation ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Methods ', ' Microscopy ', ' Microtubules ', ' Micro-tubule ', ' Motion ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Endosomes ', ' Receptosomes ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' statistics ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' virology ', ' Virus ', ' Measures ', ' Drug Delivery Systems ', ' Drug Delivery ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Microscope ', ' Area ', ' Diffuse ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Genetic Materials ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Location ', ' Viral ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' interest ', ' particle ', ' Performance ', ' trait ', ' Laser Scanning Microscopy ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Cell surface ', ' Sampling ', ' 3-D Imaging ', ' 3D imaging ', ' Three-Dimensional Imaging ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' virus-like nanoparticles ', ' viruslike particle ', ' Virus-like particle ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Invaded ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' optical imaging ', ' optic imaging ', ' two-photon ', ' 2-photon ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' computer aided ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' nanocarrier ', ' nano carrier ', ' nanoparticle ', ' nano particle ', ' nano-sized particle ', ' nanosized particle ', ' Coupling ', ' data acquisition ', ' practical application ', ' application in practice ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' progenitor ', ' prototype ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' imaging platform ', ' live cell microscopy ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' neural network ', ' Visualization ', ' data streams ', ' feasibility testing ', ' ']",NIBIB,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,363354,NJ-12
"Next-generation, pathway-specific, polygenic risk scores PROJECT SUMMARY The key appeal of polygenic risk scores (PRS) is the provision of individual-level estimates of genetic liability to complex disease. These proxies of genetic liability enable a raft of applications across clinical and basic research settings. However, while PRS are set to play a pivotal role in the future of biomedical research, their present formulation is suboptimal since it fails to directly account for substructure in genetic disease risk. The overarching goal of our proposal is to introduce a new generation of pathway-specific PRS, informed by biological function. Rather a single genome-wide PRS for each individual, they will have a set of k PRS over k pathways. Pathways will be defined according to multiscale integration of ‘omics data, exploiting co-expression networks, the transcriptome and the epigenome. The key deliverable from this project will be the production of a powerful and comprehensive pathway-specific PRS computational tool, PRSet, informed by biological function. The rationale is that PRS calculated for individuals by aggregating the effects of all risk variants genome-wide, results in a loss of vital individual-level information. Providing pathway-specific estimates of genetic liability, computed in a scalable, statistically rigorous way, informed by latest multi-omic data, could enable researchers to better decompose heterogenous complex disease, identify key pathways that explain overlap or differences among disorders, and explain problems of portability of PRS between and within populations. Applying our pathway-specific PRS tool, we seek to stratify patients into more homogenous subgroups by their liability over key pathways. We will use PRSet for stratification in three ways: (i) stratifying within SCZ/BiP, testing if liability over different pathways forms multiple routes to disease, (ii) differentiating between SCZ and BiP, testing if key pathways differentiate these highly overlapping disorders, (iii) testing whether variation in treatment response can be explained by pathway liability. Such stratification could help explain past successes, failures and adverse-effects in clinical trials, and provide new therapeutic targets tailored to subsets of patients. Our proposal is significant because the burgeoning application of PRS means that any advance in the PRS approach will have immediate, high impact across psychiatric research. Pathway-specific PRS could open-up routes to hypotheses that cannot be answered by genome-wide PRS. If PRSet reveals that genetic liability is more stratified than presently modelled, then this would call for a focus on pathways and their multi-omic integration, paving a new path towards precision medicine. Our proposal is innovative because we develop the first pathway-specific, function-informed, PRS tool, we propose that disease risk may be influenced by multiple genetic liabilities, and we stratify patients according to pathway-specific genetic risk for the first time. In conclusion, our proposal delivers a tool for the field to perform powerful pathway PRS analyses, better understand genetic liability to disease, and which may offer a more direct route to precision medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are set to play a key role in advancing our understanding of the etiology and treatment of disease. While the application of genome-wide PRS is burgeoning across biomedical research, we propose that pathway-specific PRS have even greater potential to provide etiological insights and will help pave the way to precision medicine. Here we introduce a new generation of pathway-specific polygenic risk scores, informed by biological function, and deliver a comprehensive computational tool for their analysis, applying it to perform patient stratification in schizophrenia and bipolar disorders.","Next-generation, pathway-specific, polygenic risk scores",10136725,R01MH122866,"['Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease susceptibility ', ' Diathesis ', ' liability to disease ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Production ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Generations ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Link ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Intuition ', ' Individual ', ' Biochemical Pathway ', ' Metabolic Networks ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' genetic etiology ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Complex ', ' Route ', ' Location ', ' success ', ' trait ', ' Proxy ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' functional genomics ', ' portability ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Genomics ', ' BMI ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Stratification ', ' Subgroup ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' genome wide association study ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' next generation ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' user-friendly ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' new drug target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new therapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' risk variant ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk allele ', ' risk gene ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk loci ', ' risk locus ', ' epigenome ', ' rare variant ', ' rare allele ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' individualized prevention ', ' personalized prevention ', ' precision prevention ', ' personalized therapeutic ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' patient stratification ', ' stratified patient ', ' Formulation ', ' Genotype-Tissue Expression Project ', ' GTEx ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' genetic condition ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Multiomic Data ', ' multiple omic data ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' polygenic risk score ', ' ']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,635256,NY-13
"Characterizing Shared Features of Innate Immune Cells across Neurodegenerative Diseases using Single Cell Expression and Chromatin Accessibility Data With few effective interventions available and over 10 million patients affected, neurodegenerative diseases are an area of intense basic science and clinical research. Inspired by Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) that have identified many risk variants linked to immune genes, neurobiologists are just beginning to understand the inflammatory basis for neurodegeneration. Across degenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (MS), computational techniques applied to single cell datasets are identifying the role of immune cells in driving pathological changes in the brain. For instance, recent single cell expression studies in AD have identified a novel type of Disease Associated Microglia (DAM) associated with the disease. Preliminary analysis I performed on single cell expression data produced from retinal tissue of patients suffering from Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) recapitulated this DAM phenotype in AMD- derived microglia. Furthermore, analysis revealed that AMD-derived astrocytes drive neovascularization, a pathologic hallmark of AMD, through the increased expression of VEGF. These findings imply that neurodegeneration and pathologic changes in AMD are driven by innate immune cells, and, further, that these innate immune cell functions may be similar across neurodegenerative diseases. I hypothesize that innate immune cell function and regulation that drives pathology is shared across neurodegenerative conditions. To identify these shared features, I will design and apply novel computational algorithms to single cell datasets from multiple neurodegenerative diseases - AMD, AD and MS - to elucidate the role of innate immune cells across conditions. In aim 1, I will apply a coarse graining algorithm, Diffusion Condensation, that clusters cells at all levels of granularity to identify pathologic microglial and astrocyte subsets in single cell expression data produced from retinal tissue of patients with AMD. I will further apply this technique to subset these innate immune cells in publicly available single cell expression datasets in MS and AD in order to identify gene modules shared among microglia and astrocytes across diseases. In aim 2, I will apply a multi-modal data alignment algorithm, Harmonic Alignment, that integrates single cell expression and chromatin accessibility data to produce a rich, joint expression and accessibility profile for every cell to identify epigenetic regulators of expression. When used to integrate datasets derived from AMD patients and controls, this algorithm will be able to identify chromatin regions and candidate transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes key to microglial and astrocytic dysfunction. By overlapping our knowledge of GWAS risk alleles from AMD, AD and MS, on top of predicted epigenetic regulators of innate immune cell dysfunction in a neurodegenerative context, I hope to be able to elucidate the effect of risk variants in inducing disease in a cell-type specific manner. These projects will help identify shared genomic and regulatory mechanisms in innate immune cells across neurodegenerative diseases and will help identify common pathways for future therapeutic development. In order to understand the inflammatory basis of neurodegenerative diseases, single cell expression and chromatin accessibility datasets need to be met with novel computational strategies. Our machine learning techniques will aim to understand the shared genomic and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms of microglia and astrocytes in different neurodegenerative contexts: Multiple Sclerosis, Alzheimer’s Disease and Age-related Macular Degeneration. This proposal will identify specific genomic and epigenomic targets unique to innate immune cells shared across diseases that can aid in the development of immune-modulating

"Automated data curation to ensure model credibility in the Vascular Model Repository Three-dimensional anatomic modeling and simulation (3D M&S) in cardiovascular (CV) disease have become a crucial component of treatment planning, medical device design, diagnosis, and FDA approval. Comprehensive, curated 3-D M&S databases are critical to enable grand challenges, and to advance model reduction, shape analysis, and deep learning for clinical application. However, large-scale open data curation involving 3-D M&S present unique challenges; simulations are data intensive, physics-based models are increasingly complex and highly resolved, heterogeneous solvers and data formats are employed by the community, and simulations require significant high-performance computing resources. Manually curating a large open-data repository, while ensuring the contents are verified and credible, is therefore intractable. We aim to overcome these challenges by developing broadly applicable automated curation data science to ensure model credibility and accuracy in 3-D M&S, leveraging our team’s expertise in CV simulation, uncertainty quantification, imaging science, and our existing open data and open source projects. Our team has extensive experience developing and curating open data and software resources. In 2013, we launched the Vascular Model Repository (VMR), providing 120 publicly-available datasets, including medical image data, anatomic vascular models, and blood flow simulation results, spanning numerous vascular anatomies and diseases. The VMR is compatible with SimVascular, the only fully open source platform providing state-of-the-art image-based blood flow modeling and analysis capability to the CV simulation community. We propose that novel curation science will enable the VMR to rapidly intake new data while automatically assessing model credibility, creating a unique resource to foster rigor and reproducibility in the CV disease community with broad application in 3D M&S. To accomplish these goals, we propose three specific aims: 1) Develop and validate automated curation methods to assess credibility of anatomic patient-specific models built from medical image data, 2) Develop and validate automated curation methods to assess credibility of 3D blood flow simulation results, 3) Disseminate the data curation suite and expanded VMR. The proposed research is significant and innovative because it will 1) enable rapid expansion of the repository by limiting curator intervention during data intake, leveraging compatibility with SimVascular, 2) increase model credibility in the CV simulation community, 3) apply novel supervised and unsupervised approaches to evaluate anatomic model fidelity, 4) leverage reduced order models for rapid assessment of complex 3D data. This project assembles a unique team of experts in cardiovascular simulation, the developers of SimVascular and creator of the VMR, a professional software engineer, and radiology technologists. We will build upon our successful track record of launching and supporting open source and open data resources to ensure success. Data curation science for 3D M&S will have direct and broad impacts in other physiologic systems and to ultimately impact clinical care in cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular anatomic models and blood flow simulations are increasingly used for personalized surgical planning, medical device design, and the FDA approval process. We propose to develop automated data curation science to rapidly assess credibility of anatomic models and 3D simulation data, which present unique challenges for large-scale data curation.

"Outcomes for CLL patients treated with novel therapy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT We have recently conducted and published a game changing phase 3 clinical North American Intergroup (NAIG) trial (E1912) for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) therapy which tested a combination of Ibrutinib and Rituximab (IR) vs. the prior gold standard chemoimmunotherapy (CIT): fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR). This trial showed that both progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) are superior with IR and subsequently was the driving factor in FDA approval for frontline use of IR in progressive previously untreated CLL in the spring of 2020. While our work revealed distinct clinical advantages to non-CIT approaches, a number of new questions have emerged with respect to how best apply this advance. The durability of the response to first-line ibrutinib-based therapy is highly variable and requires indefinite treatment exposing patients to the risk of chronic toxicity and selective pressure that may foster resistant clones. The ability to more accurately predict the durability of response could help identify patients more likely to have long term remission with ibrutinib therapy (candidates for time limited therapy) and those more likely to have a short duration of response whom may benefit from intensive combination therapy with alternative novel agents. We wish to develop a unique model(s) incorporating multiple key prognostic factors that will have a high level of confidence in predicting patient outcomes to novel therapy combination. Our initial study on patients treated on IR arm of E1912 found a subset of patients on the IR arm with evidence for emerging mutations and changes in their clonal architecture predicting relapse. The exact mechanisms for relapse need to be defined as we predict that these patients will be difficult to treat and alternative strategies needed. We found that IR therapy was uniquely able to reactivate the previously exhausted T cell killing activity directed against the leukemic CLL cells. While we have some information on the mechanism(s) for this, much remains to be learned and also the exact timing for achieving the maximal restoration of T cell function or fitness. This beneficial impact on T cell function will also be studied as it relates to generation of CAR T cells as these cells are powerful inducers of immunotherapy which is itself capable of removing residual CLL tumor burden. We hypothesize that the outcome of the studies will add significant and important information on how to best select non-chemotherapy for CLL patients and also the treatment impact on the immune system. These goals will be accomplished through the following specific aims: Aim 1: Develop an Integrated Model to Predict Clinical Outcomes for CLL Patients Treated with Novel Agents. Aim 2: Determine the Genetic, Epigenetic and Transcriptomic Changes in Ibrutinib Treated CLL. Aim 3: Characterize the Impact of Ibrutinib Treatment on T-cell Fitness to Guide Application of Immunotherapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE These scientific studies assess important ways that Ibrutinib-based therapy for upfront therapy of CLL patients can be evaluated adding important decision parameters on who would benefit the most from this approach, strategies on how to best treat refractory or relapsed patients and on the most opportune times to utilize blood T cells for immunotherapy. In total this collective analysis will provide critical insights on this therapeutic approach and in this fashion improve the health of individuals with this disease.",Outcomes for CLL patients

"Systems biology frameworks to unravel mechanisms driving complex disorders Project Summary/Abstract This application proposes a training program to integrate the PI, Dr. Varadan's previous research efforts in informatics and machine learning into investigations pertaining to the etiology and progression of Barrett's Esophagus, a gastrointestinal disorder of significant public health interest. Much of Dr. Varadan's previous research has involved developing intelligent algorithms and informatics approaches to decode the interconnections within complex biological systems, with only a basic understanding of the clinical needs and complexities involved in translational research. The proposed project would provide a broad and in-depth mentored experience focused on clinical and biological aspects of Barrett's Esophagus, as well as added knowledge in the use of preclinical model systems to investigate biological mechanisms. The overall goal is to expand the PI's experience and training in the design and conduct of translational studies focused on gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. This objective will be achieved through a combination of didactic and research activities conducted under an exceptional mentoring team of translational researchers at Case Western Reserve University, spanning achievements across clinical management of GI disorders, molecular genetics and inflammatory processes associated with diseases of the gut. Accordingly, this proposal leverages Dr. Varadan's computational background to address an urgent and unmet need within the biomedical research community to develop reliable analytic approaches that can quantify signaling network activities in individual biological samples by integrating multi-omics measurements. We recently conceived a systems biology computational framework, InFlo, which integrates molecular profiling data to decode the functional states of cellular/molecular processes underpinning complex human diseases. Barrett's esophagus is one such complex disease gaining increasing importance to public health, as it is the known precursor to the deadly cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma. Given that the mechanisms underlying the etiology and pathogenesis of Barrett's Esophagus remain elusive, a major objective of this proposal is to employ the InFlo framework combined molecular profiles derived from primary tissue cohorts, in vitro and in vivo model systems to establish the molecular roadmap of BE pathogenesis and disease recurrence, thus elucidating unifying mechanisms underlying this disease. This systems biology approach would enable the development of evidence-based, diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers for Barrett's esophagus and inform preventive strategies within at-risk populations. Project Narrative This proposal details a novel systems biology approach to enable seamless integration of patient molecular data to decipher the mechanisms underlying complex human diseases. Using this novel integrative analytics approach, we propose to resolve the molecular basis for the development and recurrence of Barrett's Esophagus, a disease with significant public health importance, since it is a known precursor to a lethal esophageal cancer and the mechanisms underpinning this disease remain largely unknown. The findings from our proposed research will enable the development of new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and will also inform preventive strategies in high-risk patient populations.",Systems biology frameworks to unravel mechanisms driving complex disorders,10086862,K25DK115904,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Award ', ' Barrett Esophagus ', ' Barrett Syndrome ', ' Barrett Ulcer ', ' Columnar Epithelial-Lined Lower Esophagus ', ' Columnar-Lined Esophagus ', ' esophageal intestinal metaplasia ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' cell culture ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Esophagitis ', ' Esophagus ', ' Exhibits ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Gastrointestinal Diseases ', ' gastrointestinal disorder ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Interleukin-1 beta ', ' Beta Proprotein Interleukin 1 ', ' IL-1 beta ', ' IL-1 β ', ' IL-1-b ', ' IL-1β ', ' IL1-Beta ', ' IL1-β ', ' IL1B Protein ', ' IL1F2 ', ' IL1β ', ' Interleukin 1beta ', ' Interleukin-1β ', ' Preinterleukin 1 Beta ', ' Maps ', ' Mentors ', ' Transgenic Mice ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Mucous Membrane ', ' Mucosa ', ' Mucosal Tissue ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' stem cells ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Stomach ', ' gastric ', ' Systems Analysis ', ' Systems Analyses ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' Competence ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' career ', ' genetic manipulation ', ' gene manipulation ', ' genetically manipulate ', ' genetically perturb ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant -

"REGULATORS OF EPIDERMAL GENE EXPRESSION REGULATORS OF EPIDERAL GENE EXPRESSION  PROJECT SUMMARY  DNA motifs bind transcription factors (TFs) that control gene expression in normal and diseased skin. AR45192 recently mapped the enhancers and promoters that are sequentially activated during epidermal differentiation, and found them enriched for 15 conserved DNA motif combinations, or DNA motif “grammars”. This suggested that these grammars, acting through recruitment of motif-binding TFs, may encode the DNA sequence logic that coordinates the temporal and spatial induction of early and late epidermal differentiation genes. AR45192 also found that these grammars were recurrently altered by single nucleotide polymorphisms (eSNPs, for “expression SNPs”) linked by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to skin diseases characterized by disrupted epidermal differentiation, including cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). This suggests that newly identified DNA motif grammars may control differentiation and that their disruption may contribute to disease pathogenesis.  Aim I will test the hypothesis that specific DNA motif grammars control the physiologic activation of differentiation genes necessary for normal epidermal function. First, it will define the temporal activity of hundreds of examples of each grammar in early and late differentiation within intact epidermis. Second, it will quantitate epidermal differentiation gene expression and barrier function in isogenic epidermal tissues in which a subset of grammars have been altered by gene-editing. Aim I is designed to characterize the actions of newly identified DNA motif grammars in epidermal differentiation.  Aim II will test the hypothesis that SCC risk eSNPs residing within epidermal differentiation motif grammars alter gene expression in a way that enhances cancer progression. First, it will define SCC eSNP impacts on gene expression in normal epidermis with a goal to understanding the altered target genes, and their biologic functions, that predispose to SCC risk. Second, it will quantitatively assess the impact of these SCC risk eSNPs, singly and in combination, on neoplastic progression of epidermal neoplasia in vivo. Aim II is designed to define the impact of regulatory DNA variants on epidermal gene expression and disease progression.  This AR45192 competing renewal will characterize the role of newly identified regulatory DNA grammars in epidermal homeostasis and neoplastic progression. RELEVANCE  Abnormal differentiation is a hallmark of common skin diseases, such as epidermal cancers, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and certain ichthyoses. Transcription factors (TFs) bind DNA motifs in enhancers to control differentiation gene expression in skin and other tissues. Characterizing the patterns of normal and disease-linked DNA sequence motifs that control epidermal differentiation may be of broad utility in the future treatment and prevention of skin disorders. REGULATORS OF EPIDERAL GENE EXPRESSION  Project Narrative The control of gene expression determines the health or disease of human tissues, including skin. Systematic definition of the regulatory DNA motif combinations in homeostasis and early cancer progression is designed to provide information to advance human health for skin and other tissues. 1",REGULATORS OF EPIDERMAL GENE EXPRESSION,10107766,R01AR045192,"['Dependovirus ', ' Adeno-Associated Viruses ', ' Dependoparvovirus ', ' adeno associated virus group ', ' Affect ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Squamous cell carcinoma ', ' Epidermoid Carcinoma ', ' Planocellular Carcinoma ', ' Squamous Carcinoma ', ' Squamous Cell Epithelioma ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Atopic Dermatitis ', ' Atopic Eczema ', ' Atopic Neurodermatitis ', ' Disseminated Neurodermatitis ', ' allergic dermatitis ', ' allergic eczema ', ' Diploidy ', ' Diploid ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Epidermis ', ' Future ', ' Gene Activation ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Differentiated Gene ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybrids ', ' Ichthyoses ', ' keratinocyte ', ' Kinetics ', ' Logic ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neoplasms ', ' neoplasia ', ' neoplastic growth ', ' Proteins ', ' Psoriasis ', ' psoriasiform ', ' psoriatic ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Natural regeneration ', ' Regeneration ', ' regenerate ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' skin disorder ', ' Cutaneous Disorder ', ' Dermatoses ', ' Skin Diseases ', ' Skin Diseases and Manifestations ', ' cutaneous disease ', ' dermal disease ', ' dermal disorder ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Generations ', ' Enhancers ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' tumor progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Link ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Genetic ', ' Reporter ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' human tissue ', ' Pattern ', ' Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma ', ' Epidermoid Skin Carcinoma ', ' skin squamous cell carcinoma ', ' bioengineered tissue ', ' engineered tissue ', ' Tissue Engineering ', ' cutaneous tissue ', ' Skin Tissue ', ' Prevention ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' single nucleotide variant ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Genomics ', ' gene induction ', ' Skin ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' DNA Binding Interaction ', ' DNA bound ', ' DNA Binding ', ' keratinocyte differentiation ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' genome wide association study ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' human disease ', ' ATAC-seq ', ' ATACseq ', ' skin barrier ', ' cutaneous barrier ', ' dermal barrier ', ' epidermal barrier ', ' Knock-in ', ' knockin ', ' recruit ', ' neural network algorithm ', ' ']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,459691,CA-18
"A novel method for volumetric oxygen mapping in living retina PROJECT SUMMARY It is widely accepted that oxygen deficiency is a culprit and a marker of several major retinal diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma etc. However, it remains to be extremely challenging to measure oxygen in vivo in the eye, and no tools currently exist that can provide 3D oxygen distributions in the retina with high spatial resolution at appropriate imaging speeds. The goal of this project is to overcome these limitations and develop a new optical imaging technique for volumetric oxygen mapping in retina. Our approach will leverage the recently developed potent oxygen probes (such as Oxyphor 2P), whose phosphorescence decay times serve as quantitative markers of local oxygen partial pressures (pO2) in living tissues. To enable volumetric imaging with high throughput, we propose to develop a novel imaging instrument, termed oblique scanning laser ophthalmoscope (oSLO). oSLO is based on the concept of single lens scanned light sheet microscopy and enables volumetric phosphorescence lifetime imaging without time- consuming plane-by-plane pixel-wise sectioning. Our new method should be able to achieve 10 kilohertz voxel rate that is three orders of magnitude higher than the current state-of-the-art two-photon phosphorescence lifetime microscopy (2PLM). In this project we will: (Aim 1) develop a phosphorescence lifetime-based oSLO for volumetric pO2 mapping in living retina in mouse. The new design will allow parallel detection of signals at depth from each scanned location, so that the need in conventional depth sectioning is eliminated and imaging throughput is greatly increased. We will (Aim 2) dynamically image responses of retina and choroid to systemic hypoxia challenge using Oxyphor 2P. We will (Aim 3) then bridge oSLO measurements and label-free applications by multimodal imaging with visible light optical coherence tomography (vis-OCT). Using vascular pO2 as the ground-truth, we will develop a deep spectral training (DSL) algorithm to supervise the inverse calculation of vis-OCT for robust and reliable label-free retinal oximetry. This study will enable the first direct quantitative imaging of interactions between the two circulatory systems in retina (i.e. retinal and choroidal circulation), providing unprecedented information about retinal oxygen supply. IMPACT ON PUBLIC HEALTH: Successful completion of this program will deliver a new ground-breaking methodology for mapping oxygen in the retina that will greatly improve our understanding of retinal diseases. NARRATIVE Oxygen is essential in the retina, and the deficiency of oxygen is a culprit in a broad spectrum of retinal diseases. However, it remains challenging to measure oxygen in vivo in the eye. This multidisciplinary proposal is to develop a disruptive imaging method to provide unprecedented volumetric oxygen mapping in living mouse retina, as well as a deep learning method, to translate our oxygen measurements into label-free retinal oximetry for future clinical applications.",A novel method for volumetric oxygen mapping in living retina,10098478,R01EY032163,"['Affect ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Blood capillaries ', ' capillary ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Choroid ', ' Diabetic Retinopathy ', ' Dyes ', ' Coloring Agents ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Future ', ' Glaucoma ', ' glaucomatous ', ' Goals ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Microscopy ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Nobel Prize ', ' Ophthalmoscopy ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Oxygen ', ' O element ', ' O2 element ', ' Partial Pressure ', ' Pathology ', ' phosphorescence ', ' Physiology ', ' Public Health ', ' Retina ', ' Retinal Diseases ', ' Retinal Disorder ', ' retina disease ', ' retina disorder ', ' retinopathy ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Supervision ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' Fluorescence Angiography ', ' Mediating ', ' Photons ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Ophthalmoscopes ', ' Funduscopes ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Training ', ' Blood flow ', ' Hypoxia ', ' Hypoxic ', ' Oxygen Deficiency ', ' Visible Radiation ', ' Visible Light ', ' Visible Light Radiation ', ' Age related macular degeneration ', ' Age-Related Maculopathy ', ' age related macular dystrophy ', ' senile macular disease ', ' Measurement ', ' Cell Respiration ', ' Cellular Respiration ', ' aerobic metabolism ', ' aerobic respiration ', ' oxidative metabolism ', ' Metabolic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scanning ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Location ', ' Vascular System ', ' Oximetry ', ' Oxygen saturation measurement ', ' American ', ' retina circulation ', ' success ', ' choroidal circulation ', ' porphyrin a ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Fundus ', ' response ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Device ', ' multi-modal imaging ', ' multi-modality imaging ', ' multimodality imaging ', ' Multimodal Imaging ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Pathologic ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' optical imaging ', ' optic imaging ', ' two-photon ', ' 2-photon ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Consumption ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' adaptive optics ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' learning network ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' human imaging ', ' clinical translation ', ' Inhalation ', ' Inhaling ', ' novel imaging technique ', ' retinal imaging ', ' retina imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' two photon microscopy ', ' 2-photon microscopy ', ' two photon excitation microscopy ', ' algorithm training ', ' ']",NEI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,552744,MD-07
"Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1 Project Summary The Cys2His2 zinc finger DNA-binding domain is the most common domain in human yet the DNA-binding specificities for the great majority of these proteins remain undefined. Mutations in many of these domains, both with and without known DNA-binding data, have been linked to a host of diseases from Alzheimers (REST) to Cancer (e.g. Slug, WT1, CTCF). Therefore, the characterization of these proteins holds great value. Unfortunately common methodologies used to determine the DNA-binding specificity of transcription factors have failed to address the zinc finger, at least in part because of an inability to fully define the large target specificities required of the average mammalian zinc finger protein. Even when ChIP-Seq data exists it is limited because the size of the genome does not allow us to capture the full binding potential of a factor that could offer a ≥21bp target sequence. As a result, without a comprehensive understanding of a protein’s binding potential, SNPs across the genome will continue to represent potential binding sites that we are unable to predict. In sum, decades of research have enlightened our understanding of this domain but we are still in the dark when it comes to its function as a transcription factors. Recently we have taken an alternative approach to define this domain, demonstrating that a synthetic, one-by-one screen of individual zinc fingers allows us to predict the specificity of multi-fingered proteins with similar or greater accuracy than all prior prediction algorithms. However, this approach fails to take into consideration the influences that adjacent fingers have on one another. We have produced the equivalent of a comprehensive snapshot of what a zinc finger is capable of in just one of many potential contextual environments. Here we propose to scale this approach and screen the zinc finger under an inclusive set of contextual environments. We will consider the most common direct and indirect influences on adjacent finger binding as well as factors that impact the geometry with which the zinc fingers engage the DNA. We will use these results to provide a complete picture of how adjacent zinc fingers determine their specificity and by scaffolding these two-fingered models, predict and design the specificity of large, multi-fingered proteins. In this way, we will define a multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity that allows us to predict all zinc finger DNA-binding specificities, how any neighbor finger context would modify this specificity, and the factors that result in adjacent finger incompatibility and loss of DNA-binding function. We will apply this model to predict the specificity of all human zinc finger proteins, validate these predictions through in vivo characterization of an informed set of transcription factors, and test predicted mechanisms of multi-fingered binding with designer, artificial factors. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the ZF domain is the most common in human yet it remains largely uncharacterized. A holistic understanding of ZF function will provide insight into how ZF mutations are related to disease and allow us to predict harmful binding sites due to SNPs across the genome.",Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1,10093062,R01GM118851,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Charge ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Environment ', ' Fingers ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybrids ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Libraries ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Zinc Fingers ', ' Zinc Finger Domain ', ' Zinc Finger Motifs ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' Distal ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Protein Binding ', ' bound protein ', ' slug ', ' Exposure to ', ' Reporter ', ' scaffolding ', ' scaffold ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' exhaustion ', ' System ', ' Structure ', ' WAGR ', ' WT1 ', ' WT1 Gene Product ', ' WT1 Protein ', ' WT33 ', ' Wilms Tumor 1 ', ' Wilms tumor suppressor WT1 ', ' WT1 gene ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' model design ', ' DNA Binding Interaction ', ' DNA bound ', ' DNA Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' Systems Biology ', ' DNA-Binding Protein Motifs ', ' DNA Binding Domain ', ' Data ', ' Sum ', ' in vivo ', ' Collection ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' user-friendly ', ' loss of function ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' screening ', ' Geometry ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' predictive test ', ' predictive assay ', ' ']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,393339,NY-12
"Combining Systems Pharmacology Modeling With Machine Learning To Identify Sub-Populations At Risk Of Drug-Induced Torsades de Pointes Project Summary  Torsades de Pointes, a lethal ventricular arrhythmia, is a side effect of several commonly used antiarrhythmics, antibiotics, antipsychotics, antihistamines and other ‘non-cardiovascular’ therapies. Though this adverse event is rare, it can lead to ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death. The ignorance about the underlying differences between those at high risk versus low risk of forming this drug-induced arrhythmia halts any considerable progress in preventing it. Rather than simply removing these drugs from the market, a closer examination of the physiological and clinical traits of patients who benefited from the treatment and those who formed the arrhythmia needs to be performed. This highlights the idea of precision medicine and the importance of identifying relevant sub-groups of patients likely to benefit from a treatment versus those who are highly susceptible to a drug-induced adverse event. The current standards for predicting risk, a lengthened action potential (AP) duration of cells and a prolonged QT interval on an echocardiogram (ECG) have proven ineffective. Thus, there is a need to extract pertinent information from the cellular and tissue levels before administration of the therapeutic to detect patterns only apparent in the high-risk population. To analyze this concept, I plan to (1) explain at a mechanistic level the differences between the healthy and at-risk patients, (2) identify important AP and ECG signatures that can predict risk early on, and (3) connect the physiological and clinical findings to improve the profile and description of the high-risk population. I will combine two complementary computational techniques: (1) simulations with mechanistic quantitative systems pharmacology models of heart cells and tissues; and (2) advanced machine learning approaches that can identify hidden patterns. Thus, this project aims to develop an algorithm which will improve risk prediction and upgrade the current imperfect and unreliable standards for prescribing proarrhythmic therapies. Project Narrative Current standards for identifying patients at risk of forming the rare but lethal ventricular tachycardia, Drug- induced Torsades de Pointes include measuring the QT interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG). Although this decently predicts susceptibility, there remains a percentage of patients who still succumb to an arrhythmia with a normal QT. To improve patient risk stratification, this research project aims to develop an algorithm that can unmask subtle precursors at both the physiological and clinical levels, classify high risk patients, and upgrade the current imperfect standards for prescribing these therapies.",Combining Systems Pharmacology Modeling With Machine Learning To Identify Sub-Populations At Risk Of Drug-Induced Torsades de Pointes,10082298,F31HL149358,"['Action Potentials ', ' Algorithms ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antihistamines ', ' Arrhythmia ', ' Cardiac Arrhythmia ', ' Heart Arrhythmias ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Echocardiography ', ' Echocardiogram ', ' Transthoracic Echocardiography ', ' heart sonography ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' ECG ', ' EKG ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Incidence ', ' Ion Channel ', ' Ionic Channels ', ' Membrane Channels ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Physiology ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Torsades de Pointes ', ' Antipsychotic Agents ', ' Antipsychotic Drugs ', ' Antipsychotics ', ' Major Tranquilizers ', ' Major Tranquilizing Agents ', ' Neuroleptic Agents ', ' Neuroleptic Drugs ', ' Neuroleptics ', ' Translating ', ' Ventricular Fibrillation ', ' Ventricular Tachycardia ', ' Measures ', ' sudden cardiac death ', ' Ventricular Arrhythmia ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' delayed rectifier potassium channel ', ' delayed rectifying potassium channel ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Myocytes ', ' Muscle Cells ', ' trait ', ' simulation ', ' drug market ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' heart cell ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Ventricular ', ' Cardiac ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' high risk ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' Patient risk ', ' responders and non-responders ', ' responders from non-responders ', ' responders or non-responders ', ' responders versus non-responders ', ' responders vs non-responders ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' side effect ', ' complex data ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' efficacious treatment ', ' efficacious therapy ', ' ']",NHLBI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,F31,2021,44436,NY-13
"Using Genetic Diversity to Manage Neurological Disease Project Summary/Abstract Understanding and treating genome abnormalities that lead to rare genetic neurodegenerative diseases such as Niemann-Pick C1 globally managing cholesterol homeostasis, or APOE alleles impacting cholesterol homeostasis in the brain triggering late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD), present a major challenge from both basic science and clinical perspectives. We have developed a Gaussian process regression (GPR) based machine learning (ML) approach that captures for the first time genomic variation in the population to understand the spatial covariance (SCV) relationships contributing to sequence-to-function-to-structure relationships in the individual. Genetic disease is fundamentally a problem of understanding the impact of altered folding intermediates found in response to variation in the protein fold and how they are managed by proteostasis. Proteostasis encompasses a broad range of chaperone and degradative components that manage the synthesis, folding/stability and function of the protein fold in response to inherited and environmental stress and aging. The general premise of this proposal is to develop a deep genome-based understanding of proteostasis that will teach us how to manage genetic diseases triggered by folding stress. The rationale for this proposal is that sparse genetic diversity found in the population, when used as a collective through application of GRP-ML defined SCV relationships, can provide us on a residue-by-residue basis insight into the folding intermediates that contribute to disease for the entire polypeptide sequence. The objective of this proposal is to understand the role of proteostasis in managing this genetic diversity for the benefit of therapeutic intervention. We hypothesize that management of the polypeptide fold of disease-causing variant proteins found in the population by targeting the function of the multivalent Hsp40 and Hsp70 co-chaperone/chaperone branch (the Hsp70 axis) of the proteostasis network will enable precision correction of misfolding phenotypes found in neurodegenerative disease. Our approach will study the impact of variation in the Niemann Pick C1 (NPC1) gene. NPC1 is an inherited, autosomal recessive, disorder characterized by the abnormal accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and other lipids in late endosomal (LE) and lysosome (Ly) compartments of all cell types. The primary effect of NPC1 variation results in early onset neurodegenerative disease in response to loss of cholesterol homeostasis. In Aim 1 we will explore the ability of small molecules to allosterically regulate the activity of components of the Hsp70 axis to retune the synthesis, folding/stability, trafficking and/or function of NPC1 variants. In Aim 2 we will explore the molecular mechanism of action (MoA) of the Hsp70 axis components that are responsible for enabling NPC1 variant correction. Completion of both aims will generate a comprehensive assessment of the role of Hsp70 axis in NPC1 disease progression and will be used as a guide for advancement of a precision medicine approach to reduce or prevent the onset of neurodegenerative disease triggered by genomic variation in NPC1 population. Project Narrative Understanding the mechanism behind and treatment of genome abnormalities in the population that cause rare genetic disease in the individual represents a major challenge from both basic science and clinical perspectives. We will study the impact of genetic variation found in the Niemann Pick C1 (NPC1) gene, that, like APOE alleles driving late-onset Alzheimers disease (LOAD), is responsible for management of cholesterol homeostasis. We will use Gaussian process regression machine learning (GPR-ML) based spatial covariance (SCV) tools to define the mechanism of action of proteostasis components found in the Hsp70 axis to therapeutically manage the NPC1 fold leading to improved to cholesterol homeostasis in the individual to provide basic and clinical insight into disease management.",Using Genetic Diversity to Manage

"Application of advanced methodology to osteoarthritis phenotyping Osteoarthritis (OA) is highly prevalent, contributes to substantial morbidity in the population, and lacks effective interventions to prevent onset and progression. Importantly, and like many other chronic conditions, OA is not a single disease but rather a heterogeneous condition consisting of multiple subgroups, or phenotypes, with differing underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. It is becoming increasingly clear that consideration of specific OA phenotypes in clinical studies and trials is critically needed to move the field forward. The overall goal of this line of work is to identify and understand potential phenotypes of knee osteoarthritis (KOA) to better inform future research efforts and treatments; this exploratory R21 project using OA Initiative (OAI) data will investigate novel methodology to support phenotyping in KOA. Successful treatments for OA will need to be targeted to, and tested in, specifically chosen OA phenotypes. Our hypothesis is that an understanding of KOA phenotypes, a key step toward Precision Medicine in OA, will lead to more successful clinical studies in the long-term. To approach this important clinical problem, we propose a project in which we will apply innovative machine learning methods and validation strategies to data from the large, publicly available OAI cohort. We will leverage this large dataset, along with local expertise in statistics, biostatistics and machine learning methodology, to tackle the problem of phenotyping this heterogeneous disease. In Aim 1, we will utilize a data-driven, unsupervised learning approach, to cluster features that best define and discriminate among phenotypes of KOA in the OAI dataset, using biclustering and a novel significance test (SigClust) developed by co-I Marron. For Aim 2, we will test specific hypotheses of relevance to OA outcomes, such as differences between those with and without OA, or those who do or do not develop new or worsening disease, using another set of machine learning methods (Direction-projection-permutation [DiProPerm] hypothesis testing, and Distance-Weighted Discrimination [DWD]), also developed by co-I Marron, in the full cohort and in any identified clusters from Aim 1. In order to address these aims, this proposal involves interdisciplinary collaborations among experts in statistics, biostatistics, computer science, rheumatology, and epidemiology. This work will significantly impact the field by fulfilling a critical need to accurately define OA phenotypes, discover the key features associated with these phenotypes, link phenotype subgroups to underlying mechanisms and use this information to inform and focus future clinical studies. In the long term, we expect that this strategy will lead to more personalized and successful management of the millions of people affected by OA. Project narrative Osteoarthritis is an enormous and increasing public health problem, and like many other chronic conditions it is not a single disease but a heterogeneous condition consisting of multiple subgroups, or phenotypes, with differing underlying mechanisms. The lack of appreciation of this heterogeneity has contributed to the failure of all attempts to date to develop disease-modifying osteoarthritis drugs; future trials will need to target specific OA phenotypes.

"Building protein structure models for intermediate resolution cryo-electron microscopy maps Project Summary Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is an emerging technique in structural biology, which is capable of determining three-dimensional (3D) structures of biological macromolecules. Compared to conventional structural biology techniques, such as X-ray crystallography and NMR, a major advantage of cryo-EM is its ability to solve large macromolecular assemblies. Moreover, recent technical breakthroughs in cryo-EM have enabled determination of 3D structures at nearly atomic-level resolutions. Cryo-EM will undoubtedly become a method of central importance in structural biology in the next decade. With the rapid accumulation of cryo-EM structure data, it has become crucial to develop computational methods that can effectively build and extract 3D structures of biological macromolecules from EM maps. The goal of this project is to develop computational methods for modeling both global and local structures and for interpreting 3D structures embedded in EM maps of around 4 Å to medium-resolution. Recently, we have developed a new de novo protein structure modeling method, MAINMAST, which can model protein structures from an EM density map without using existing template or fragment structures on the map. Based on the successful development of MAINMAST, we further extend the capability of MAINMAST toward more accurate modeling and for multiple-chain modeling. In addition, we will also develop novel modeling methods for medium-resolution EM maps, which combine a coarse-grained protein structure modeling technique, methods in protein structure prediction, and a low- resolution image processing approach with deep learning, a state-of-the-art powerful machine learning method. The proposed project capitalizes on the tremendous efforts and progress made in structural determination with cryo-EM by developing computational tools that allow researchers to perform efficient and reliable structure analyses for 3D EM density maps. The project will greatly facilitate investigation into the molecular mechanisms of macromolecule function by providing an efficient means of 3D structure modeling.

"CRCNS: Multiple Time Scale Memory Consolidation in Neural Networks Detailed description of the proposed use of the animals, including species, strains, ages, sex, and number to be used; Dissociated, primary cultures will be prepared from the cortex of new born mice of either sex (mus musculus, Postnatal day 0-1). These experiments will be performed using pups obtained from Vglut1-IRES2-Cre strains mated with Floxopatch (Lou et al., 2016) strains so that pyramidal cells will express channel rhodopsin CheRiff and voltage indicator QuasR2. Up to 5 cultures can be grown, which can be used for 5 experiments. Justification for the use of animals, choice of species, and numbers to be used; Description of procedures for minimizing discomfort, distress, pain, and injury; and Method of euthanasia and the reasons for its selection. Transgenic mice (category C) will be used because the experiments rely on the expression of CheRiff and QuasR2 for optical stimulation/recording. There are no alternative species.  All experiments are terminal. Newborn mice will be cooled in ice prior to cervical dislocation and excision of the brain for culture preparation. All procedures are in accordance with guideleines of the NYU Animal Welfare Committee.  The estimated number of animals below ensure that we have a continuous supply of cultures to perform experiments on a daily basis. Based on our experience in the past 3 years, each postnatal day 0-1 (P0-P1) mouse will generate at least 5 culture preparations. A viable culture will have a have a high density of neurons that express the Floxopatch construct, which varies from mouse to mouse. Thus, if one culture is not viable, all cultures derived from that mouse are also unusable. The success rate is approximately 50%. Because cultures can be made only form P0-1 day old mice and because it is not possible to determine whether expression is sufficient until the day of the experiment 2-3 weeks later, we will need to make 2 sets of cultures per week. Thus, we will need to maintain 2 breeding pairs per week or 8 breeding pairs per month to have a continuous supply of cultures. The breeding pairs will either consist of wildtype mice (for viral injection) or Vglut1-IRES2-Cre - Gt(ROSA)26Sor (floxopatch) mice. Breeding pairs will be replaced every six months. Total animals for experiments: 32 mice/year (=16 mice (8 breeding pairs) x 2/year replacement of breeding pairs). To maintain the 3 lines, 2 males and 2 females each of Vglut1-IRES2-Cre, Gt(ROSA)26Sor, and wildtype mice will be kept in separate cages (4+4+4=12 mice total). Every 6 months (twice per year), the mice of each type will be bred. From their offsprings, 4 males and 4 females from each line will be weaned and kept in separated cages as above (4+ 4 + 4 = 12) and the 4 original breeding pairs (12 mice) euthanized. Overall, 24 mice/year will be used to maintain the lines. Total mice/year: 56 (=24 mice/year to maintain lines + 32 mice/year for experiment). Total mice over 3 years = 168 mice.

"Multiplexed imaging of viral protein processing and assembly in live cells Project Summary Imaging the full lifecycle of viral proteins in vivo is essential for understanding the molecular processes underlying viral infection. Live-cell imaging has long been performed using fluorescent protein fusion tags such as GFP. However, these tags can alter the size and function of targeted proteins. Furthermore, slow maturation, degradation, and photobleaching of tags results in the loss of signal, making it difficult to track the early life and ultimate fate of many proteins. Viral polyproteins, in particular, remain refractory to imaging in vivo due to their hypersensitivity to tags and the extensive processing and assembly they undergo during viral biogenesis. The use of linear epitope tags reversibly labeled by genetically encoded live-cell probes can solve many of these issues. Unfortunately, engineering functional probes for live-cell imaging of epitopes has been costly and time-consuming. In the proposed research, we combine expertise in protein engineering, single- molecule microscopy, and biochemistry to refine and accelerate the rational design of orthogonal epitope/probe pairs for highly multiplexed imaging of full viral protein lifecycles in living cells. We demonstrate the power of our strategy in our Preliminary Data by creating novel scFvs that bind the commonly used HA and Flag epitopes with high affinity in a variety of demanding live-cell imaging scenarios. In Aim 1, we will use our tested strategy to develop scFv against additional viral epitope tags and validate their utility in imaging experiments. To identify chimeric scFv that are both soluble and active within the cellular milieu, we will graft known epitope-specific CDR loops onto a unique panel of stable scFv scaffolds. In Aim 2, we will use state-of- the-art computational protein modeling and design to develop novel predictive binding models for scFv:viral- epitope complexes, establish and test protocols for de novo scFv design, engineer large scFv libraries encoding multiple new peptide-binding solutions, and screen using phage display. In Aim 3, we will demonstrate the utility of our newly developed scFv in live-cell imaging experiments by probing several critical aspects of viral biology. Specifically, we will use our engineered scFv to visualize and quantify the translation dynamics of flavivirus transmembrane polyproteins, and to monitor alphavirus particle assembly kinetics. Overall, this project will provide a powerful new pipeline for generating scFv proteins that can track viral proteins in living cells. The reagents we generate will provide the virus molecular biology community with new, versatile imaging tools to better illuminate many important biological processes. Project Narrative Conventional technology for intracellular imaging of viral proteins is limited in spatial and temporal resolution. This project will generate next-generation genetically encoded probe proteins that allow scientists to image when a given segment of a viral protein emerges from the ribosome, and observe when that segment moves or is buried during viral protein assembly. These tags will be used to image previously inaccessible processes, including viral polyprotein translation and homo-oligomerization of viral capsid proteins.",Multiplexed imaging of viral protein processing and assembly in live cells,10455219,R56AI155897,"['Alphavirus ', ' Alpha Virus ', ' Group A Arboviruses ', ' Antibodies ', ' Epitopes ', ' Antigenic Determinants ', ' Binding Determinants ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Biogenesis ', ' Origin of Life ', ' Biology ', ' Capsid ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chimera organism ', ' Chimera ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Crystallization ', ' Engineering ', ' Eukaryotic Cell ', ' Flavivirus ', ' Group B Arbovirus ', ' Genome ', ' Hand ', ' HIV-1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' HIV1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Allergy ', ' Immunoglobulin Fragments ', ' Antibody Fragments ', ' Infection ', ' Kinetics ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Libraries ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Microscopy ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Peptides ', ' Polyproteins ', ' Protein Engineering ', ' genetic protein engineering ', ' protein design ', ' Proteins ', ' Reagent ', ' Recombinant Proteins ', ' Genetic Recombination ', ' DNA Recombination ', ' Recombination ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Ribosomes ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Viral Proteins ', ' Viral Gene Products ', ' Viral Gene Proteins ', ' virus protein ', ' Viral Structural Proteins ', ' virology ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' viral infection ', ' virus infection ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' Virus Replication ', ' viral multiplication ', ' viral replication ', ' virus multiplication ', ' Virus ', ' Chimeric Proteins ', ' Chimera Protein ', ' Fusion Protein ', ' Label ', ' Refractory ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Ensure ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Directed Molecular Evolution ', ' directed evolution ', ' scaffolding ', ' scaffold ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Genetic Materials ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Viral ', ' Molecular Dynamics Simulation ', ' molecular dynamics ', ' particle ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' design and construct ', ' design and construction ', ' Modeling ', ' single molecule ', ' model design ', ' Coat Proteins ', ' Viral Coat Proteins ', ' Viral Outer Coat Protein ', ' Capsid Proteins ', ' Photobleaching ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Homo ', ' Address ', ' Affinity ', ' Data ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Device ', ' Molecular Virology ', ' Protein Dynamics ', ' Replication-Associated Process ', ' Replication Process ', ' in vivo ', ' Phage Display ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' molecular imaging ', ' molecule imaging ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' protein structure prediction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Consumption ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' in vivo imaging ', ' imaging in vivo ', ' non-invasive imaging ', ' noninvasive imaging ', ' temporal measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' live cell imaging ', ' live cell image ', ' live cellular image ', ' live cellular imaging ', ' live cell microscopy ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' multiplexed imaging ', ' real-time images ', ' realtime image ', ' ']",NIAID,COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY,R56,2021,517692,CO-04
"Advanced Training at the Interface of Engineering and Oral-Craniofacial Sciences Contact PD/PI: KOO, HYUN Oral diseases and disorders in the craniofacial complex disproportionally and devastatingly afflict susceptible populations, particularly impoverished families and medically or physically compromised persons. Novel engineering approaches, properly leveraged, can yield new paradigms to reveal disease mechanism, new strategies for disease mitigation, and new approaches for affordable/personalized therapies for dental caries, periodontal diseases, and oral cancer. To achieve this vision, academic research bound dentist-scientists must be adept in engineering concepts and engineers must be educated in oral and craniofacial sciences and needs; all must be aware of the complex clinical and regulatory landscapes. To address this urgent need, we propose a multidisciplinary training program in Penn’s School of Dental Medicine (PDM) and School of Engineering & Applied Sciences (SEAS) focused on training dentist-scientists and engineers for academic careers dedicated to research in precision oral health and healthcare innovation. Postdoctoral trainees will adopt cutting-edge approaches at the forefront of engineering and computational sciences to advance the fields of oral biofilm microbiome, host immunity and tissue regeneration, drawing on approaches including artificial intelligence, robotics, nanotechnology, and materials sciences, aware of developmental hurdles and requirements to safely bring new approaches to patients. Trainees will engage in interactive and tailored academic experiences with intensive mentored research via co-mentoring (one advisor from each school), and interaction with a career mentoring committee (CMC) that includes at least one dental clinician. Co-mentors and CMC members will be drawn from the Program Faculty of 26 faculty in PDM and SEAS with significant records of mentorship of multidisciplinary and translational research. Training will include: (1) engineering fundamentals for dental trainees and oral & craniofacial biology principles for engineering trainees, tailored to match their research project and academic needs, (2) clinical research and regulatory affairs, (3) principles of scientific rigor and reproducibility, (4) scientific writing and (5) workshops on professional and career development. Trainees will engage in academic and industry interactions, journal club, give symposia presentations, and participate in AADR/IADR activities. Training will culminate in F/K award applications focused on advancing oral health at the dental-engineering interface. The applicant pool at the University of Pennsylvania is exceptionally strong and diverse, and we anticipate being able to attract outstanding candidates. Furthermore, via partnerships with ADA, AADR/IADR and minority-serving dental schools, we will diversify our candidate pool. We plan to enroll 4 trainees per year. Importantly, this effort will be an element of a newly formed inter-school center between PDM and SEAS with shared funding. The proposed program, unique to Penn, leverages a superb research and training environment within a compact campus where resources for both schools are united through Penn’s new Center for Innovation and Precision Dentistry. Project Summary/Abstract Page 6 Contact PD/PI: KOO, HYUN Advances in engineering approaches offer previously unimagined opportunities to advance the NIDCR 2030 vision of precision oral health for all.

"Genome Informatics For Biobank-scale Data Genetic data of biobank scales offer a wealth of information that is not obvious in traditional smaller cohorts. We will develop and evaluate efficient and accurate algorithms and tools for the analysis of such data to reveal such information. In particular, we will develop methods for three main tasks: haplotype phasing refinement, genotype imputation, and relatedness inference. Although mature methods are available for these tasks in traditional smaller data sets, there is still a lack of scalable efficient and accurate methods and tools for handling genomic big data of that scale. Our main observation is that biobank-scale genetic data offer dense connections between individual data points. Unlike traditional methods based on the Li and Stephens hidden Markov models (HMMs), we models each individual using the individual-specific cohort, i.e., all the other individuals that are connected to the individual. We leverage the efficient positional Burrows-Wheeler transformation (PBWT), a foundational data structure for modeling haplotype matching. We were the first to develop a PBWT-based method for identifying IBD segments in biobank-scale cohorts, RaPID. We are also enriched the traditional PBWT data structure and algorithms to efficient haplotype search and allowing dynamic updates. In this application, we leverage our algorithm development expertise and develop an IBD-based algorithm for refining haplotype phasing of very large panels. We will also develop IBD-based algorithms for improving efficiency and cost-effectiveness of genotype imputation using a very large reference panel. In addition, we will develop RaPID-Affin algorithms for efficient and accurate inference of genetic relatedness. Finally, we will benchmark the methods and develop free software for the community. This project will empower modern genetic research by developing efficient informatics tools for very large genotyped cohorts. While large biobank-scale cohort offer new opportunities for genetics research, they also created daunting informatics challenges.

"Maximizing Online Obesity Treatment Response in the Primary Care Environment Using Clinical Decision Support PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT With the long-term career goal of becoming a leading independent researcher using technology-driven precision medicine approaches to improve obesity outcomes in primary care, the candidate, Dr. Hallie Espel- Huynh, PhD, proposes a mentored research project and career development plan that will prepare her to use advanced analytics to personalize routine clinical care for patients with obesity. Despite the promise of online interventions to maximize access to effective behavioral obesity treatments in primary care, many patients do not benefit due to nonresponse. Evidence-based rescue interventions (EBRI) can improve outcomes for these patients, however, primary care clinicians require guidance on when and how to intervene, and such a tool does not yet exist. Clinical decision support (CDS) has the potential to fill this gap by predicting risk for nonresponse, delivering alerts about this risk to clinicians, and enabling interventions to reverse it. The overall objective of this training application is to develop such a CDS for use in primary care and test its usability with primary care clinicians. The proposal aims to (1) use stakeholder input to align the content and format of the CDS with primary care providers’ needs, (2) build a machine learning model to predict early risk for online obesity treatment nonresponse for integration into the CDS, and (3) design the prototype CDS and test its usability with primary care clinicians, focusing on outcomes of feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness for the target primary care setting. This project is the first to combine precise nonresponse risk prediction with stakeholder-informed CDS to produce a tool that has the potential to maximize obesity treatment outcomes in primary care via delivery of CDS-facilitated, clinician-delivered rescue interventions. This research will result in a complete CDS tool that is ready for future clinical testing with patients in primary care, and which could greatly enhance the potential impact of online obesity treatment in this setting. The research plan is complemented by career development activities that include formal training in technology-assisted obesity and CVD management in primary care, stakeholder-centered CDS development, machine learning, and mixed methods for patient-oriented implementation research. Under the guidance of an experienced mentorship team, execution of the proposed research and training plan will lead Dr. Espel-Huynh to submission of a competitive R01 grant application to test CDS effectiveness in a pragmatic randomized clinical trial. PROJECT NARRATIVE Behavioral treatment for obesity is being disseminated online to at-risk patients in primary care, yet high levels of nonresponse limit its potential public health impact. The proposed research aims to use stakeholder input to develop a clinical decision support tool that guides clinicians to efficiently and effectively intervene on obesity treatment nonresponse, which will ultimately improve obesity treatment outcomes and reduce weight-related cardiovascular disease risk.",Maximizing Online Obesity Treatment Response in the Primary Care Environment Using Clinical Decision Support,10301403,K23HL155733,"['Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Body Weight ', ' Body Weight Changes ', ' Weight Change ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Eating Disorders ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Heart ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Sleep ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' body weight loss ', ' wt-loss ', ' Weight ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Development Plans ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' Scientist ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Research Training ', ' i(19) ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Monitor ', ' Preparation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' obesity treatment ', ' obesity intervention ', ' obesity therapy ', ' cost ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' implementation research ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Non obese ', ' Nonobese ', ' Population ', ' frontier ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinical effect ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' primary care setting ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' routine care ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' pragmatic effectiveness trial ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' personalized care ', ' Precision care ', ' individualized care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' support tools ', ' Data Science ', ' improved outcome ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' clinical decision support ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' treatment risk ', ' advanced analytics ', ' clinical center ', ' online intervention ', ' obese patients ', ' patients with obesity ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NHLBI,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,K23,2021,187418,RI-01
"Muscle Control Mechanism of Voice Production in Vocal Fold Paralysis Project Summary After nearly five decades of human voice research, much remains unknown regarding muscle control mechanism of voice production. Studies confirmed that vocal fold pre-phonatory posture (geometry, position, tension and stiffness) is among the primary factors controlling vocal fold vibratory dynamics and voice type. However, very limited data is available on muscle control of these properties, primarily due to experimental difficulties. Muscle control of glottic geometry and dynamics has been studied in in vivo human and animal models, but these studies were limited to an endoscopic superior view, thus cannot to provide 3D deformation/movement of the vocal folds. Moreover, tension and stiffness of the vocal fold tissues are very difficult to obtain in vivo due to a lack of reliable techniques. A significant knowledge gap remains regarding how intrinsic laryngeal muscles (ILMs) control voice production through vocal fold posturing as well as how ILM dysfunctions, such as vocal fold paralysis/paresis (VFP), affect voice production by altering vocal fold posturing. In this project, we propose to use an innovative approach that integrates experimental data and state-of-the-art computer modeling techniques to produce a complete dataset of 3D vocal fold postures (geometry, position, tension, stiffness), 3D vocal fold vibratory dynamics, and voice outcomes in the full muscle control space including symmetric, asymmetric and compensative muscle activations. The PI’s group recently developed a state-of-the-art, physics based, 3D computer model that integrates realistic laryngeal anatomy, physiologically quantifiable inputs, inverse material parameterization and machine learning for simulating vocal fold posturing and flow-structure-acoustics interaction (FSAI) during voice production. For this project, we propose to combine this embodied model with experimental data to generate a holistic view of vocal fold posturing and FSAI with great temporal and spatial details in the full muscle control space. In particular, the model will reveal the 3D complexity of vocal fold postures and vibrations and provide measures of tension and stiffness with muscle activations, which have not been available. We propose to use the dataset to elucidate causal links among muscle activity, vocal fold posturing, vocal fold vibration and voice outcome. Muscle combinations with distinct posturing, vibration and acoustic patterns will be identified. The new knowledge is expected to elucidate the muscle control mechanism of voice production through vocal fold posturing. The proposed work has the potential to improve insight into the function and dysfunction of the ILMs and to serve as a foundation for novel, targeted therapeutic approaches. We hope to develop possible biomechanical metrics for the diagnosis and optimal methodology for treatment of VFP. Project Narrative Vocal fold paralysis/paresis (VFP) is the most common etiology of voice disorders which affects 9% of the U.S. population. Diagnosis and optimal treatment of VFP remain challenging because of incomplete understanding of muscle control mechanism of vocal fold posturing and vibration. This project will build causal links among muscle activation, vocal fold posturing, vocal fold vibration and voice acoustics, allowing for the development of possible biomechanical metrics for diagnosis and optimal treatment of VFP.",Muscle Control Mechanism of Voice Production in Vocal Fold Paralysis,10299679,R15DC019229,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Affect ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Consultations ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Canis familiaris ', ' Canine Species ', ' Dogs ', ' Dogs Mammals ', ' canine ', ' domestic dog ', ' Foundations ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laryngeal muscle structure ', ' Laryngeal Muscles ', ' larynx muscle ', ' Larynx ', ' Laryngeal ', ' Larynx Head and Neck ', ' voice box ', ' Methodology ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Otolaryngology ', ' otorhinolaryngology ', ' Paresis ', ' Muscle Paresis ', ' Muscular Paresis ', ' paretic ', ' paretic muscle ', ' Physics ', ' Posture ', ' Production ', ' Research ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Universities ', ' vocal cord ', ' Vocal Fold ', ' Voice ', ' Voice Disorders ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Link ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Compensation ', ' insight ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' vibration ', ' Palsy ', ' Plegia ', ' paralysis ', ' paralytic ', ' Paralysed ', ' professor ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI Scans ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Data ', ' M.D. ', ' Doctor of Medicine ', ' in vivo ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' Geometry ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' human model ', ' model of human ', ' optimal treatments ', ' optimal therapies ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF MAINE ORONO,R15,2021,431951,ME-02
"Fibroblast Heterogeneity in Pancreatic Cancer ABSTRACT Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is characterized by an extensive desmoplastic stroma that represents a major challenge for its effective treatment and improved survival of patients. We seek to define the composition and roles of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the most abundant cell population in the PDA stroma, as a potential avenue for the development of new therapeutic strategies. Although CAFs have been historically considered tumor-promoting components, their ablation in pre-clinical and clinical studies have led to mixed outcomes, indicating the poorly understood complexity of CAFs. To investigate CAF biology, we previously established a pancreatic tumor organoid/fibroblast co-culture model. In addition, we performed single cell RNA- sequencing (scRNA-seq) of murine and human PDA specimens to characterize CAF composition at single-cell resolution. These analyses have revealed that fibroblasts are heterogeneous and comprised of at least three distinct subtypes with unique transcriptional and functional features. More so, this heterogeneity emphasizes the need to design therapies that selectively target the tumor-promoting CAF populations. Although our work has started to reveal the complex heterogeneity of fibroblasts in primary or metastatic PDA tissues, iterative developments in scRNA-seq and analysis methods have revealed four additional CAF subtypes in primary and metastatic PDA. To comprehensively define the CAF repertoire in primary and metastatic PDA, we will systematically differentiate CAF subtypes and their regulatory elements using scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, machine-learning computational methods, and in situ tissue analytic methods that detect RNA and protein species, such as imaging mass cytometry (Aim 1). We hypothesize that a deeper understanding of the dynamic CAF states that occurs in primary and metastatic PDA will guide the selection of specific therapeutic regimens. To complement this analysis, we will identify new CAF subtypes and study their dynamics in a novel murine model with a reversible mutant Kras allele (Aim 2). Furthermore, we will study CAF-activating pathways by investigating several genes implicated in stromal activation that were revealed using our recently developed intraductal transplantation model of PDA (Aim 2). These new mediators appear to have roles in PDA progression, immunosuppression, and stromal activation, and may represent new PDA therapeutic targets. Finally, we have demonstrated different immunomodulatory functions of distinct CAF subtypes. We will test combinatorial strategies to target distinct CAF subtypes in the PDA microenvironment, and study the effect of these strategies on tumor progression in a murine PDA model (Aim 3). In addition, we will assess the role of macrophage-CAF crosstalk in promoting and maintaining CAF identify. Overall, this project will clarify the diversity of PDA CAFs and the role of cancer cells in regulating CAF subtypes. Our results will provide new avenues for CAF-targeting that we intend to translate towards improved therapies for patients afflicted by this lethal disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Pancreatic cancer is a deadly disease, in part, because the cancer cells are able to recruit non-cancerous cells called “fibroblasts” that in turn can help the cancer cells grow and evade therapies. The purpose of this study is to better understand how these non-cancerous fibroblast cells change during the development of pancreatic cancer, how different types of noncancerous cells contribute to tumor growth, and how we can develop new drugs to prevent these cells from aiding the cancer cells. This work will identify new ways to block the cancer- promoting, fibroblast cells, which could lead to new treatments for patients affected by pancreatic cancer.",Fibroblast Heterogeneity in

"A Data and Administrative Coordinating Center for the Impact of Genomic Variation on Function Consortium Project Summary/Abstract The goals of the IGVF Data Administrative and Coordinating Center (DACC) are to support the IGVF Consortium by defining and establishing a strategy that connects all participants to the project’s science. By creating avenues of access that distribute these data to the greater biological research community, the DACC provides a critical connection between scientific producers and consumers. The IGVF Consortium brings together laboratories that generate complex data types via novel experimental assays, often focusing at the single-cell level of gene expression. This work is extended and regularized by laboratories that integrate these unique data using computational analyses to discover the associations and networks between human variation, chromosomal elements and molecular phenotypes for the purpose of elucidating their complex relationship in human cells and tissues. The DACC’s participation enhances the data created by the consortium through the creation of structured procedures for the verification and validation of all submitted data and providing processes for the documentation of metadata that describe each biological sample and assay method. To facilitate access to all the data created, the DACC will construct a state of the art data warehouse, design and develop robust software to enable data submission, and harden unified data processing pipelines. All experimental and computational results will be made available via the IGVF Portal, developed by the DACC. The Portal will integrate these data resources and provide enhanced search and browsing capabilities, along with powerful web services. The DACC will develop tools for semantically-enhanced graph-based searches of experiment metadata, individual genomic elements, variation and phenotype, and will implement methods to distribute these results in matrices suitable for machine learning. Beyond computational infrastructure to house and distribute consortium data, the DACC will also function as the administrative hub of the IGVF. Consortium science thrives on clear and forthright communication between its component parts, and it is the DACC’s responsibility to manage this relationship. This effort will be facilitated by management of consortium working groups, organization of scientific results and publications, and providing regular reporting and feedback to the Steering committee. To fully support the community, the DACC will act as a service organization, allowing biomedical research to take full advantage of the results from the IGVF. To this end, the DACC will organize and host consortium- focused and user-focused meetings, and will provide documentation via many media including written documentation, video tutorials, webinars, and meeting presentations. The various component projects of the IGVF (DACC, mapping, systematic characterization, genetic network regulation, modeling of genomic variation centers and groups) will be tightly woven together to create the IGVF Consortium. Relevance to Public Health, Project Narrative Through this project we will create a Data Administration and Coordinating Center (DACC) for the NHGRI Impact of Genomic Variation and Function (IGVF), which promises to transform our understanding of the associations between genetic variation and phenotype. Our proposed DACC will serve as the primary administration, communication, outreach and data center for IGVF awardees and provide leadership for standards and processing pipeline implementation, and facilitate FAIR databases and software. Due to our cross-cutting and unparalleled technical expertise in data management, genomics, informatics, network analysis, and privacy-preserving application as well as our role leading a large data coordination center, managing, coordinating data and metadata, as well as creating gold standard knowledgebases, Stanford is in a strong position to serve as the IGVF DACC.",A Data and Administrative Coordinating Center for the Impact of Genomic Variation on Function Consortium,10296944,U24HG012012,"['Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Sources ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' E-Mail ', ' Email ', ' electronic communication ', ' Elements ', ' Feedback ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leadership ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Semantics ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Standardization ', ' Students ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' Technical Expertise ', ' technical skills ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Policies ', ' Selection Criteria ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' catalog ', ' Catalogs ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' data management ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Informatics ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Graph ', ' outreach ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Regulation ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' functional genomics ', ' Genomics ', ' Documentation ', ' scientific organization ', ' Data ', ' Retrieval ', ' Cellular Assay ', ' cell assay ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Ontology ', ' Update ', ' To specify ', ' Process ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' web services ', ' web-based service ', ' working group ', ' work group ', ' National Human Genome Research Institute ', ' NHGRI ', ' National Center for Human Genome Research ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' distributed data ', ' Data Coordinating Center ', ' Data Coordination Center ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' biological research ', ' molecular phenotype ', ' computer infrastructure ', ' computational infrastructure ', ' verification and validation ', ' genomic variation ', ' social media ', ' webinar ', ' online resource ', ' internet resource ', ' on-line compendium ', ' on-line resource ', ' online compendium ', ' web resource ', ' web-based resource ', ' cloud storage ', ' cloud-based storage ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' FAIR principles ', ' FAIR data ', ' FAIR guiding principles ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable ', ' data resource ', ' service organization ', ' data warehouse ', ' data submission ', ' data deposition ', ' analysis pipeline ', ' data centers ', ' data analysis pipeline ', ' data processing pipeline ', ' complex data ', ' privacy preservation ', ' data harmonization ', ' harmonized data ', ' implementation facilitation ', ' ']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U24,2021,2739389,CA-18
"Efficient nonparametric estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects in causal inference PROJECT SUMMARY In nearly all studies of comparative effectiveness, the investigators seek to estimate how an in- tervention changes outcomes on average. That is, are outcomes for treated subjects better on average than for untreated subjects? While the average treatment effect (ATE) is a useful sum- mary of the treatment effect, the treatment effect may vary from patient to patient. The ATE is a low-dimensional summary of a treatment effect, since it summarizes the overall effect of the treatment using a single quantitative measure and ignores possible effect heterogeneity. Many in- vestigators seek to go beyond low-dimensional summaries by estimating heterogenous treatment effects (HTEs). The most common approach to the estimation of HTEs relies on simple statistical methods. Specifically, regression models are widely used but may be biased due to the linear functional form especially where HTEs that are nonlinear or based on complex combinations of patient subgroups. Currently, there is considerable interest in developing more flexible methods for the estimation of the HTEs. In this project, we will use the the doubly robust machine learning (DRML) framework to develop improved methods for a variety of HTEs. The DRML framework is a combination of semiparametric theory, machine learning (ML) methods, and doubly robust estimators. The key advantage of the DRML framework is that it allows one to reduce bias using ML estimation methods, while retaining the efficiency of parametric models. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our project will develop methods for the nonparametric estimation of heterogenous treatment effects (HTEs). We will (1) develop methods for HTEs that vary with baseline variables, (2) develop HTE methods for IV designs, and for time-varying effects, and (3) we will apply the methods to three original applications.",Efficient nonparametric estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects in causal inference,10297407,R01LM013361,"['Abdomen ', ' Abdominal ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Confidence Intervals ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Masks ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Ensure ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Sample Size ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' non-compliant ', ' noncompliance ', ' noncompliant ', ' non-compliance ', ' Endometrial Cancer ', ' Endometrium Cancer ', ' Endometrium Carcinoma ', ' Endometrial Carcinoma ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Hospital Nursing ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' treatment effect ', ' patient population ', ' treatment strategy ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' individualized medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapeutic strategy ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' study population ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' semiparametric ', ' high dimensionality ', ' care outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' Comparative Effectiveness Research ', ' comparative effectiveness study ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,364126,PA-03
"The unleashed microbiome of cancer patients as a discovery platform for rational microbiome engineering Project Summary The human gut microbiome is associated with a range of diseases, and may positively or negatively affect the success of therapies. However, the causal directions between the human gut microbiome and host health are seldomly clear due to a lack of feasible controlled experiments in humans. High resolution, high frequency temporal data of paired microbiome and physiological measurement, and rich metadata of potential confounders, allow the application of causal inference frameworks. Such data can be mined for potential microbiome drivers of host health, especially if both the microbiome and host physiology are perturbed during the time courses. We have recently published a vast longitudinal microbiome set from cancer patients undergoing severe perturbation of their immune system. Concurrently, these patients experience dramatic shifts in their gut ecosystem. We here propose to unlock this data and build a discovery platform for microbiome causality, towards rational microbiome engineering. We will develop a new machine-learning technique that enables rapid exploration of our data through effective visualization and a web-based interface. We will develop a new method to identify gut microbial competitor species of common pathogens, which are systematically missed by existing approaches but are representing the most promising targets for microbiome engineering. Finally, we will elucidate the bidirectional interplay between human- targeted medications and the gut microbiome. For this, we will leverage our large data set of paired microbiome and host immune cell trajectories. This will validate recent in vitro results indicating that human-targeted medications may influence gut ecology using in situ data, and it will identify potential gut microbiome modulation of pharmacokinetics. Project Narrative This project seeks to provide a platform for the discovery of causal health effects of the human gut microbiome. For this, it provides exploration tools and inference techniques that unlock the potential of a recently acquired, vast data set comprising >10,000 stool samples, >1.5 million medical records, and >400,000 blood measurements from cancer patients. This enables discovery of candidate microbes that affect pharmacokinetics of human-targeted drugs, and reveals natural competitor species to common pathogens, thus revealing targets for rational microbiome engineering, towards turning the human gut microbiome into a therapeutic target of the future.",The unleashed microbiome of cancer patients as a discovery platform for rational microbiome

"Continuous Probing of Nanoconstruct-Cell Interactions at Biologically Relevant Time Scales PROJECT SUMMARY  This proposal aims to develop live-cell, multi-channel imaging tools that can visualize—continuously, and in real time—nanoparticle interactions with cellular components. We will focus on several different time windows, where early time periods will monitor nanoparticle-cell membrane binding and uptake and later times will track endosomal accumulation and escape. The ability to resolve temporally and spatially how particle size/shape and ligand density affects interactions in 3D is critical for determining structure-activity-relationships and mechanism of action in live cells. To characterize interactions of functional nanoparticles with different cellular structures at physiologically relevant times, we propose to design a multi-channel optical microscope integrated with an opto- splitter and custom live-cell imaging chamber. Simultaneous images can be acquired in different channels of the fluorescence of dye-labeled organelles and dye-labeled ligands on the particles as well as differential interference contrast (DIC) signals of whole cells, cellular components, and nanoparticle cores. Correlation of structural and functional images provides a powerful window into how local nanoconstruct interactions can mediate a biological response. For model systems, we will compare gold nanoconstructs with oligonucleotide ligand shells of both targeting (DNA aptamers) or non-targeting (siRNA) properties. Nanoparticle shape enables a unique handle to probe rotation and orientation of intracellular particle interactions. This work can bridge a gap in understanding the behavior of nanoconstructs intracellularly and how the integrity and presentation of oligonucleotides in ligand shells affects targeting and other processes such as endosomal escape, which is critical to assess therapeutic efficacy. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH  This proposal aims to design tools that can visualize nanoparticle interactions with cells at distinct time points with biological relevance. Our ultimate goal is to evaluate how nanoconstructs interact with cellular membranes and sub-cellular components.

"Enhancing open data sharing for functional genomics experiments: Measures to quantify genomic information leakage and file formats for privacy preservation Project Summary/Abstract: With the surge of large genomics data, there is an immense increase in the breadth and depth of different omics datasets and an increasing importance in the topic of privacy of individuals in genomic data science. Detailed genetic and environmental characterization of diseases and conditions relies on the large-scale mining of functional genomics data; hence, there is great desire to share data as broadly as possible. However, there is a scarcity of privacy studies focused on such data. A key first step in reducing private information leakage is to measure the amount of information leakage in functional genomics data, particularly in different data file types. To this end, we propose to to derive information-theoretic measures for private information leakage in different data types from functional genomics data. We will also develop various file formats to reduce this leakage during sharing. We will approach the privacy analysis under three aims. First, we will develop statistical metrics that can be used to quantify the sensitive information leakage from raw reads. We will systematically analyze how linking attacks can be instantiated using various genotyping methods such as single nucleotide variant and structural variant calling from raw reads, signal profiles, Hi-C interaction matrices, and gene expression matrices. Second, we will study different algorithms to implement privacy-preserving transformations to the functional genomics data in various forms. Particularly, we will create privacy-preserving file formats for raw sequence alignment maps, signal track files, three-dimensional interaction matrices, and gene expression quantification matrices that contain information from multiple individuals. This will allow us to study the sources of sensitive information leakages other than raw reads, for example signal profiles, splicing and isoform transcription, and abnormal three-dimensional genomic interactions. Third, we will investigate the reads that can be mapped to the microbiome in the raw human functional genomics datasets. We will use inferred microbial information to characterize private information about individuals, and then combine the microbial information with the information from human mapped reads to increase the re-identification accuracy in the linking attacks described in the second aim. We will use the tools to quantify the sensitive information and privacy-preserving file formats in the available datasets from large sequencing projects, such as the ENCODE, The Cancer Genome Atlas, 1,000 Genomes, gEUVADIS, and Genotype-Tissue Expression projects. Project Narrative: Sharing large-scale functional genomics data is critical for scientific discovery, but comes with important privacy concerns related to the possible misuse of such data. This proposal will quantify and manage the rieslkasted to releasing functional genomics datasets, based on integrating inferred genotypes from the raw sequence files, signal tracks, and microbiome mapped sequences. Finally, we will develop file formats, statistical methodologies, and related software for anonymization of functional genomics data that enable open sharing.",Enhancing open data sharing for functional genomics experiments: Measures to quantify genomic information leakage and file formats for privacy preservation,10251876,R01HG010749,"['Algorithms ', ' Biology ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Extravasation ', ' Leakage ', ' Spillage ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutes ', ' Laws ', ' Learning ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mining ', ' Motivation ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Privatization ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Splicing ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Measures ', ' Medical Research ', ' Privacy ', ' Sequence Alignment ', ' sequencing alignment ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Glean ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Pythons ', ' Link ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Individual ', ' Data Files ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Letters ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Smoker ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' human tissue ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' interest ', ' Isoforms ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' QTL ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' microbial ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' single nucleotide variant ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Sampling ', ' functional genomics ', ' Genomics ', ' Provider ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Address ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' microbiome ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' file format ', ' data sharing ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' TCGA ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Data Science ', ' open data ', ' open science ', ' open-source data ', ' Genotype-Tissue Expression Project ', ' GTEx ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' DNA sequencing ', ' DNA seq ', ' DNAseq ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' privacy preservation ', ' Hi-C ', ' ']",NHGRI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,526482,CT-03
"Multi-Scale 3-D Image Analytics for High Dimensional Spatial Mapping of Normal Tissues PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall goal of the proposed project is to develop open-source software and algorithms for 3-D reconstruc- tion and multi-scale mapping of normal tissues. Another significant goal is to evaluate effects of aging and envi- ronmental factors on molecular and structural architecture of skin. We will leverage our mature (TRL8) technol- ogy for multiplexed 2-D imaging (Cell DIVE™), and our vast experience in 2-D image analytics and machine learning. We have selected normal skin as the organ to develop these tools for several reasons, a) clinical sam- ples from different age groups are more readily available, b) it is a good model to independently capture changes in extracellular matrix (ECM) due to age and normal exposure to environmental factors as well as a variety of pathogenic insults. While the ECM, cellular and intracellular molecular composition varies considerably among various organs, we believe many of the tools developed under this program will be applicable to reconstruct and map other organ models at high (cellular/subcellular) resolution. This proposal will focus on developing algo- rithms and a framework for multi-scale mapping of 3-D tissue images, which will address HuBMAP priorities around quantitative 3-D image analysis/mapping, including automated 3-D image segmentation, feature ex- traction, and image annotation. High-resolution (subcellular) mapping of biomolecules will be implemented us- ing 2-D multiplexed images that are used to reconstruct the 3-D tissue and linked to a lower resolution 3-D opti- cal coherence tomography (OCT) image of the normal tissue. Other cell-level omic data (e.g., RNA FISH) will be mapped in the same way. The low-resolution image is mapped back to a higher-level landmark (e.g., organ) as defined by the HuBMAP common coordinate framework (CCF). As outlined, our proposed technologies will in- clude several key features that are significant and complimentary to existing HuBMAP consortium projects and will advance the state of the art in 3-D tissue analysis. The proposed algorithms will have several key innova- tions that will advance the state of the art in 3-D multiplexed tissue image analysis. First, given the large vol- umes to be analyzed, high throughput will be a key requirement of each image analysis algorithm. This will be supported by our extensive experience in parallelizing single cell analysis pipelines. Second, the proposed algo- rithms will segment the images at multiple scales. The third area of innovation will focus on efficient multi- channel analysis. The proposed project will include creation of an easy-to-use software tool for assembling and visualizing multiscale tissue data called Tissue Atlas Navigation Graphical Overview (TANGO).

"Multiplex gene sequencing and metabolomics analysis from newborn dried blood spots to improve screening and diagnosis of metabolic disorders. Abstract: Newborn screening (NBS) using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) has transformed our ability to identify and provide early, lifesaving treatment to infants with inborn errors of metabolism. While MS/MS screening identifies most affected babies, it is accompanied by frequent false-positive results that require collecting blood and urine samples for additional confirmatory testing. While DNA sequencing has become an important part of confirmatory testing, newborn dried blood spots (DBS) yield only small and highly variable DNA amounts. There is an urgent need for a more efficient second-tier NBS approach for confirming all screen-positive cases directly from the DBS cards collected at birth. This is especially critical for infants at risk for metabolic disease in their first weeks of life. The overall objective of this proposal is to combine novel DNA sequencing and mass spectrometry technology to diagnose inborn metabolic disorders from DBS, and to demonstrate the clinical feasibility of this approach for second-tier screening. To achieve this objective, the following specific aims will be pursued: (1) Develop multiplex gene sequencing (RUSPseq) and 10X linked-read sequencing for rapid genetic diagnosis without the need for additional parental testing; (2) Develop mass spectrometry (Q-TOF/LC-MS) and Random Forest (RF) machine learning to identify novel metabolic markers, which will be integrated in a novel second-tier screening panel to separate true and false-positive cases; and (3) Demonstrate clinical and translational feasibility of this approach to more rapidly identify both true and false-positive cases. We will work with the public NBS program and NBSTRN’s Pilot Research and Implementation workgroup to translate this combined approach into second-tier NBS. These outcomes will have significant impact by reducing diagnostic delays and uncertainties, and by reducing iterative testing rounds and the cost associated with them, thereby reducing the burden on the healthcare system as well as patients and their families. Project Narrative: We will establish novel genetic and metabolomic technology for newborn screening (NBS) from dried blood spots, and apply machine learning to reduce false-positive screens and delayed diagnosis of true-positive cases. Early detection and confirmation of inborn errors of metabolism that can present in the first weeks of life is critical, specifically when screening in diverse multiethnic populations where we have less understanding of the biochemical genetic and clinical phenotypes. We will work with local hospitals and the NBS program to establish clinical and translational validity to this new project, which will contribute to maintaining parental trust in public NBS.",Multiplex gene sequencing and metabolomics analysis from newborn dried blood spots to improve screening and diagnosis of metabolic disorders.,10251254,R01HD102537,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Differentiation Antigens ', ' Differentation Markers ', ' Differentiation Markers ', ' Marker Antigens ', ' Archives ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Volume ', ' California ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Family ', ' Genes ', ' Biochemical Genetics ', ' Goals ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Hospitals ', ' Infant ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Newborns ', ' newborn child ', ' newborn children ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Inborn Errors of Metabolism ', ' Hereditary Metabolic Disorder ', ' inborn metabolism disorder ', ' Methods ', ' Neonatal Screening ', ' Newborn Infant Screening ', ' newborn screening ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Savings ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Compound Q ', ' Trichosanthin ', ' alpha-Trichosanthin ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Work ', ' Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator ', ' CFTR ', ' CFTR Protein ', ' cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biochemical ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Trust ', ' Measurement ', ' Letters ', ' Metabolic ', ' Spottings ', ' Genetic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' genetic diagnosis ', ' genetic disorder diagnosis ', ' tandem mass spectrometry ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' case control ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Metabolic Marker ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' cost ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' novel marker ', ' new marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' NGS Method ', ' NGS system ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' screening ', ' carrier status ', ' genetic approach ', ' genetic strategy ', ' web-based tool ', ' DNA sequencing ', ' DNA seq ', ' DNAseq ', ' screening panel ', ' screening program ', ' random forest ', ' multi-ethnic ', ' multiethnic ', ' ']",NICHD,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,505339,CT-03
"Machine Learning for Integrative Modeling of the Immune System in Clinical Settings Machine Learning for Integrative Modeling of the Immune System in Clinical Settings In response to an immunological challenge, immune cells act in concert forming complex and dense networks. A deep understanding of these immune responses is often the first step in developing immune therapies and diagnostic tests. Multivariate modeling algorithms can simultaneously consider all measured aspects of the immune system but requires prohibitively larger cohort sizes as technological advancements increase the number of measurements (a.k.a., “Curse of Dimensionality”). To address this, we propose a series of studies to develop machine learning algorithms for comprehensive profiling of the immune system in clinical settings. Particularly, for analysis of the immune system at a single-cell-level, we will leverage the stochastic nature of clustering algorithms to produce a robust pipeline for prediction of clinical outcomes. Next, we introduce the immunological Elastic-Net (iEN) algorithm, which addresses both the curse of dimensionality and reproducibility by integrating prior immunological knowledge into the models.  The cellular systems that govern immunity act through symbiotic interactions with multiple interconnected biological systems. The simultaneous interrogation of these systems with suitable technologies can reveal otherwise unrecognized crosstalk. In collaboration with several leading laboratories, we have produced multiomics datasets (including analysis the genome, proteome, microbiome, and metabolome) in synchronized groups of patients. Using these coordinated datasets, we will evaluate several algorithms for combining multiple biological modalities while accounting for the intrinsic characteristics of each assay, to reveal biological cross- talk across various systems and increase combined predictive power. Importantly, numerous population- level factors (including medical history, environmental, and socioeconomic factors) significantly impact the immune system and studies focused on homogenous patient populations often lack generalizability to other populations. To address this, we will develop machine learning strategies to integrate population-level factors directly into our immunological data. These models will objectively define subpopulations of patients and enable flexibility in the coefficients of the models (and hence, the importance of the various biological measurements) in each group.  This research program will be executed using data from several biorepositories focused on various diseases. This approach will ensure generalizability of our work to previously unseen datasets and increase the long-term impact of our findings. Throughout the proposal, a major area of focus is the development of visualization and model-reduction strategies that lay the foundation for interpretation of complex models. The machine learning algorithms developed will be readily applicable to a broad range of multiomics and multicohort studies and will be available as open-source software. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent technological advances have enabled the production of large immune monitoring datasets, providing an opportunity for systems-level efforts to harness the power of the immune system in developing immune therapies and diagnostic tests. In this project, we will develop machine learning algorithms for analysis of the immune system at a single-cell level, in a multiomics setting integrated with various other biological measurements, and subject to adjustments based on population-level factors. This work will provide a strong quantitative bridge between large-scale epidemiologic trends and deep biological profiling to investigate the complex mechanisms that govern the immune system in clinical settings.",Machine Learning for Integrative Modeling of the Immune System in Clinical Settings,10251069,R35GM138353,"['Accounting ', ' Algorithms ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Foundations ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Immunity ', ' Immunotherapy ', ' Immune mediated therapy ', ' Immunologically Directed Therapy ', ' immune therapeutic approach ', ' immune therapeutic interventions ', ' immune therapeutic regimens ', ' immune therapeutic strategy ', ' immune therapy ', ' immune-based therapies ', ' immune-based treatments ', ' immuno therapy ', ' Laboratories ', ' Immunologic Monitoring ', ' Immune Monitoring ', ' Immunological Monitoring ', ' Immunomonitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Production ', ' Research ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' socio-economic factors ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Measurement ', ' Immunological Models ', ' Immunologic Model ', ' Medical History ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' cohort ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Modality ', ' Proteome ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Immunologics ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologically ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' microbiome ', ' Population ', ' open source ', ' patient population ', ' biological systems ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' genome analysis ', ' Algorithmic Analysis ', ' Algorithmic Analyses ', ' Analyses of Algorithms ', ' Analysis of Algorithms ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' metabolome ', ' metabonome ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' Epidemiological trend ', ' Epidemiologic trend ', ' Epidemiology trend ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' Visualization ', ' Immunodiagnostics ', ' immunological diagnostics ', ' ']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,394250,CA-18
"Bayesian Machine Learning Tools for Analyzing Microbiome Dynamics The human microbiota plays an important role in health and disease, and its therapeutic manipulation is being actively investigated for a wide range of diseases that span every NIH institute. Our microbiota are inherently dynamic, and analyzing these time-dependent properties is key to robustly linking the microbiota to disease, and predicting the effects of therapies targeting the microbiota; indeed, longitudinal microbiome data is being acquired with increasing frequency, and is a major component of many NIH-funded projects. However, there is currently a dearth of computational tools for analyzing microbiome time-series data, which presents several special challenges including high measurement noise, irregular and sparse temporal sampling, and complex dependencies between variables. The objective of this proposal is to introduce new capabilities, improve on, and provide state-of-the-art implementations of tools for analyzing dynamics, or patterns of change in microbiome time-series data. The tools we develop will use Bayesian machine learning methods, which are well-recognized for their strong conceptual and practical advantages, particularly in biomedical domains. Tools will be rigorously tested and validated on synthetic and real human microbiome data, including publicly available datasets and those from collaborators providing 16S rRNA sequencing, metagenomic, and metabolomics data. We propose three specific aims. For Aim 1, we will develop integrated Bayesian machine learning tools for predicting population dynamics of the microbiome and its responses to perturbations. These tools will include a new model that simultaneously learns groups of microbes with similar interaction structure and predicts their behavior over time, and that incorporates prior phylogenetic information. The model will be further improved by incorporating stochastic microbial dynamics and errors in measurements throughout the model. For Aim 2, we will develop Bayesian machine learning tools to predict host status from microbiome dynamics. The tools will learn easily interpretable, human-readable rules that predict host status from microbiome time-series data, and will be further extended to handle a variety of longitudinal study designs. For Aim 3, we will engineer our microbiome dynamics analysis software tools for optimal performance, ease-of- use, maintainability, extensibility, and dissemination to the community. In total, the proposed work will yield a suite of contemporary software tools for analyzing microbiome dynamics, with expected broad use and major impact. The software will allow investigators to answer important scientific and translational questions about the microbiome, including discovering which microbial taxa or their metagenomes are affected over time by perturbations such as changes in diet or invasion by pathogens; predicting the effects of these perturbations over time, including changes in composition or stability of the gut microbiota; and finding temporal signatures in multi-‘omic microbiome data that predict disease risk in the human host. The human microbiota, or collection of micro-organisms living on and within us, plays an important role in health, and when disrupted or abnormal, may contribute to many types of diseases including infections, kidney diseases, bowel diseases, diabetes, heart diseases, arthritis, allergies, brain diseases, and cancer. Sophisticated computer-based tools are needed to make sense of human microbiota data, particularly time- series data, which can yield important insights into how our microbiomes change over time. This work will develop new and improved computer-based tools for analyzing microbiota time-series data, which will be made freely available and will enable scientists to increase our fundamental knowledge about how our microbiota affect us and ultimately to apply this knowledge to prevent and treat human illnesses.",Bayesian Machine Learning Tools for Analyzing Microbiome

"Reactome IDG portal: Pathway-based analysis and visualization of understudied human proteins Project Summary Proteins function through interactions with other proteins and biological entities to form biological pathways inside and between cells. Targeted therapies are designed to mitigate or reverse malfunctions caused by mutations in proteins via providing drugs to recover normal biological pathways’ activities. Projecting understudied proteins in the context of biological pathways is a powerful way to infer potential functions of these proteins. Pathway-based approaches are now routinely applied in bioinformatics and computational biology data analysis and visualization. Pathway databases are essential for those approaches. During the past two decades, our team has been working together on building the Reactome knowledgebase, arguably the most popular and comprehensive open source biological pathway database, covering over half of human protein-coding genes and widely used in the research community. In this application, we propose to develop a Reactome IDG pathway portal, which will allow localization of understudied proteins in biological pathways, identifying likely interactions with better-known proteins in specific processes annotated in Reactome, pinpointing most effective drug targets via pathway modeling, thus generating testable predictions of molecular functions of these proteins in key domains of biology. Specially we will develop a web-based application to place understudied proteins in the context of Reactome pathways by importing a variety of data types collected in the IDG projects and other resources and then overlaying them onto the Reactome pathways by leveraging existing Reactome software tools (e.g. interaction overlay). Furthermore, we will develop a machine learning approach to predict functional interactions between understudied proteins and well-known Reactome annotated proteins and a Boolean network-based fuzzy logic modeling approach to integrate the scores produced from the machine learning approach to simulate the impacts of understudied proteins on pathways’ activities. We believe our approach will provide a unique and powerful approach to help the community to understand the contribution of the understudied proteins to cellular functions. Project Narrative Projecting understudied proteins in the context of biological pathways provides a framework to understand potential functions of these proteins.

"Next generation mosquito control through technology-driven trap development and artificial intelligence guided detection of mosquito breeding habitats Project Summary Each year, approximately 400 million people are infected with an arboviral disease from the bite of an Aedes spp mosquito. Aedes spp. mosquitoes are a leading public health threat due to their high competency to vector multiple pathogens, their preference to bite humans, and their ability to adapt to new domestic environments. In the US, reintroduction and establishment of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquito populations has resulted in local epidemics of Zika, dengue and chikungunya in the past decade. Unfortunately, mosquito control programs in the US generally operate with limited budgets, forcing the majority of insecticide spraying to be conducted in reaction to population exposure instead of targeted prevention, which has also contributed to considerable growth of insecticide resistant populations, yielding a widening gap of infrastructure vulnerability. Our current proposal aims to leverage existing technologies from non-health disciplines to advance mosquito detection and abatement. We propose to validate the use of technology-driven mosquito traps that allow for high- throughput identification and counting of Aedes mosquitos at various life stages to inform decision making when selecting areas for insecticide spraying and abatement. Additionally, we propose to develop rigorous remote sensing workflows for identification of neighborhood-level Aedes abundance risk and rapid detection of individual Aedes mosquito breeding habitats on a household-level. This innovative proposal uses multi-year and real-world mosquito data from two different metropolitan areas to statistically adjust for variances in geographic ecologies, urban microclimates, seasonal climate patterns, and annual weather events. Our study will result in low-cost tools immediately ready for broad distribution and integration by vector control agencies nationally. The outcomes of our study have promise to directly impact vector control agency’s decision-making processes for mosquito trapping site selection, inform preventative abetment protocols, and shorten the time required for mosquito collection and identification. Further, integration of our proposed technology traps and informed site selection maps will increase overall collection volumes while preserving scarce resources for local vector control agencies. This proposal has the potential to create a paradigm shift in how we approach vector control globally, with a targeted intervention resulting in significant economic, environmental, and clinical benefits. Project Narrative Mosquito-borne diseases are a global concern that impact public health, tourism, and natural disaster recovery efforts. With no preventative vaccines or effective therapeutic option available for most mosquito-borne diseases, vector control efforts are the only combative option; however, these efforts are often limited by financial constraint and insecticide resistance concern. This proposed project aims to integrate cutting-edge mosquito collection traps, and novel remote sensing and machine learning workflows to guide local vector operations and direct abatement efforts in a cost-efficient manner.",Next generation mosquito control through technology-driven trap development and artificial intelligence guided detection of mosquito breeding habitats,10339610,R01AI165560,"['Aedes ', ' Algorithms ', ' Aptitude ', ' Arbovirus Infections ', ' Arboviral infections ', ' Arthropod-Born Viral Infection ', ' arboviral disease ', ' arbovirus disease ', ' arthropod-borne disease ', ' arthropod-borne infection ', ' arthropodborne disease ', ' arthropodborne infection ', ' Arboviruses ', ' Arboviral ', ' Arthropod-Borne Viruses ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Bite ', ' Human Bites ', ' Breeding ', ' Budgets ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' chikungunya ', ' Chikungunya virus ', ' CHIKV ', ' Cities ', ' Climate ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Comparative Study ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Dengue ', ' Dengue Virus ', ' Breakbone Fever Virus ', ' Dengue fever virus ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Ecology ', ' Bionomics ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Epidemic ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Gases ', ' Geography ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Industry ', ' Insecticide Resistance ', ' insecticide resistant ', ' Insecticides ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Microclimate ', ' Mosquito Control ', ' Culicidae ', ' Mosquitoes ', ' Natural Disasters ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Oils ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Robotics ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Toy ', ' Weather ', ' Competence ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Evaluation ', ' wasting ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration ', ' NASA ', ' National Aeronautics and Space Administration ', ' Environmental Impact ', ' Ecological impact ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Side ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Reaction ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Mosquito-borne disease ', ' Mosquito-borne infectious disease ', ' preference ', ' participatory sensing ', ' remote sensing ', ' metropolitan ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' Modeling ', ' Habitats ', ' Abate ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Sentinel ', ' Compost ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Surveillance Methods ', ' Collection ', ' Security ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' vector control ', ' vector ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' rapid detection ', ' next generation ', ' climate change ', ' global climate change ', ' Outcome ', ' cost efficient ', ' pathogen ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' weather patterns ', ' high risk ', ' combat ', ' operation ', ' atmospheric sciences ', ' atmospheric research ', ' atmospheric studies ', ' Zika Virus ', ' ZIKV ', ' zikav ', ' Preventive vaccine ', ' Preventative vaccine ', ' Prophylactic vaccine ', ' predictive signature ', ' Gravid ', ' preservation ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Visualization ', ' ZIKA ', ' data standards ', ' data standardization ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' meteorological data ', ' weather data ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R01,2021,782998,SC-06
"Integrating multi-omics data: Modeling biomarkers and mechanisms to reduce bacterial vaginosis recurrence Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is characterized by a vaginal microbiota with a low abundance of Lactobacillus spp. and higher abundances of anaerobic bacteria and affects nearly 30% of reproductive-age North American women and closer to 50% of sub-Saharan African women. BV is diagnosed by clinical observation of Amsel’s criteria (Amsel-BV), but treatment is only recommended when symptoms are reported, leaving a significant proportion of women untreated. Even with treatment, BV recurrence rates range from 50-70% within 6 months, increasing a woman’s risk of negative sequelae. Regardless of symptoms, BV is associated with serious adverse health outcomes, including preterm birth and HIV, and can seriously impact a woman’s quality of life. Ideal BV treatment would eliminate recurrence. The vaginal microbiome and microenvironment together provide a detailed evaluation of BV states, and hold key functional insights to predict and understand Amsel-BV recurrence. The goal of this proposal is to integrate and operationalize microbiome (metagenomes) and microenvironment (metabolomes and immune markers) data to develop a prognostic indicator of recurrent BV, and identify candidate biomarkers and causal mechanisms which reduce recurrence. Recent work by the PI functionally categorized the vaginal microbiome for use in large clinical research studies (vaginal metagenomic community state types, mgCSTs). The broad hypothesis in this proposal is that not all microbiomes associated with bacterial vaginosis have the same potential for recurrence. Preliminary data suggest that BV recurrence is more frequently observed in only two of the nine mgCSTs containing BV-associated bacteria. This study proposes to utilize archived cervicovaginal samples from the NIH 1999 Longitudinal Study of Vaginal Flora in which participants were followed quarterly for one year. Multi-omic analyses of baseline samples will be assessed to identify microbial (metagenomic and metabolomic) and host (metabolomic and targeted immune markers) signatures of susceptibility to recurrent BV. Specific aims of this proposal are to: (1) conduct an epidemiological analysis to evaluate the demographic and lifestyle correlates of mgCSTs, and (2) employ supervised machine learning and causal inference modeling to identify prognostic factors and drivers of the vaginal microbiome and microenvironment which lead to recurrent BV. Cases are defined as women with Amsel-BV at baseline, then clearance 3 months later, followed by recurrence at six months. Controls are women with Amsel-BV that do not experience recurrence within 9 months. This grant will support the PI’s training in epidemiology and biostatistics with the completion of a Certificate Program in Clinical Research. The PI’s long- term goal is to create an independent research program translating the basic science of the vaginal microbiome to improve women’s reproductive health outcomes. The Institute for Genome Sciences and the University of Maryland School of Medicine uniquely provide the resources and support required for successful completion of this proposal and the PI’s transition to an independent investigator. Emerging data suggest that a woman’s vaginal microbiome can protect her from acquisition of sexually transmitted infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, and risk of pre-term delivery. This project will reveal how certain bacterial strains and concomitant host immune responses are associated with the recurrence bacterial vaginosis. This proposal will provide career development for the PI in clinical research, biostatistics, and epidemiology, and is relevant to the NIH’s mission to reduce infections and promote women’s health.",Integrating multi-omics data: Modeling biomarkers and mechanisms to reduce bacterial vaginosis recurrence,10282850,K01AI163413,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Archives ', ' Award ', '

"Mayo Clinic HeartShare Clinical Center PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This is Mayo Clinic’s application to participate in the NIH HeartShare Research Consortium as a HeartShare Clinical Center (CC). Our goal is to collaborate with the other HeartShare Investigators to elucidate the pathophysiology of heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and discover novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Multiple pathophysiologic processes may ultimately lead to different HFpEF phenotypes, though the specific mechanisms remain largely undefined. It is also not known whether standard clinical information can identify patients with different mechanistic etiologies, which is necessary to provide targeted therapies in clinical trials and eventually in clinical practice. Our proposal outlines four specific aims. In Specific Aim 1: We document that Mayo Clinic has the resources and the Mayo HeartShare Team has the expertise and track record of productivity in HFpEF and relevant related diseases, clinical research, patient recruitment and retention, data science, and collaborative team science to help drive the success of HeartShare Network. In Specific Aim 2: We propose a broad mechanistic phenotyping protocol providing quantitative variables reflective of senescence, systemic disease processes, and multi-organ integrity (L2 data), which are used as input variables in unsupervised machine learning (ML) models. We hypothesize that this approach will allow identification of unique HFpEF pathophysiologic phenogroups (clusters). We also propose invasive hemodynamic signatures, trans-cardiac gradients of circulating biomarkers and myocardial, adipose and skeletal muscle tissue characterization (L3 data) be obtained in a subset within each HFpEF pathophysiologic phenogroup. We hypothesize these L3 data will enhance identification of targeted therapeutic strategies. Lastly, we outline supervised ML using EHR data to develop automatable algorithms to accurately identify the HeartShare HFpEF pathophysiological phenogroups derived using L2 data. We hypothesize that if successful, this approach will enhance translation of HeartShare findings by allowing automated identification of patients in the different HFpEF phenogroups for enrollment in clinical trials of agents targeting their specific pathophysiology. In Specific Aim 3: We propose that use of circulating proteins alone (n=5000; defined by the SOMAScanTM Aptamer based platform) as input variables for unsupervised ML models will identify unique HFpEF pathophysiologic phenotypes (clusters). In Specific Aim 4: We outline the Mayo HeartShare Research Skills Development Program. Providing HFpEF clinical investigators a short-term intensive immersion experience by collaboration with a data scientist intern in the Mayo Cardiovascular Disease AI Internship or a long term dedicated program in data science as a Mayo Kern Center Scholar in Data Science will equip a new generation of HFpEF investigators with a robust data science toolbox to drive future discovery. PROJECT NARRATIVE/ LAY SUMMARY This proposal represents Mayo Clinic’s application to participate in the HeartShare Research Consortium, a program established by the National Institutes of Health. This team science initiative will be enabled by advances in data science and focus on determining the causes of heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

"Structural, Biochemical and Functional Connectivity in Osteoarthritis using Quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Skeletal Biomechanics Osteoarthritis (OA), a multifactorial disease that causes joint degeneration, affects 27 million U.S. adults, and often leads to severe disability. The prevalence of OA is 33.6% in adults older than 65 years. Despite the fact that OA is a widespread and debilitating disease, treatment options are currently extremely limited, and established disease-modifying therapies do not exist. The solution generally offered to treat late stage, symptomatic knee OA is joint replacement (total knee/hip arthroplasty, TKA/THA), and while this surgically invasive and expensive remedy offers temporary relief, replacements often fail after 10-15 years, with shorter life spans in obese individuals. In order to reduce the number of TKA/THA procedures, preventive efforts and interventions targeting early stage OA are essential – the first step would be identifying subjects at high risk for disease development, at a stage when tissue is not yet lost, and cartilage matrix abnormalities are potentially reversible. Understanding the complex pathophysiology of joint degeneration, knee and hip joint interactions, impact of gait biomechanics, are all critical to determine the mechanistic basis of hip OA.  Hip OA progression marked by changes in cartilage biochemistry has complex multi-joint interactions with several mechanistic factors, including morphological features, gait biomechanics and demographics. However, studies to date have mostly focused on the relationship between single mechanistic factors and semi-quantitative/ quantitative imaging measures, gait biomechanics, or non-objective symptomatic evidence of hip OA. The overall goal of this competitive renewal is to extend our longitudinal work to determine the structure-function-connectivity and mechanistic factors that mediate biochemical degeneration of hip cartilage associated with OA progression over the mid-term (6-8-year) period.  In this proposal, subjects will be recruited for a longitudinal study (covering 5-8 year follow up) from our existing cohort (n=184 hips, 92 subjects), with the availability of existing 3-year follow-up data including bi- lateral hip radiographs and MR images, gait biomechanics and patient reported outcomes. We will use novel, fully automated and translational methods to measure MRI-based T1ρ and T2 relaxation time on a voxel basis, which will provide precise and localized information on cartilage proteoglycan and collagen integrity and water content. Automatic segmentation techniques combined with machine learning algorithms will be used to analyze cartilage T1ρ/T2 in a well-characterized dataset with quantifiable T1ρ/T2 values on a voxel-level, and to automatically detect the patterns of focal T1ρ/T2 elevations that lead to later stage OA and drive progression of degenerative disease (over 8 years). Detailed analysis of gait biomechanics using functional principal component analysis will utilize the rich skeletal biomechanics data and imaging (over 8 years). Imaging the knee and hip longitudinally will provide a multi-joint analysis of OA progression (over 4 years) not done previously and will provide unique insights in the mechanisms in hip OA, connections with knee changes. Osteoarthritis (OA), a multifactorial disease and understanding the complex pathophysiology of joint degeneration, knee and hip joint interactions, and the impact of gait biomechanics, are all critical to determine the mechanistic basis of hip OA. In this proposal subjects will be recruited for a longitudinal study (covering 5-8 year follow up) from our existing cohort and we will use novel, fully automated and translational methods to measure MRI-based measures of cartilage degeneration and determine the role of gait biomechanics on disease progression.","Structural, Biochemical and Functional Connectivity in Osteoarthritis using

"Global and Local Genetic Ancestry Impacts on Differential Outcome of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Multiple Sclerosis PROJECT SUMMARY The objective of our study is to identify ancestry related genetic variants contributing to differential risk of manifestations of both systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and multiple sclerosis (MS) in subjects of different genetic ancestries. SLE is an autoimmune disease with heterogenous features characterized by autoantibody formation and MS is an immune-mediated, demyelinating disorder. We will investigate the association between genetic ancestry and clinical outcomes of SLE and MS that are known to differ in prevalence and severity between SLE or MS patients of different races. Outcomes for SLE will include age of onset, autoantibody status, and lupus nephritis. Outcomes for MS will include age of onset, cognitive impairment, and MS severity score. We will study ~4,000 SLE and MS cases. In Aim 1, we will use ~2,000 SLE cases from the UCSF Lupus Genetics Study and California Lupus Epidemiology Study (CLUES) and ~2,000 MS cases from the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) MS Research Program and Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) MS Sunshine Study to investigate the association of global ancestry and the outcomes of interest for SLE and MS. In Aim 2, we will investigate the association of local ancestry genome-wide and of candidate SLE and MS SNPs with the same clinical outcomes. In Aim 3, we will test for the association between both active and passive tobacco smoking and respective outcomes as well as test for gene-environment interaction between active and passive smoking and global and local ancestry. By establishing whether global and local genetic ancestry contribute to clinical heterogeneity and severity of SLE and MS, or if there are differences in gene-environment interaction with environmental exposures such as smoking, we might be able to target patients based on risk of disease outcomes by evaluating genetic ancestry of admixed patients. It might also be possible to predict disease manifestations and allow for early intervention and improved targeted treatment strategies limiting severity of disease and improving quality of life. This research project and associated training plan were developed in collaboration with my sponsor, Dr. Lisa Barcellos, co-sponsors, Drs. Lindsey Criswell and Laura Fejerman, and collaborators, Drs. Andres Cardenas and Priya Moorjani. The training plan emphasizes scientific productivity and building a strong knowledge of epidemiologic, biostatistical, and computational methods, as well as immunology and SLE and MS autoimmune disease processes. As a student at UC Berkeley, I am well supported by an institution that values rigorous scientific research and have access to many research and professional resources. Ultimately, the proposed research and achievement of the goals outlined in the training plan will allow me to become a multidisciplinary, independent investigator and facilitate my transition into a post-doctoral position and early-investigator faculty or research position. PROJECT NARRATIVE Autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and multiple sclerosis (MS) have debilitating clinical features which vary between different ancestral populations. Since disease manifestations may differ by genetic ancestry, understanding the effect of genetic ancestry and interactions with active and passive tobacco smoking exposure on clinical outcomes of SLE and MS is an important step towards predicting disease outcomes and allowing for early intervention and treatment for different ancestral populations.",Global and Local Genetic Ancestry Impacts on

"Sample-specific Models for Molecular Portraits of Diseases in Precision Medicine A fundamental challenge in precision medicine is to understand the patterns of differentiation between individuals. To address this challenge, we propose to go beyond the traditional `one disease--one model' view of bioinformatics and pursue a new view built upon personalized patient models that facilitates precision medicine by leveraging both commonalities within a patient cohort as well as signatures unique to every individual patient. With the emergence of large-scale databases such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), which collect multi-omic data on many different diseases, a new “pan-omics” and “pan-disease” paradigm has emerged to jointly analyze all patients in a disease cohort while accounting for patient-specific effects. An example of this is the recently released Pan-Cancer Atlas. At the same time, next generation statistical tools to accurately and rigorously draw the necessary inferences are lacking. In this project we propose a series of mathematically rigorous, statistically sound, and computationally feasible approaches to infer sample-specific models, providing a more complete view of heterogeneous datasets. By bringing together ideas from the machine learning, statistics, and mathematical optimization communities, we provide a rigorous framework for precision medicine via sample-specific statistical models. Crucially, we propose to analyze this framework and prove strong theoretical guarantees under weak assumptions--this dramatically distinguishes our framework from much of the existing literature. Towards these goals, we propose the following aims: Aim 1: Discovery of new molecular profiles with sample-specific statistical models. We propose a general framework for inferring sample-specific models with low-rank structure based on the novel concept of distance-matching. This allows us to infer statistical models at the level of a single patient without overfitting, and is general enough to be applied for prediction, classification, and network inference as well as a variety of diseases and phenotypes. Aim 2: Multimodal approaches to personalized diagnosis--contextually interpretable models for actionable clinical decision support. In order to translate these models into practice, we propose a novel interpretable predictive model that supports complex, multimodal data types such as images and text combined with high-level interpretable features such as SNP data, gender, age, etc. This framework simultaneously boosts the accuracy of clinical predictions by exploiting sample heterogeneity while providing human-digestable explanations for the predictions being made. Aim 3: Next-generation precision medicine--algorithms and software for personalized estimation. To put our models into practical use, we will develop new algorithms for interpretable prediction of personalized clinical outcomes and visualization of personalized statistical models. All of our tools will be combined into a user-friendly software package called PrecisionX that will be freely available to researchers and clinicians everywhere. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Personalization with data is a critical challenge whenever decisions must be made at scale, and has applications that go beyond precision medicine; businesses, educational institutions, and financial institutions are among the many players that have acknowledged a stake in this complex problem. We expect the proposed work to provide a rigorous foundation for personalization with large and high-dimensional datasets, finding use throughout the broader scientific community as well as with industry and educational institutions. Alongside our collaboration with Pitt/UPMC, we will work with physicians and data scientists for practical feedback as well as provide training in the methods developed.

"Opening the Black Box of Machine Learning Models Project Summary Biomedical data is vastly increasing in quantity, scope, and generality, expanding opportunities to discover novel biological processes and clinically translatable outcomes. Machine learning (ML), a key technology in modern biology that addresses these changing dynamics, aims to infer meaningful interactions among variables by learning their statistical relationships from data consisting of measurements on variables across samples. Accurate inference of such interactions from big biological data can lead to novel biological discoveries, therapeutic targets, and predictive models for patient outcomes. However, a greatly increased hypothesis space, complex dependencies among variables, and complex “black-box” ML models pose complex, open challenges. To meet these challenges, we have been developing innovative, rigorous, and principled ML techniques to infer reliable, accurate, and interpretable statistical relationships in various kinds of biological network inference problems, pushing the boundaries of both ML and biology. Fundamental limitations of current ML techniques leave many future opportunities to translate inferred statistical relationships into biological knowledge, as exemplified in a standard biomarker discovery problem – an extremely important problem for precision medicine. Biomarker discovery using high-throughput molecular data (e.g., gene expression data) has significantly advanced our knowledge of molecular biology and genetics. The current approach attempts to find a set of features (e.g., gene expression levels) that best predict a phenotype and use the selected features, or molecular markers, to determine the molecular basis for the phenotype. However, the low success rates of replication in independent data and of reaching clinical practice indicate three challenges posed by current ML approach. First, high-dimensionality, hidden variables, and feature correlations create a discrepancy between predictability (i.e., statistical associations) and true biological interactions; we need new feature selection criteria to make the model better explain rather than simply predict phenotypes. Second, complex models (e.g., deep learning or ensemble models) can more accurately describe intricate relationships between genes and phenotypes than simpler, linear models, but they lack interpretability. Third, analyzing observational data without conducting interventional experiments does not prove causal relations. To address these problems, we propose an integrated machine learning methodology for learning interpretable models from data that will: 1) select interpretable features likely to provide meaningful phenotype explanations, 2) make interpretable predictions by estimating the importance of each feature to a prediction, and 3) iteratively validate and refine predictions through interventional experiments. For each challenge, we will develop a generalizable ML framework that focuses on different aspects of model interpretability and will therefore be applicable to any formerly intractable, high-impact healthcare problems. We will also demonstrate the effectiveness of each ML framework for a wide range of topics, from basic science to disease biology to bedside applications. Project Narrative The development of effective computational methods that can extract meaningful and interpretable signals from noisy, big data has become an integral part of biomedical research, which aims to discover novel biological processes and clinically translatable outcomes. The proposed research seeks to radically shift the current paradigm in data-driven discovery from “learning a statistical model that best fits specific training data” to “learning an explainable model” for a wide range of topics, from basic science to disease biology to bedside applications. Successful completion of this project will result in novel biological discoveries, therapeutic targets, predictive models for patient outcomes, and powerful computational frameworks generalizable to critical problems in various diseases.",Opening the Black Box of Machine Learning Models,10224845,R35GM128638,"['Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Linear Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Modernization ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Technology ', ' Translating ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Measurement ', ' Selection Criteria ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Techniques ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' therapeutic target ', ' molecular marker ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' clinical practice ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' inquiry-based learning ', ' discovery learning ', ' inquiry-based instruction ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' biomarker discovery ', ' clinically translatable ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' high dimensionality ', ' deep learning ', ' feature selection ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R35,2021,388750,WA-07
"Functional Determinants in G-Protein-Coupled Receptors FUNCTIONAL DETERMINANTS OF G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The long-term goal of this work is to rationally manipulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCRs) activation with the hope to develop novel therapeutic approaches in this major family of transmembrane receptors and drug targets. Our hypothesis is that evolutionary divergence patterns can reveal the roles that GPCR sequence positions play, individually or together, in order to mediate ligand binding, allosteric conformational switching, and finally ligand-biased activation of efferent signaling pathways, which can be G protein-dependent or independent. In the past funding period, computational analysis of such evolutionary patterns revealed: Intramolecular allosteric communication in the transmembrane domain of dopamine D2R receptor; Modular components of an allosteric switch controlling B2AR functional selectivity; A new non-canonical cAMP- independent signaling pathway in that same receptor; and Ligand specificity determinants in the extracellular domain of metabotropic glutamate receptors (MGluR). Technical progress led to: increased accuracy to assess the impact of coding mutations in proteins through a first-principle equation for the evolutionary variations of genotype and phenotype; The generalization of our analyses of evolutionary divergence to consider co-varying residues; and new methods to unravel complex simultaneous assay readouts to stratify drug effects on GPCRs. Together these and other data support new aims that combine biological and algorithmic goals: 1. To titrate mutationally the signaling bias of bioamine receptors. 2. To uncover allosteric mediators in metabotropic glutamate receptors. 3. To identify a systematic role of GPCR mutations in cancer. The outcome should reveal new aspects of the molecular basis of signaling in an important family of pharmaceutical targets. It will also link sequence and structure genomics databases to the molecular basis of function and to the rational re- design of protein function–key steps towards manipulating cellular pathways. FUNCTIONAL DETERMINANTS OF G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS Narrative of the project G protein-coupled receptors account for nearly half of all current medications, yet so far relatively few have been successfully targeted by drugs. One of the difficulties is that we have limited knowledge of their mechanisms at a detailed level. This proposal attempts to uncover the mechanisms of these proteins so that in the longer term we can design new drugs that block their role in diseases, including in cancer.",Functional Determinants

"Symptom Cluster of Midlife Menopausal Women with Metabolic Syndrome ABSTRACT Metabolic syndrome (MS) refers to a cluster of metabolic abnormalities that includes hypertension, central obesity, insulin resistance, and atherogenic dyslipidemia. It has been associated with a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and myocardial infarction. It is estimated that more than one third of the U.S. population meets criteria for MS. Specifically, its prevalence is higher in women than in men with currently 2 million more women being affected in the United States. Individuals with MS experience multiple symptoms such as pain, sleep disturbance, and altered mood that affect patient outcomes. While research often focuses on single symptoms. it is rare that an individual with a chronic condition presents with a single symptom but rather experiences multiple symptoms or symptom clusters. However, little is known about symptom clusters in this population. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to understand the complex symptom experience of midlife menopausal women with MS. This study aims to: 1) identify symptom clusters in midlife menopausal women with MS and key symptom(s) that exert influence on symptom clusters, 2) explore symptom experience trajectory over time to classify midlife menopausal women with MS with distinct symptom experience and identify subgroup at high-risk for greater symptom burden over time using symptom clusters, and 3) examine individual characteristics associated with each symptom cluster subgroup membership. This retrospective, descriptive longitudinal study will use existing data from the Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation (SWAN) from Baseline to Visit 10. Machine learning based network analysis (NA) will be used to identify symptom clusters and key symptoms that exert influence within and among symptom clusters. Growth Mixture Model (GMM) will be used to classify midlife menopausal women with MS with distinct symptom experience and identify subgroup at high-risk for greater symptom burden. Regression model will be used to examine individual characteristics associated with each symptom cluster subgroup membership. The proposed study is in response to National Institute of Nursing Research Strategic Plan in Symptom Science. It will assist in providing quantitative visualization and interpretation of the relationships among symptoms and symptom clusters and identifying key symptom(s) through machine learning based network analysis that may serve as a potential target for future interventions. It will also identify subgroups at high risk for greater symptom burden and their associated individual characteristics that will inform future development of targeted symptom interventions for different risk groups. Findings from this study will inform the next stage of symptom science research through application of new analytic techniques and clinical application to manage symptom clusters and key symptoms in midlife menopausal women with MS. PROJECT NARRATIVE Metabolic syndrome is a global public health problem and is prevalent in midlife menopausal women. This study seeks to understand the complex symptom experience of midlife menopausal women with metabolic syndrome.

"A multi-modality approach to decode epithelial heterogeneity and function in metaplasia 1) Background, key gaps in our understanding, and important challenges to be addressed. In response to injury, differentiated adult secretory cells in the gastrointestinal tract undergo metaplasia, or the conversion of one cell type to another. In the pancreas, this is called `acinar to ductal metaplasia' (ADM) and it is thought to function in tissue regeneration. The goals of our laboratory are to generate tools to understand the process of ADM, to identify the consortium of ADM cell types that emerge, and to determine their physiological role in tissue injury. 2) Description of recent progress by the PI. By the end of her post-doctoral work, the PI showed that differentiated, secretory cell types, such as tuft cells, form in the pancreas in response to ADM (DelGiorno et al. Frontiers in Physiology, 2020). Tuft cells are solitary chemosensory cells with myriad roles in mediating inflammation. Combining RNA sequencing, electron microscopy (EM), and mouse models of disease, she identified a functional role for tuft cells, the first description in any model of tumorigenesis (DelGiorno et al. Gastroenterology, 2020). Using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and EM, she has identified the formation of several additional secretory cell populations in ADM of unknown function, which are now being studied in the DelGiorno laboratory. 3) Overview of future research program. We propose to continue our work on ADM by creating a workflow combining Single cell RNA-seq and EM Analysis (SEMA) to study epithelial heterogeneity in pancreatic injury with and without the genetic manipulation of identified cell types. Volumetric electron microscopy (3DEM) will be used as a substrate on which to map the information provided by scRNA-seq to reveal the spatial relationships between cells and infer the function of individual cell types through the study of their organellar content. Our approach leverages scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to conduct a variety of experiments on the same tissue including: [1] imaging of dehydrated whole-mount samples, [2] wide-field “chip mapping” of large areas of ultrathin sections, and [3] large-scale serial section approaches for 3DEM acquisition. Mapping is enhanced using correlative light and electron microscopy to assign molecular markers identified in scRNA-seq by immunofluorescence to cells with defining characteristics in SEM (e.g., nuclear shape, distribution of mitochondria, etc). Our 3DEM datasets are amenable to high-throughput image processing (e.g., segmentation, geometry processing) using machine learning and deep learning tool kits. Together, these tools provide a novel discovery workflow, which will be applied to projects throughout our laboratory aimed at evaluating cellular heterogeneity in ADM. Our goals for the next five years are to use this SEMA approach to build a multi-dimensional atlas of the cellular content and spatial relationships of the various emergent cell types in ADM. Mouse models lacking individual ADM cell subtypes will be used to assess phenotypic effects on cellular makeup, relative positioning, and disease progression. Together, these studies will provide invaluable insight into the role of ADM in tissue healing and regeneration in the pancreas. Technological advances in single cell RNA sequencing platforms have rapidly advanced our understanding of cellular heterogeneity within complex multicellular organ systems, however validating these data remain a major challenge. Ultrastructural electron microscopy is the gold standard for cell type identification by recognition of definitive physical features, however sample preparation and analysis are arduous and low- throughput.

"Protein structure determination from low-resolution experimental data Project Abstract Determination of a protein’s three-dimensional structure is of critical importance in biology, providing insights to biological mechanisms and important targets for drug design. While high- resolution X-ray diffraction data provides an atomic view of cellular components, for many interesting and biologically relevant complexes, it may only be possible to obtain low-resolution structural information. Both cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, when applied to large, flexible molecular machines, often produce data of 3-6 Å resolution. Extracting detailed atomic information from this data, critical in understanding function, the effects of mutation, or in designing drugs is impossible due to the low number of observations and the large conformational space proteins may adopt. I propose to develop computational methods for extracting high-resolution atomic models from this low-resolution data, bridging the “resolution gap” with computational methods. My proposed research develops and extends our labs’ methods for automatically inferring atomic accuracy models, from these “near-atomic” resolution sources of experimental data. We develop novel conformational sampling methods, guided by experimental data, to infer atomic information both in cases where homologous high-resolution data is available, and where it is not. Additionally, we propose development of methods for estimating model uncertainty; these are critical in understanding to what degree structural conclusions may be made from a particular dataset. Finally, in pushing the resolution limit further, we develop general tools for biomolecular forcefield optimization. These machine-learning tools will allow development of a next-generation forcefield, critical in extending the resolution limit of data from which we can infer atomic details. The overall goal of the proposed research is robust and accessible methods to determine protein structures to atomic accuracy from only sparse experimental data. Combined, the three aims in this proposal will lead to dramatic improvements in our ability to infer atomic interactions from sparse experimental data. This will lead to determination of structures that will reveal key insights into how biomedically important protein complexes perform their function and what goes wrong in human disease. Project Narrative This project develops computational tools for accurately determining protein structure from low- resolution experimental data.

"Infralimbic circuit control over a sex-dependent switch in threat responding Project Summary Sex differences in the development and prevalence of mental illnesses are widespread, suggesting that the factors that promote disease risk and resilience may be distinct in men and women. The neurobiological mechanisms underlying this possibility are poorly understood, however, because the vast majority of pre- clinical animal research has been conducted in males. In addition, the behavioral outcome measures used to understand learned fear have focused predominantly on passive, or freezing behavior. We recently identified an active, escape-like conditioned fear response in rats (“darting”) that occurred almost exclusively in females and was predictive of improved extinction retention. A better understanding of potentially sexually dimorphic mechanisms that drive this behavior could open new avenues for treatment of disorders that are more prevalent in women, like PTSD. We propose here to define the neural circuitry that drives the selection of conditioned darting vs. freezing, and how that integrates with known extinction circuits to promote extinction retention. Our preliminary data implicate the infralimbic cortex (IL) in this role, and we will use pharmacological, chemogenetic, and viral techniques to probe how descending IL projections to the dorsal and ventral periaqueductal gray (PAG) may mediate a strategic switch between active and passive responding and drive long-term behavioral flexibility through putative collaterals in the amygdala. We will then use sophisticated machine vision and machine learning-based tools to define the broader behavioral repertoires within which darting exists, thereby identifying a multifaceted phenotype that could provide insight into the mechanisms underlying individual differences in stress resilience and vulnerability. Project Narrative Sex differences in the development and prevalence of mental illnesses are widespread, suggesting that the risk factors that promote disease susceptibility may be distinct in men and women.

"Machine Learning and Network Science for Predicting Kidney Transplant Survival  Chronic kidney disease affects about 10% of adults in the United States and 7-12% of the population worldwide. It may lead to irreversible loss of kidney function, known as end-stage renal disease (ESRD). For patients with ESRD, kidney transplantation is the preferred treatment compared to dialysis in terms of patient survival, quality of life and cost. Despite the advantages of kidney transplants, most patients with ESRD are treated with dialysis primarily because there exist an insufficient number of compatible donors for patients. The human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) of the organ donor and recipient are known to be a significant contributing factor to transplanted organ survival times due to immunogenicity, the immune response of the recipient to the transplanted organ. Mismatches between donor and recipient HLAs are associated with shorter survival times; however, it is extremely rare to identify donors that have a perfect match with recipients, so most transplants involve mismatched HLAs. Our main objective is to accurately predict survival times for kidney transplants by incorporating both data- driven models of HLA compatibility based on outcomes of past transplants and biologically-driven models of HLA immunogenicity. Accurate prediction of survival times can improve patient transplant outcomes by enabling more efficient allocation of donors and recipients, particularly by reducing the number of repeat transplants due to graft failure with a poorly matched donor. We propose to estimate HLA compatibilities using high-dimensional variable selection techniques applied to outcomes of past transplants and through a novel donor-recipient latent space model for the HLA compatibility network. We then propose to incorporate these predicted compatibilities along with biologically-driven models of HLA immunogenicity using amino acid sequences and epitopes into a multi-task classification-based survival prediction algorithm. Our proposed approach for learning integrated data- and biologically-driven models of transplant survival generalizes broadly to organ transplantation (liver, heart, pancreas, lungs) and possibly to bone marrow transplantation. Finding better methods for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching between donor and recipient may redefine and improve clinical outcomes for organ and tissue transplants. In fact, new approach may revolutionize the selection of donors with recipients, thereby producing significantly improved long-term organ and tissue transplant survivals.",Machine Learning and Network Science for Predicting Kidney Transplant Survival ,10221053,R01LM013311,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Amino Acid Sequence ', ' Primary Protein Structure ', ' protein sequence ', ' Epitopes ', ' Antigenic Determinants ', ' Binding Determinants ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' Anus ', ' Anal ', ' Bone Marrow Transplantation ', ' Bone Marrow Grafting ', ' Bone Marrow Transplant ', ' Marrow Transplantation ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Dialysis ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Heart ', ' HLA Antigens ', ' HL-A Antigens ', ' Human Leukocyte Antigens ', ' Leukocyte Antigens ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Renal Grafting ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' kidney tx ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Methods ', ' Organ Donor ', ' Organ Survival ', ' Organ Transplantation ', ' Grafting Procedure ', ' Organ Transplants ', ' organ allograft ', ' organ graft ', ' organ xenograft ', ' Pancreas ', ' Pancreatic ', ' Patients ', ' Plants ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Science ', ' Time ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' United States ', ' Tissue Transplantation ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' Space Models ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' transplant patient ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' Techniques ', ' hazard ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Donor Screening ', ' Donor Selection ', ' Data ', ' cost ', ' immunogenicity ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' multitask ', ' multi-task ', ' graft failure ', ' learning network ', ' discrete time ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' survival prediction ', ' predict survival ', ' predictor of survival ', ' high dimensionality ', ' human model ', ' model of human ', ' transplant model ', ' treatment comparison ', ' compare treatment ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO,R01,2021,277764,OH-09
"Synthetic biology and organelle genomics: A rubisco library as a case study in evolutionary landscapes and organellar engineering Food security is a critical issue facing human health in the 21st century as the global population  approaches 10 billion and climate change threatens the food supply. Photosynthetic engineering has  been successful in improving crop yields but the central enzyme of carbon fixation, rubisco, has  remained intractable as a target of molecular evolution. The few plants tested with heterologous  rubiscos grow uniformly slower than their wild-type counterparts. The goal of this proposal is to  generate a chloroplast genome library in plants to explore the limits of rubisco function and  organellar genome organization. In Aim 1 of this proposal I will explore the sequence-function landscape of a model, homodimeric  rubisco enzyme and a novel, linked variant I have generated. I have generated a deep-mutational  scan (OMS: all possible point-mutants) library and will assay their function in a uniquely suited  rubisco-dependent E. coli strain. I have shown that these linked rubiscos function in vivo and in  vitro and have already constructed the mutant library; in the K99 phase of this project I will  perform selections on this library and analyze the data with a machine learning model. In the R00  phase I will generate further libraries to explore regions of the sequence landscape predicted to  be rich in improved rubiscos with the goal of testing them in plants. In Aim 2 I will improve chloroplast transformation technology in order to enable the generation of  chloroplast genome libraries of unprecedented size in the chloroplast-editing model plant N.  tabacum. To do this I will generate sequence-specific TALEN nucleases that will be expressed from  the nuclear genome and trafficked to the chloroplast where they will cut and disrupt the genome,  preferencing homologous recombination of transgenic donor ONA. After demonstrating TALEN-cutting in  the K99 phase I will develop this technology into an intracellular gene drive which will accelerate  chloroplast genome editing. In Aim 3, with the technology developed in Aim 2 and the rubisco variants discovered in Aim 1, I  will generate libraries of plants with altered rubisco genes and promoters in order to demonstrate  the potential of rubisco engineering to improve plant growth. In addition, in the R00 phase, I will  produce a comprehensive chloroplast gene knockout library in order to answer fundamental questions  about the evolutionary flow of genes from organellar genomes to nuclear genomes. My goal as an independent investigator is to study organellar biology in model plants in order to  explore the limits of engineering in individual proteins and metabolic pathways. My training in  organellar transformation, protein library generation and laboratory management during the K99  phase will prepare me well for the R00 phase. The Innovative Genomics Institute at UC Berkeley and  the laboratories of Ors. Oavid Savage and Brian Staskawicz in particular are the ideal environment  for my career transition, combining precisely the necessary mixture of expertise - protein  evolution and plant transformation, respectively. The goal of this proposal is to overcome the fundamental limits of the carbon-fixing enzyme rubisco  and to translate that knowledge into improvements in carbon fixation efficiencies in transgenic  plants. By studying a wider array of genes, gene variants and expression levels, the chloroplast  transformation technologies proposed here have the potential to reshape our understanding of the  limits of photosynthetic yield in plants.

"Quantitative and Spectroscopic Imaging of Skeletal Muscle Changes in Sarcopenia at High Field Project Summary Sarcopenia, a condition characterized by loss of muscle mass and function in the elderly, is of increasing relevance in the United States due to its aging population. It is generally agreed that the weakening of the muscle in sarcopenia cannot be explained by loss of muscle mass alone, but the mechanisms behind this remain poorly understood. This is partly due to the lack of non-invasive techniques for observing muscle structure and composition in high detail. We propose to develop MRI techniques to measure muscle morphology, microstructure, and fat content to get a detailed view of the changes in muscle quantity and quality in patients with sarcopenia and how they relate to more easily attainable measurements of muscle function such as grip strength and gait speed. This would provide an important contribution to the ongoing debate about how such measurements could be used to define sarcopenia, which would pave the way for treatment development. We aim to develop novel methods to investigate the structure and composition of muscle using ultra-high-field MRI. Specifically, we aim to (1) obtain water-based images of skeletal muscle macro- and microstructure with unparalleled efficiency, image quality, and resolution; (2) obtain images of the spatial distribution of intramyocellular lipids in skeletal muscle, measuring both methyl and methylene to estimate saturation; and (3) to conduct a study comparing skeletal muscle structure and quality by looking at MR measurements of T2 relaxation rates, diffusivity (as proxies for inflammation and fiber size, respectively), fat fraction, and lipid composition, in subjects with sarcopenia and healthy controls and see how these quantities correlate to muscle function. This project has several innovative aspects. First, we will develop a method to estimate muscle morphology, T2 relaxation rates, and diffusivity with a single MRI sequence. Importantly, this will make the developed method easy to run at other MRI sites. Second, we will devise methods to perform robust, efficient imaging of intramyocellular lipid droplet distribution and saturation in human skeletal muscle in vivo at high field. Both of these methods will have unparalleled signal-to-noise ratio and robustness against image artifacts. The significance of this work is the investigation of the role of inflammation, fiber size, and lipid distribution in the weakening of muscle in sarcopenia and how these measurements are related to muscle function. The resulting conclusions and techniques may help establish a common standard for the definition of sarcopenia and aid in the development of future treatments for this condition. Project Narrative Sarcopenia, the loss of muscle mass and function with age, is a condition bound to increase in prevalence with an aging population. The muscle changes involved include not only reduction in mass but also changes in muscle quality not easily visualized with current methods. This work aims to develop efficient MRI techniques to investigate these changes in better detail, improving scientific understanding of the mechanisms of sarcopenia and how they relate to muscle function.",Quantitative and Spectroscopic Imaging of Skeletal Muscle Changes in Sarcopenia at High Field,10125507,K99AG066815,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Awareness ', ' Communities ', ' Diffusion ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Fracture ', ' bone fracture ', ' Future ', ' Geriatrics ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Inflammation ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Lipids ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Muscular Atrophy ', ' Muscle Atrophy ', ' muscle breakdown ', ' muscle degradation ', ' muscle deterioration ', ' muscle loss ', ' muscle wasting ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Protons ', ' H+ element ', ' Hydrogen Ions ', ' Relaxation ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Spatial Distribution ', ' Spectrum Analysis ', ' Spectroscopy ', ' Spectrum Analyses ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' United States ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Work ', ' carbene ', ' methylene ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' falls ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' bone imaging ', ' bone scanning ', ' skeletal imaging ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Fiber ', ' Muscle function ', ' muscle form ', ' muscle bulk ', ' muscle mass ', ' Measurement ', ' Skeletal Muscle ', ' Voluntary Muscle ', ' Soleus Muscle ', ' Soleus ', ' Hand Strength ', ' Grip strength ', ' Metabolic ', ' Morphology ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' muscle strength ', ' Proxy ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' sarcopenic ', ' sarcopenia ', ' Magnetic Resonance ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Data ', ' Metabolic Marker ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' spectroscopic imaging ', ' imaging spectroscopy ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' therapy development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' aging population ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' muscular structure ', ' muscle structure ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' radio frequency ', ' radiofrequency ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' potential biomarker ', ' potential biological marker ', ' clinical biomarkers ', ' clinically useful biomarkers ', ' Gait speed ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K99,2021,114480,MA-08
"Social Isolation and Discrimination as Stressors Influencing Brain-Gut Microbiome Alterations among Filipino and Mexican American ABSTRACT  Obesity is a major public health problem that is related to a variety of illnesses, such as heart disease and diabetes. Prior research indicates that social stressors contribute to risk for obesity, possibly through alterations in diet and physical activity. However, it is not fully clear how these alterations contribute to obesity. In this study, we examine how the stressors of social isolation and discrimination are related to eating behaviors and dietary patterns, and further, how these behaviors affect the brain-gut-microbiome (BGM) axis. Our prior research has suggested that BGM alterations play an important role in the development of obesity. Our study focuses on Mexican and Filipina women because research shows that they encounter a high burden of obesity as well as exposure to social stressors.  We will screen and enroll approximately 300 Mexican and Filipina women who will then provide information about social stressors via a survey, dietician-administered 24-hour food recall, measured anthropometrics (e.g. waist circumference), questionnaire data regarding diet and eating behaviors, and accelerometer data on physical activity. Stool and serum to determine microbial-related measures (16sRNA sequencing, shotgun metagenomics, and metabolomics), and MRI to assess brain alterations in the extended reward network will be collected. Advanced multivariate analytic techniques will be used to integrate data from multiple data sources (neuroimaging, microbiome and metabolite profiles, survey data, diet, and clinical/behavioral data). This analysis will determine the unique variance associated with ethnicity and social stressors in moderating eating behaviors and dietary patterns, and the BGM axis related to obesity. An integrated systems investigative approach such as the one proposed is a critical step to understanding the mechanisms contributing to obesity. Further the impact of how environmental stressors “get under the skin” and impact eating behaviors and diet patterns and the BGM axis is important in addressing health disparities in ethnic groups and in women. This premise guides the specific aims of this proposal: Aim A: We will phenotype the influence of stressors on brain signatures and eating patterns in obesity. Aim B: We will phenotype the influence of stressors on gut microbiome and metabolites in obesity. Aim C: We will apply advanced analytical techniques in order to determine ethnic differences in the influence of stressors on the BGM axis in obesity.  The results of this study will provide novel information about a possible pathway whereby social stressors affect behavioral, neurological and microbiome mechanisms related to obesity risk. It will also provide new information in BGM patterns in two understudied ethnic groups. In the long term, this research may suggest possible approaches for intervention that may help reduce inequalities in obesity and related health problems. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH This study will provide new information about how social stressors contribute to obesity among Mexican and Filipino American women. Specifically, it tests the hypothesis that stressors lead to eating behaviors and dietary changes and that alter the brain-gut-microbiome axis. A better understanding of the role of how stress “gets under the skin” to contribute to alterations in the brain and gut microbial metabolites in obesity, could lead to novel therapeutic strategies tailored to treat altered ingestive behaviors and obesity.",Social Isolation and Discrimination as Stressors Influencing Brain-Gut Microbiome Alterations among Filipino and Mexican

"Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition and atherosclerosis Project Summary/Abstract This competitive renewal is based on work demonstrating that a subpopulation of endothelial cells (ECs) in atherosclerotic plaques undergo a transition to a mesenchymal cell fate that involves loss of barrier function, expression of inflammatory genes and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. This transition is initiated by inflammatory signaling that sensitizes cells to TGFβ, which then drives the mesenchymal fate transition. A key consequence of the mesenchymal phenotype is production of a fibronectin-rich extracellular matrix that amplifies inflammatory signaling, recruiting leukocytes and production of cytokines. This sequence of events thus creates positive feedback, a key feature of disease progression and resistance to therapy. Our work during the past grant cycle has provided evidence that fate switching is driven by a minor subset of pre-existing, susceptible ECs that drive vessel wall remodeling. Our work has also elucidated novel pathways by which matrix remodeling alters integrin signaling to enhance inflammatory pathways and promotes disease progression. The overall goal of the current application is to understand the EC subpopulations and factors that drive fate switching, and the positive feedback mechanisms that drive disease. Aim 1 will elucidate endothelial heterogeneity in mice and in patients with atherosclerosis. Aim 2 will characterize disease-prone subset of normal endothelial cells. Aim 3 will elucidate the role of pro-inflammatory integrin signaling in evolution of EC populations in the atherosclerotic plaque and the downstream pathways that mediate plaque progression. Project Narrative Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory/metabolic disease in which cells of the artery wall remodel to form a plaque that can narrow vessel lumens or rupture and block blood flow. This grant aims to understand the changes in endothelial cell fate that govern vessel remodeling and the pathways by which these changes promote disease.

"The Nomenclature of Human and Vertebrate Genes PROJECT SUMMARY - HGNC The core objective of the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) is to enable effective communication and data exchange between everyone with an interest in human genes, by providing a unique, concise and standardized gene symbol and name for every human gene. As usage of genomic data increases in healthcare the need for a consistent language for genes becomes ever more vital. Aim 1 of this proposal will ensure the continuity of standardized naming of novel human protein-coding genes, long and small non-protein-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes, and pseudogenes. In particular all putative novel protein coding loci will require careful consideration; as active members of the Consensus Coding Sequence (CCDS) consortium, HGNC can ensure that named loci accurately reflect the current expert manual annotations provided by consortium members. Aim 2 concentrates on renaming newly characterized human genes that are currently assigned a placeholder symbol; some genes with a phenotype-based nomenclature will also be considered for reassignment. These updates will reflect functional information, aid name transferal to orthologous genes, and avoid confusion. This round of revision will be a precursor to a nomenclature freeze for the majority of protein coding genes. Aim 3 focusses on coordinating gene naming across vertebrates, collaborating with the six existing vertebrate gene nomenclature committees (mouse, rat, chicken, Anolis, Xenopus, zebrafish) which base their naming on human gene nomenclature. As the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) this effort will be extended to naming genes in vertebrates lacking a nomenclature authority, such as cow, dog and horse. Recent gene naming in chimpanzee enabled creation of the necessary tools, pipelines and databases required for naming in other species. Assignments will reflect homologous relationships to human genes. Aim 4 will investigate the utility of machine learning in automated assignment of systematic nomenclature to long ncRNA genes and vertebrate orthologs, and potentially to pseudogenes. Models will be trained on manually curated datasets to learn both explicit and implicit practices, and then applied at scale. Aim 5 will ensure consistent naming across vertebrates in complex and divergent gene families, which can reveal some of the most interesting evolutionary biology and account for key diversity between species, but require careful manual curation. HGNC will collaborate with experts to expand the successful gene naming in the pharmacologically relevant cytochrome P450 (CYP) family to further species, also working across species on two other complex key families involved in detoxification, the glutathione S-transferases (GST) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs). HGNC will also work with experts to expand gene naming of olfactory receptors, the largest vertebrate gene family, from mammals to other well- studied model organisms such as zebrafish, Xenopus and chicken. HGNC is the only group worldwide providing systematic and user-friendly names for genes that are used throughout biomedical science and clinical practice; this is a crucial facility, with increasing importance and direct benefits for public health. To ensure effective communication between basic and clinical researchers, practicing clinicians and patients, there has to be a consistent well managed set of names for all human genes, which HGNC has provided since 1979. Having these names enables new discoveries, avoids confusion and prevents patient harm, by helping to ensure that everyone refers to a given gene using the same name.",The Nomenclature of Human and Vertebrate Genes,10167757,U24HG003345,"['Biology ', ' Cattle ', ' Bovine Species ', ' bovid ', ' bovine ', ' cow ', ' Chickens ', ' Gallus domesticus ', ' Gallus gallus ', ' Gallus gallus domesticus ', ' Communication ', ' Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Cytochrome P450 ', ' Cytochrome P-450 ', ' Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System ', ' Cytochrome P450 Family Gene ', ' P450 ', ' Canis familiaris ', ' Canine Species ', ' Dogs ', ' Dogs Mammals ', ' canine ', ' domestic dog ', ' Family ', ' Freezing ', ' Future ', ' Gene Duplication ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Glutathione S-Transferase ', ' EC 2.5.1.18 ', ' Glutathione Organic Nitrate Ester Reductase ', ' Glutathione S-Alkyltransferase ', ' Glutathione S-Aralkyltransferase ', ' Glutathione S-Aryltransferase ', ' Glutathione S-Epoxidetransferase ', ' Glutathione Transferase ', ' Heme Transfer Protein ', ' Ligandins ', ' S-Hydroxyalkyl Glutathione Lyase ', ' glutathione aralkyltransferase ', ' glutathione aryltransferase ', ' Goals ', ' Equus caballus ', ' Domestic Horse ', ' Equine ', ' Equine Species ', ' Equus przewalskii ', ' Horses ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Manuals ', ' Drug Metabolic Detoxication ', ' Drug Metabolic Detoxification ', ' Metabolic Drug Detoxications ', ' Metabolism of Toxic Agents ', ' detoxification ', ' Study models ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Names ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Proteins ', ' Pseudogenes ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Rattus ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rat ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Science ', ' Standardization ', ' Glucuronosyltransferase ', ' Glucuronic Transferase ', ' Glucuronyltransferase ', ' UDP Glucuronosyltransferase ', ' UDP Glucuronyl Transferase ', ' Vertebrates ', ' Vertebrate Animals ', ' vertebrata ', ' Work ', ' Xenopus ', ' Xenopus sp.

"Aortic Valve Disease: Mechanisms and Therapeutic Approaches Aortic valve stenosis is the major cause of valve disease in the Western world, and the third leading cause of adult heart disease. It is a progressive disorder that worsens with age. Thickening of the aortic valve is followed by calcification that results in further stenosis that ultimately necessitates surgical replacement. A major risk factor for calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), which is present in 1–2% of the population, and involves formation of a two- rather than three-valve leaflet. ~35% of individuals with BAV will develop CAVD with age, but some with BAV have thickening even in childhood, requiring intervention. There are no medical treatments available for CAVD patients, and the only clinical option is surgical valve replacement. We reported that heterozygous nonsense mutations in the NOTCH1 (N1) transcription factor cause congenital biscuspid aortic valve (BAV) and severe CAVD and evidence suggests N1 is haploinsufficient in valve endothelial cells (ECs). Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived ECs from several patients with CAVD and N1 haploinsufficiency showed increased expression of pro-osteogenic and inflammatory signaling. Network analysis revealed key nodes that were responsible for much of the gene dysregulation. A chemical screen for the ability to restore expression of 120 dysregulated genes by targeted RNA-sequencing revealed several drugs that restored the network close to the N1+/+ state in human iPSC-ECs, with one, XCT790, showing efficacy in vivo for aortic valve thickening, calcification and stenosis in a mouse model. XCT790 is annotated to function as an inhibitor of estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRα). We now propose to test the hypotheses that XCT790 prevents aortic valve disease by inhibiting ERRα activity, can treat established disease, and can function in a subset of CAVD patient cells without N1 mutations. The aims are 1) to determine the mechanism of action by which XCT790 corrects disease-associated gene expression and prevents aortic valve disease; 2) to determine if XCT790 can treat established CAVD or prevent neonatal valve stenosis; and 3) to determine if gene dysregulation in primary aortic valve endothelial cells from sporadic CAVD patients with or without genetic variants in NOTCH1 pathway genes is responsive to XCT790. These studies will advance a potential therapeutic to treat a disease that represents an enormous unmet medical need, is characterized by high mortality and morbidity, and for which the only current remedy is a highly invasive surgery. Aortic valve disease is the third most common form of heart disease and one of the most difficult to treat pediatric diseases. In adults, calcification and thickening lead to need for surgical replacement, with no medical therapy available. In this proposal we test the mechanism by which a novel small molecule therapeutic prevents aortic valve calcification in mice, test the clinical scenarios in which it may be efficacious and determine the range of patients who may benefit from this therapy by examining the response of cells derived from individuals with valve disease.",Aortic Valve Disease: Mechanisms and Therapeutic Approaches,10103847,R01HL150100,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' aortic valve ', ' Aortic Valve Stenosis ', ' Aortic Stenosis ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Economics ', ' Estrogen Antagonists ', ' Anti-Estrogens ', ' antiestrogen ', ' antiestrogenic ', ' estrogen inhibitor ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Ligands ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Patients ', ' Pulmonary Valve Stenosis ', ' Pulmonary Stenosis ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Family suidae ', ' Pigs ', ' Suidae ', ' Swine ', ' porcine ', ' suid ', ' Testing ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' United States ', ' Surgical Valves ', ' notch protein ', ' notch ', ' notch receptors ', ' telomere ', ' calcification ', ' Calcified ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Chemicals ', ' Endothelial Cells ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Inflammatory ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Western World ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' ERRalpha ', ' estrogen-related receptor 1 ', ' estrogen-related receptor alpha ', ' ERR1 protein ', ' cell type ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' non-sense mutation ', ' Nonsense Mutation ', ' mutant ', ' chemical library ', ' small molecule libraries ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' Gene Expression Monitoring ', ' Gene Expression Pattern Analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analyses ', ' Transcript Expression Analysis ', ' gene expression analysis ', ' gene expression assay ', ' transcriptional profiling ', ' Gene Expression Profiling ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' telomerase RNA ', ' Telomerase RNA Component ', ' shear stress ', ' Aortic valvular disorders ', ' aortic valve defect ', ' aortic valve disease ', ' aortic valvular disease ', ' aortic valve disorder ', ' Pathologic Constriction ', ' Pathological Constriction ', ' Stenosis ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Drosophila Homolog of NOTCH 1 ', ' NOTCH1 ', ' TAN1 ', ' Translocation-Associated NOTCH Homolog ', ' NOTCH1 gene ', ' valve replacement ', ' Telomere Shortening ', ' in vivo ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' knock-down ', ' knockdown ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' Neonatal ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' malformation ', ' gene correction ', ' gene-corrected ', ' drug testing ', ' drug detection ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' therapeutic target ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' iPS ', ' iPSC ', ' iPSCs ', ' aging population ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' osteogenic ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' exome sequencing ', ' exome-seq ', ' bicuspid aortic valve ', ' small molecule therapeutics ', ' therapeutic candidate ', ' Drug Screening ', ' endothelial stem cell ', ' endothelial progenitor cell ', ' ']",NHLBI,J.

"THE CANCER EPITOPE DATABASE AND ANALYSIS RESOURCE ABSTRACT Recent years have witnessed a dramatic rise in interest towards cancer epitopes in general, and neoepitopes that encompass mutations arising in a given tumor in particular. Current lines of research examine how the epitope load in a given tumor relates to the success of checkpoint blockade treatments, and how to utilize epitope-based vaccines and adoptive transfer of epitope-specific T cells for personalized therapies. For these purposes, neoepitopes that are recurrently recognized in different individuals are of particular interest, which has also re-ignited interest in epitopes identified in classic tumor-associated antigens. Along with the interest in cancer epitopes, there is also interest in the TCRs and BCRs specifically recognizing them, as these have the potential to be used in therapeutic approaches, and they can aid in basic studies to infer the specificity of T cells or B cells characterized in single cell sequencing data. This resurgence of interest in epitopes has created a need to catalog and make accessible to the scientific community all epitope data, also linked to the biological, immunological, and clinical contexts. The ultimate goal is to come “full circle” and link epitope recognition and immunological readouts to clinical outcomes and treatment strategies alike. In parallel, there is an urgent need to develop resources for epitope prediction and analysis tools that provide access to predictive strategies and provide objective evaluations of their performance in the relevant biological, immunological, and clinical contexts. Recent years have also witnessed the publication of multiple original methodologies that reported sometimes impressive gains in the predictions of cancer epitopes. However, several of these studies were difficult to evaluate, because the methodologies and/or datasets were not fully available in a format that was readily executable. As a result, their performance could not be properly benchmarked on independent datasets. This is also because effective benchmarking on independent datasets requires the assembly of novel datasets of sufficient size and diversity. To overcome all of these information technology challenges, we propose to design and implement the Cancer Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (CEDAR), which will provide a freely accessible, comprehensive collection of cancer epitope and receptor data curated from the literature, and provide easily accessible epitope and TCR/BCR target prediction and analysis tools. As the cancer epitope data are curated, they will be used as a transparent benchmark of how well prediction tools perform, and also to develop new prediction tools for the analysis resource component of CEDAR. CEDAR will leverage our expertise from developing the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB), which is fully operational and widely used by researchers globally. CEDAR will directly complement other projects currently funded through the NIH ITCR program that provide resources and tools related to cancer omics data. Finally, we will engage in outreach activities to improve functions, user interfaces, and interoperability with other ITCR tools and promote the use of CEDAR in cancer research. NARRATIVE Progress in the use of epitopes for cancer immunology and immunotherapy is hampered by a disconnect in information technology, which segregates investigators from the data and tools needed to appropriately conduct their research. Development of a Cancer Epitope Database and Analysis Resource will overcome this issue by harmonizing and centralizing the capture of cancer epitope data, and by using these data to establish and evaluate epitope analysis and prediction tools that will be made freely available to the research community.",THE CANCER EPITOPE DATABASE AND ANALYSIS RESOURCE,10187436,U24CA248138,"['thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Technology ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Tumor Antigens ', ' Tumor-Associated Antigen ', ' cancer antigens ', ' tumor-specific antigen ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Immunology ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Intuition ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Funding ', ' cancer immunotherapy ', ' anti-cancer immunotherapy ', ' anticancer immunotherapy ', ' immune-based cancer therapies ', ' immunotherapy for cancer ', ' immunotherapy of cancer ', ' T-Lymphocyte Epitopes ', ' T-Cell Epitopes ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adoptive Transfer ', ' catalog ', ' Catalogs ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Tumor Tissue ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' success ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' Informatics ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' outreach ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' outreach program ', ' Property ', ' cancer immunology ', ' neoplasm immunology ', ' tumor immunology ', ' T Cell Specificity ', ' T-Cell Immunologic Specificity ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' NIAID ', ' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease ', ' Receptor Cell ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' Cancer Histology ', ' Collection ', ' Ontology ', ' Validation ', ' Immunologics ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologically ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' disease phenotype ', ' anticancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' Information Technology ', ' immunogenicity ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' improved functioning ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' prospective ', ' interoperability ', ' web-accessible ', ' prototype ', ' tumor ', ' treatment strategy ', ' database structure ', ' data base structure ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' single cell sequencing ', ' translational cancer research ', ' immune checkpoint blockade ', ' check point blockade ', ' checkpoint blockade ', ' immune check point blockade ', ' neoantigens ', ' neo-antigen ', ' neo-epitopes ', ' neoepitopes ', ' Infrastructure ', ' data tools ', ' Antibodies ', ' Epitopes ', ' Antigenic Determinants ', ' Binding Determinants ', ' Attention ', ' Autoimmunity ', ' Autoimmune Status ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' B blood cells ', ' B cell ', ' B cells ', ' B-Cells ', ' B-cell ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Engineering ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Allergy ', ' Immunotherapy ', ' Immune mediated therapy ', ' Immunologically Directed Therapy ', ' immune therapeutic approach ', ' immune therapeutic interventions ', ' immune therapeutic regimens ', ' immune therapeutic strategy ', ' immune therapy ', ' immune-based therapies ', ' immune-based treatments ', ' immuno therapy ', ' Literature ', ' Methodology ', ' Study models ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' B-Cell Antigen Receptor ', ' B cell receptor ', ' T-Cell Receptor ', ' MHC Receptor ', ' Major Histocompatibility Complex Receptor ', ' Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Specificity ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' T-Cells ', ' ']",NCI,LA JOLLA INSTITUTE FOR IMMUNOLOGY,U24,2021,839852,CA-52
"Neural and Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Stress-Induced Inflammatory Responses PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the number one killer of Americans, and also causes significant economic costs to the nation. Thus, understanding the mechanisms through which CVD develops is of paramount importance if we are to successfully identify those at risk for CVD, and intervene to ultimately prevent CVD-related death and economic impact. Psychological stress reactivity has long been appreciated as a risk factor for negative CVD- related outcomes, and recent work suggests that inflammatory reactivity to stress is a critical biological mechanism through which stress increases risk for CVD. However, there are significant gaps in our current knowledge regarding the neural predictors and molecular pathways through which stress leads to inflammation. These knowledge gaps are critical to fill if we are to develop a full mechanistic understanding of how stress leads to CVD risk, and may also shed light on future intervention targets. Thus, the present project will use cutting- edge computational methods to identify neural signatures of stress-related inflammatory reactivity, and will use pharmacological tools to block an important stress-signaling pathway (i.e., beta-adrenergic signaling) and examine its effects on neural and inflammatory reactivity to stress. Study 1 (N=100) will use fMRI to examine neural responses to a social evaluative stress task, with blood samples taken before and after the stressor assayed for pro-inflammatory gene expression and circulating inflammatory proteins. We will use innovative multivariate machine learning analytic techniques to identify the neural patterns that predict changes in inflammation, as well as network-based analytic tools from mathematics to examine how large-scale brain networks change configuration in response to stress in ways that are linked to inflammation. In Study 2 (N=120), we will conduct a mechanistic, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the beta-adrenergic receptor blocker propranolol to examine how blocking beta-adrenergic signaling impacts neural and inflammatory responses to the social evaluative stress task. Together, these two studies will allow us to establish the neural signatures of stress-induced increases in inflammation (Aim 1), determine the effects of beta-adrenergic signaling on neural responses to stress (Aim 2), and examine the neural mediators of beta-adrenergic related attenuations in stress-related inflammatory reactivity (Aim 3). In doing so, this project will ultimately help identify neural signatures of risk for stress-related inflammation, as well as novel targets for future intervention to ameliorate the impact of stress on the brain and body and reduce the health and economic burden of CVD. PROJECT NARRATIVE What are the neural and molecular mechanisms through which psychological stress leads to an inflammatory response, thus increasing risk for cardiovascular disease? The present project will use neuroimaging and pharmacological tools to answer this question, exploring the neural activity patterns and brain network configuration in response to stress that is associated with increases in inflammation, as well as how experimentally blocking one important stress signaling pathway (i.e., beta-adrenergic signaling) shapes neural and inflammatory responses to stress. Ultimately, these studies will fill critical gaps in our knowledge regarding the mechanisms through which stress may lead to cardiovascular disease risk, and help to identify novel targets for future interventions.",Neural and Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Stress-Induced Inflammatory Responses,10185562,R01HL157422,"['Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Procedures ', ' Anterior ', ' Medial ', ' Acute ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Shapes ', ' Inflammatory ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' American ', ' stressor ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' attenuation ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' economic cost ', ' economic impact ', ' Graph ', ' social ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' Brain region ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Molecular ', ' Cardiac ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' preclinical study ', ' pre-clinical study ', ' social genomics ', ' socio-genomics ', ' sociogenomics ', ' double-blind placebo controlled trial ', ' double-masked controlled trial ', ' health economics ', ' Outcome ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' analytical tool ', ' Affective ', ' Network-based ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' inflammation marker ', ' neural patterning ', ' stress reactivity ', ' Adrenergic Agents ', ' Adrenergic Drugs ', ' Adrenergics ', ' Adrenergic beta-Antagonists ', ' Adrenergic beta-Blockers ', ' beta blocker ', ' beta-Adrenergic Blocking Agents ', ' beta-Adrenergic Receptor Blockaders ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Double-Blind Method ', ' Double-Blind Study ', ' Double-Blinded ', ' Double-Masked Method ', ' Double-Masked Study ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Inflammation ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BSF2 ', ' HPGF ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IL-6 ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Maps ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Pathology ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Placebos ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' sham therapy ', ' Play ', ' Propranolol ', ' Propanolol ', ' Proteins ', ' Psychoneuroimmunology ', ' psychoneuroimmunological ', ' beta-adrenergic receptor ', ' β-adrenergic receptor ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Up-Regulation ', ' Upregulation ', ' Work ', ' cytokine ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' computational neuroscience ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,621869,NC-04
"Investigating the prognostic role of intrinsic immune evasion mechanisms in HNSCC ABSTRACT Head and neck cancer is one of the most prevalent aggressive cancers worldwide, with the majority being squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), or HNSCC. The well-known risk factors associated with the genesis of HNSCC include human papillomavirus and environment factors including tobacco and alcohol use. Despite more than two decades of research into the molecular genetics of HNSCC, there is still lack of prognostic biomarkers that can guide current treatment and management of HNSCC patients. Previous studies and our preliminary analysis showed that top immune-centric biomarkers had the most promising prognostic value for HNSCC patients compared to other immunotherapy-favorable cancers such as skin and lung cancers. In this R01 project, we propose a large-scale secondary analysis of existing transcriptomic and genetic data to elucidate the prognostic role of intrinsic immune evasion mechanisms in head and neck cancer. The underlying central hypothesis is that tumor-intrinsic and host-intrinsic immune signaling co-modulate the effectiveness of existing therapies in HNSCC; and elucidation of the interaction between targeted genomic/genetic alternations and background tumor-immune signatures via efficient statistical and machine learning methods can lead to novel prognostic biomarkers, as well as potential therapeutic targets. To this end, we propose three specifics aims. In the first aim, we will generate HNSCC-specific immune signatures by integrating single-cell and bulk-tumor transcriptomic data using novel machine learning methods developed by our team. In the second aim, we will discover and prioritize immune-related long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) biomarkers by recalling existing transcriptome data and applying an efficient genome-wide screening method. In the third aim, we will combine baseline germline variants with tumor immune signatures and further examine its prognostic value in patients treated by immune checkpoint blockade (provide by multiple institutes including Moffitt, OSU and UNC). Collectively, we propose the most extensive study to date in HNSCC investigating under-investigated element of the genomics source for predicting clinical and tumor immune phenotypes. The new omics data resource and resulted biomarkers, especially the immune-related biomarkers, from our research have potential to impact upon the diagnosis and prognosis of HNSCC patients and could guide more efficient and personalized immunotherapy selection in the future. NARRATIVE There is a pressing and unmet need to identify prognostic biomarkers in head and neck cancer. By repurposing existing genomic data available in public databases and at Moffitt, we propose the first large-scale study investigating the potential of immune mechanistic signatures and their mediators as biomarkers in predicting patient survival outcomes in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Such knowledge may lead to improved identification of patient subgroups for development of novel and targeted therapies in HNSCC.",Investigating the prognostic role of intrinsic immune evasion

"Development of Technologies for Efficient In Vivo Prime Editing PROJECT SUMMARY  Genome editing is revolutionizing biomedicine and biotechnology by enabling the precise modification of genomic DNA in living cells. While various genome-editing tools have been developed over the past decade, the CRISPR-Cas9 system has emerged as a particularly versatile and efficient technology for editing DNA. Nonetheless, limitations derived from its reliance on DNA double strand breaks (DSB), which can lead to unpredictable editing outcomes and even chromosomal translocations, could limit its applications.  Base editors (BEs) and prime editors (PEs) are two novel classes of genome-editing tools capable of introducing precise single-base conversion in DNA without the requirement of a DSB. PEs, in particular, provide greater flexibility than BEs, owing to their ability to introduce any type of base conversion and even programable small insertions and deletions. This expanded set of capabilities compared to other technologies makes PEs a particularly promising platform for applications in biomedicine; however, the large size of PEs precludes their in vivo delivery by AAV, a promising and effective gene delivery vehicle that is currently under evaluation in multiple clinical trials.  To overcome these obstacles, we have created a split-PE platform that is compatible with AAV delivery and have demonstrated the functionality of this approach in cultured cells. Despite this progress, there still remain several critical challenges, which we here propose to overcome in order to optimize this technology for effective and specific in vivo prime editing.  To accomplish this objective, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team with collective expertise in genome editing (Dr. Perez-Pinera), AAV gene delivery (Dr. Gaj) and computational biology (Dr. Song). Our collaborative efforts will yield an integrated and comprehensive PE toolset that will blend strategies for target identification and editing optimization, with methods for reducing off-target effects and immune responses, thus priming this technology for future in vivo applications.  Given that the flexibility of PEs has significantly expanded the number of actionable target sites that can be genetically modified, we anticipate that the integrated technologies we develop will have large, direct and long- lasting impact in biomedicine by enabling not only novel gene therapies, but also basic research. In particular, our technology will provide investigators with biological tools that are uniquely capable of introducing mutations within post-mitotic cells in vivo, which could be used to dissect functional elements or even determine the role of pathogenic mutations in a cell- and tissue-specific manner. The technologies created by this application will thus broadly impact biotechnology and biomedicine. NARRATIVE Genome editing technologies provide novel opportunities to advance basic research and treat human diseases but approaches that use active nucleases to edit DNA can induce undesired and deleterious effects in the genome, which can reduce their therapeutic potential. Prime editors are a recently emerged gene-editing variant capable of introducing precise modifications to DNA, with minimal damage to the genome. This proposal is focused on creating an integrative prime editing toolkit that will provide investigators with technologies that will enable their use in vivo, improve their specificity and streamline their design and implementation, thereby advancing the applications of this methodology in biotechnology and biomedicine.",Development of Technologies for Efficient In Vivo Prime Editing,10184207,R01GM141296,"['Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ', ' Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Motor Neuron Disease ', "" Gehrig's Disease "", ' Lou Gehrig Disease ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' Carrying Capacities ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cultured Cells ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Elements ', ' Engineering ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Future ', ' gene therapy ', ' DNA Therapy ', ' Gene Transfer Clinical ', ' Genetic Intervention ', ' gene-based therapy ', ' genetic therapy ', ' genomic therapy ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Poly A ', ' Poly(rA) ', ' polyadenylate ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Peptide Signal Sequences ', ' Signal Peptide ', ' Signal Sequences ', ' protein signal sequence ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Chromosomal translocation ', ' Chromosomal dislocation ', ' Genetic Translocation ', ' chromosome dislocation ', ' chromosome translocation ', ' Site-Directed Mutagenesis ', ' Site-Specific Mutagenesis ', ' Targeted DNA Modification ', ' Targeted Modification ', ' Open Reading Frames ', ' ORFs ', ' Protein Coding Region ', ' Mediating ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs ', ' G(s), alpha Subunit ', ' G(s), α Subunit ', ' G(s)alpha ', ' G(s)α ', ' GTP-Binding Protein α Subunits, Gs ', ' Gs alpha Family G-Protein ', ' Gsα ', ' Gαs ', ' Regulatory Ns Protein ', ' Stimulatory Gs G-Protein ', ' alpha Subunit Stimulatory GTP-Binding Protein ', ' alpha-Gs ', ' α-Gs ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Evaluation ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' computer biology ', ' Computational Biology ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' non-sense mutation ', ' Nonsense Mutation ', ' experience ', ' nuclease ', ' particle ', ' success ', ' tech development ', ' technology development ', ' Trans RNA Splicing ', ' Trans-Splicing ', ' novel ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' response ', ' immunogenic ', ' miniaturize ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Intervening Protein Sequence ', ' Protein Introns ', ' intein ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' DNA Double Strand Break ', ' Data ', ' Mitotic ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' in vivo ', ' Modification ', ' Gene Delivery ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' insertion/deletion mutation ', ' indel ', ' insertion-deletion ', ' insertion-deletion mutation ', ' insertion/deletion ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' adeno-associated viral vector ', ' AAV vector ', ' adeno-associated virus vector ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' human disease ', ' reconstitution ', ' reconstitute ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Genomic DNA ', ' gDNA ', ' biophysical techniques ', ' biophysical approaches ', ' biophysical methodology ', ' biophysical methods ', ' Genomic approach ', ' genomic effort ', ' genomic strategy ', ' genome editing ', ' genomic editing ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' CRISPR method ', ' CRISPR methodology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR-based method ', ' CRISPR-based technique ', ' CRISPR-based technology ', ' CRISPR-based tool ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 technology ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats method ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats methodology ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats technique ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats technology ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' technology research and development ', ' technological research and development ', ' computational suite ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2021,535871,IL-13
"Knowledge-Based Biomedical Data Science Knowledge-based biomedical data science  In the previous funding period, we designed and constructed breakthrough methods for creating a semantically coherent and logically consistent knowledge-base by automatically transforming and integrating many biomedical databases, and by directly extracting information from the literature. Building on decades of work in biomedical ontology development, and exploiting the architectures supporting the Semantic Web, we have demonstrated methods that allow effective querying spanning any combination of data sources in purely biological terms, without the queries having to reflect anything about the structure or distribution of information among any of the sources. These methods are also capable of representing apparently conflicting information in a logically consistent manner, and tracking the provenance of all assertions in the knowledge-base. Perhaps the most important feature of these methods is that they scale to potentially include nearly all knowledge of molecular biology.  We now hypothesize that using these technologies we can build knowledge-bases with broad enough coverage to overcome the “brittleness” problems that stymied previous approaches to symbolic artificial intelligence, and then create novel computational methods which leverage that knowledge to provide critical new tools for the interpretation and analysis of biomedical data. To test this hypothesis, we propose to address the following specific aims:  1. Identify representative and significant analytical needs in knowledge-based data science, and  refine and extend our knowledge-base to address those needs in three distinct domains: clinical  pharmacology, cardiovascular disease and rare genetic disease.  2. Develop novel and implement existing symbolic, statistical, network-based, machine learning  and hybrid approaches to goal-driven inference from very large knowledge-bases. Create a goal-  directed framework for selecting and combining these inference methods to address particular  analytical problems.  3. Overcome barriers to broad external adoption of developed methods by analyzing their  computational complexity, optimizing performance of knowledge-based querying and inference,  developing simplified, biology-focused query languages, lightweight packaging of knowledge  resources and systems, and addressing issues of licensing and data redistribution.

"Computational Methods for Next-Generation Comparative Genomics PROJECT SUMMARY Recent advances in regulatory genomics, especially 3D genome organization in cell nucleus, suggest that existing methods for cross-species comparisons are limited in their ability to fully understand the evolution of non-coding genome function. In particular, it is known that genomes are compartmentalized to distinct compartments in the nucleus such as nuclear lamina and nuclear speckles. Such nuclear compartmentalization is an essential feature of higher-order genome organization and is linked to various important genome functions such as DNA replication timing and transcription. Unfortunately, to date no study exists that directly compares nuclear compartmentalization between human and other mammals. In addition, there are no computational models available that consider the continuous nature of multiple features of nuclear compartmentalization and function, which is critical to integrate genome-wide functional genomic data and datasets that measure cytological distance to multiple compartments across species. In this project, we will develop novel algorithms and generate new datasets to directly address two key questions: (1) How to identify the evolutionary patterns of nuclear compartmentalization? (2) What types of sequence evolution may drive spatial localization changes across species? The proposed project represents the first endeavor in comparative genomics for nuclear compartmentalization. Our Specific Aims are: (1) Developing new probabilistic models for identifying evolutionary patterns of nuclear compartmentalization. (2) Identifying genome-wide evolutionary patterns of nuclear compartmentalization in primate species based on TSA-seq and Repli-seq. (3) Developing new algorithms to connect sequence features to nuclear compartmentalization through cross-species comparisons. Successful completion of these aims will result in novel computational tools and new datasets that will be highly valuable for the comparative genomics community. Integrating the new computational tools and unique datasets will provide invaluable insights into the relationship between sequence evolution and changes in nuclear genome organization in mammalian species. Therefore, the proposed research is expected to advance comparative genomics to a new frontier and provide new perspectives for studying human genome function PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because the outcome of the project is expected to enhance the analyses of nuclear genome organizations across primate species to better understand genome function and human biology.

"Blending deep learning with probabilistic mechanistic models to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors Project Summary Scientific understanding of adaptive immune receptors (i.e. antibodies and T cell receptors) has the potential to revolutionize prophylaxis, diagnosis, and treatment of disease. High‐throughput DNA sequencing and functional experiments have now brought the study of adaptive immune receptors into the big‐data era. To realize this potential of these data they must be matched with appropriately powerful analytical techniques. Existing probabilistic and mechanistic models are insufficient to capture the complexities of these data, while a naïve application of machine learning cannot leverage our profound existing knowledge of the immune system. The goal of this project is to blend deep learning with mechanistic modeling in order to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors. Aim 1: Develop generative models of immune receptor sequences that capture the complexity of real adaptive immune receptor repertoires. These will combine deep learning along with our knowledge of VDJ recombination, and provide a rigorous platform for detailed repertoire comparison. Aim 2: Develop quantitative mechanistic models of antibody somatic hypermutation that incorporate the underlying biochemical processes. Estimate intractable likelihoods using deep learning to infer important latent variables, and validate models using knock‐out experiments in cell lines. Aim 3: Develop hybrid deep learning models to predict binding properties from sequence data, combining large experimentally‐derived binding data with even larger sets of immune sequences from human immune memory samples. Incorporate structural information via 3D convolution or distance‐based penalties. These tools will reveal the full power of immune repertoire data for medical applications. We will obtain more rigorous comparisons of repertoires via their distribution in a relevant space. These will reveal the effects of immune perturbations such as vaccination and disease, allowing us to pick out sequences that are impacted by these perturbations. We will have a greater quantitative understanding of somatic hypermutation in vivo, and statistical models that appropriately capture long‐range effects of collections of mutations. We will also have algorithms that will be able to combine repertoire data and sparse binding data to predict binding properties. Put together, these advances will enable rational vaccine design, treatment for autoimmune disease, and identification of T cells that are promising candidates for cancer immunotherapy. Project Narrative Adaptive immune receptors (i.e. antibodies and T cell receptors) enable our body to fight off disease, “remember” pathogens, and train the immune system through vaccination. Immunologists have learned via high‐throughput sequencing that adaptive immune receptors have a truly remarkable diversity. In this proposal, we develop machine‐learning methods for these sequence data, which will allow us to predict the maturation, statistical distribution, and binding properties of adaptive immune receptors, and thus to better design vaccinations, autoimmune disease treatment, and immunotherapy treatment for cancer.",Blending deep learning with probabilistic mechanistic models to predict and

"Identifying Healthy and High-Risk Weight Loss Phenotypes to Optimize Obesity Management in End Stage Kidney Disease Project Summary/Abstract  In 2016, 47,000 individuals who initiated dialysis in the United States (~42% of all incident dialysis patients that year) had obesity, with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 30 kilograms per meters squared. Across the BMI spectrum, individuals with kidney disease commonly lose weight after initiating dialysis treatment. However, whereas body weight typically stabilizes after the first several months of dialysis among patients without obesity, those with obesity often continue to lose weight. Both people with and without obesity who are on dialysis may lose weight due to muscle wasting and malnutrition, and recent studies have identified weight loss as a risk factor for death among people on dialysis, independent of BMI. Yet, some of the weight loss observed among obese dialysis patients may also reflect deliberate attempts to improve health, mobility, or access to kidney transplantation. Currently, there are no guidelines to help clinicians to differentiate between healthy and high-risk weight loss among people with obesity on dialysis. Further, typical obesity management paradigms are not easily transferrable to obese people with end-stage kidney disease, given factors such as chronic malnutrition, inflammation, and sarcopenia in this population that may modify the risks and benefits of different weight loss strategies. Therefore, the overarching goal of this five-year research proposal is to define healthy and high-risk weight loss phenotypes among people with obesity who are on dialysis, and to provide clinically feasible tools to improve obesity management in the setting of end-stage kidney disease. We will accomplish this goal by conducting three distinct but interrelated studies. In the first study, we will qualitatively determine patient-prioritized endpoints of weight loss, in addition to patient, physician and other stakeholder perspectives on the key factors that differentiate healthy from high-risk weight loss on dialysis. In the second study, we will leverage a national dataset of 23,000 obese dialysis patients and apply constructs of high and low physiologic reserve to derive healthy and high-risk weight loss phenotypes. We will then develop a weight- loss risk calculator tool that predicts the risks of hospitalization and death that are associated with each weight loss phenotype, using dynamic predictive joint models and machine learning techniques. In the third study, we will enroll 250 obese dialysis patients in a prospective, longitudinal study across five regions in the United States to evaluate the association between nutritional, inflammatory, and hemodynamic biomarkers and measures of health trajectory that are not typically captured in registry data, such as sarcopenia, dynapenia, body composition, and patient-prioritized endpoints such as quality of life. In accomplishing its aims, this research will provide urgently needed knowledge and tools that will improve the medical management of tens of thousands of people with end-stage kidney disease and obesity, ensuring that clinicians will be better able to incorporate patient-prioritized outcomes into assessments of weight loss interventions, and recognize and mitigate the effects of high-risk weight loss. Project Narrative Although over 40,000 obese individuals with end-stage kidney disease initiate dialysis each year in the United States, there are no guidelines on optimal obesity management in the setting of dialysis care. Obese dialysis patients may lose weight due to chronic illness or due to intentional weight loss attempts, though it is difficult to differentiate between healthy and unhealthy weight loss in these patients. This proposal seeks to advance the science of obesity management in dialysis settings by providing new tools to differentiate between healthy and unhealthy weight loss trajectories among obese dialysis patients.",Identifying Healthy and High-Risk Weight Loss Phenotypes to Optimize Obesity Management in End Stage Kidney Disease,10179372,R01DK124388,"['Blood Pressure ', ' Body Composition ', ' Body Weight ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Confidence Intervals ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Dialysis ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hemodialysis ', ' Hemodialyses ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Inflammation ', ' Interview ', ' Joints ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Renal Grafting ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' kidney tx ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' mortality ', ' Muscular Atrophy ', ' Muscle Atrophy ', ' muscle breakdown ', ' muscle degradation ', ' muscle deterioration ', ' muscle loss ', ' muscle wasting ', ' Nephrology ', ' nutrition ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' United States ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' body weight loss ', ' wt-loss ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Malnutrition ', ' Nutritional Deficiency ', ' Undernutrition ', ' dietary deficiency ', ' malnourished ', ' nutrition deficiency ', ' nutrition deficiency disorder ', ' nutritional deficiency disorder ', ' Guidelines ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Muscle function ', ' Individual ', ' muscle form ', ' muscle bulk ', ' muscle mass ', ' Patient-Centered Care ', ' Inflammatory ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' transplant patient ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dietitian ', ' Kilogram ', ' Techniques ', ' meter ', ' muscle strength ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' hazard ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' sarcopenic ', ' sarcopenia ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' BMI ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Nutritional ', ' nutritious ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' obesity management ', ' health related quality of life ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Dialysis patients ', ' Outcome ', ' Non obese ', ' Nonobese ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' weight loss intervention ', ' weight loss therapy ', ' weight loss treatment ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' morphogens ', ' differentiation factors ', ' morphogenic factors ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' inflammation marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' improved mobility ', ' mobility enhancement ', ' mobility improvement ', ' optimized mobility ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' data registry ', ' healthy weight ', ' clinical predictors ', ' reduced muscle strength ', ' decreased muscle strength ', ' dynapenia ', ' low muscle strength ', ' muscle strength decline ', ' predictive tools ', ' Prospective cohort study ', ' sleep quality ', ' quality of sleep ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' stakeholder perspectives ', ' stakeholder insights ', ' obese person ', ' obese individuals ', ' obese people ', ' obese population ', ' obese subjects ', ' obese patients ', ' patients with obesity ', ' ']",NIDDK,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,291877,PA-03
"Adapting machine learning methods to detect genetic loci specific to strictly defined MDD Abstract  This project seeks to further our understanding of the genetic influences on Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). One approach to increasing sample sizes for molecular genetic studies of MDD and thereby increasing power to detect genetic loci is to assess individuals using surveys that are shorter and more efficient than full clinical assessments. This `minimal phenotyping' leads to identification of risk loci that may not be specific to strictly defined MDD and can be associated with a variety of psychiatric phenotypes. While these discoveries are important to understand the overall biology of complex mental and psychiatric outcomes, they offer little direct and actionable insight into the biological underpinning of strictly defined MDD which shows increased severity, impairment, and recurrence risk and accounts for a disproportionate impact on disability and morbidity in comparison to liberally defined MDD. Recently, large biobanks surveying tens to hundreds of thousands of subjects across hundreds to thousands of variables and EHR records have been become available to the scientific community. Combining rich phenotype data with genome-wide genotyping or sequencing offers an unprecedented opportunity to leverage these resources to advance discovery and understanding of the genetic influences on MDD. One major challenge is the lack of uniform measures that allow assessment of strictly defined MDD, impairment, severity, and recurrence risk. This lack of `deep phenotyping' while pragmatic in allowing the assembly of large samples, creates challenges in accurate determinations of controls, non-specific mild cases, and strictly defined cases. We have previously shown how machine learning (ML) analysis methods can leverage this type of heterogeneous, broad, but light collection of information to predict and quantify risk in subjects not deeply assessed. While there is significant room for improvement in these predictions, the resulting effective sample size and power to detect specific liability loci increased dramatically when this method was applied. In Aim 1, we plan to evaluate 2 families of ML methods that can be used to predict unmeasured and specific strictly defined MDD risk. In Aim 2, we propose to use these predictions of risk in genetic association analyses to detect common genetic variation that influences risk specific to strictly defined MDD. Finally, we will make our biobank adapted ML method pipeline available to the broader psychiatric genetics research community which is expected to improve power and loci detection for other psychiatric disorders.   NARRATIVE  Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is common psychiatric disorder, a leading cause of disability worldwide, and partially influenced by genetics. Rigorous clinical assessments are generally needed for studies to distinguish between genetic loci influencing mild versus debilitating manifestations of the disorder. We propose to evaluate and adapt machine learning methods to estimate risk to strictly defined MDD in large-scale biobanks samples that measure many variables but may not contain rigorous clinical assessments and use these predictions to discover additional genetic variation specifically influencing MDD.",Adapting machine learning methods to detect genetic loci specific to strictly defined MDD,10196078,R21MH126358,"['Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Biology ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Genotype ', ' indexing ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Neurotic Disorders ', ' Neuroses ', ' Psychoneuroses ', ' neurotic ', ' neuroticism ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Probability ', ' Records ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' psychogenetics ', ' psychiatric genetics ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' improved ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Genetic Research ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' BMI ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' genetic association ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Collection ', ' lifetime risk ', ' life-time risk ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' vector ', ' genome wide association study ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Heritability ', ' Impairment ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' risk variant ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk allele ', ' risk gene ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk loci ', ' risk locus ', ' Genetic study ', ' phenotypic data ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' genomic locus ', ' gene locus ', ' genetic locus ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIMH,RESEARCH TRIANGLE INSTITUTE,R21,2021,208389,NC-04
"National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB) OVERALL - PROJECT SUMMARY The mission of the National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB) is to advance the science of biological networks by creating leading-edge bioinformatic methods, software tools and infrastructure, and by engaging the scientific community in a portfolio of collaboration and training opportunities. Much of biomedical research is dependent on knowledge of biological networks of multiple types and scales, including molecular interactions among genes, proteins, metabolites and drugs; cell communication systems; relationships among genotypes and biological and clinical phenotypes; and patient and social networks. NRNB-supported platforms like Cytoscape are among the most widely used software tools in biology, with tens of thousands of active users, enabling researchers to apply network concepts and data to understand biological systems and how they are reprogrammed in disease.  NRNB’s three Technology Research and Development projects introduce innovative concepts with the potential to transform network biology, transitioning it from a static to a dynamic science (TR&D 1); from flat network diagrams to multi-scale hierarchies of biological structure and function (TR&D 2); and from descriptive interaction maps to predictive and interpretable machine learning models (TR&D 3). In previous funding periods our technology projects have produced novel and highly cited approaches, including network-based biomarkers for stratification of disease, data-driven gene ontologies assembled completely from network data, and deep learning models of cell structure and function built using biological networks as a scaffold.  During the next period of support, we introduce dynamic regulatory networks formulated from single-cell transcriptomics and advanced proteomics data (TR&D 1); substantially improved methodology for the study of hierarchical structure and pleiotropy in biological networks (TR&D 2); and procedures for using networks to seed machine learning models of drug response that are both mechanistically interpretable and transferable across biomedical contexts (TR&D 3). These efforts are developed and applied in close collaboration with outside investigators from 19 Driving Biomedical Projects who specialize in experimental generation of network data, disease biology (cancer, neuropsychiatric disorders, diabetes), single-cell developmental biology, and clinical trials. TR&Ds are also bolstered by 7 Technology Partnerships in which NRNB scientists coordinate technology development with leading resource-development groups in gene function prediction, mathematics and algorithm development, and biomedical databases. Beyond these driving collaborations, we continually support a broader portfolio of transient (non-driving) research collaborations; organize and lead international meetings including the popular Network Biology track of the Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology conference; and deliver a rich set of training opportunities and network analysis protocols. OVERALL - PROJECT NARRATIVE We are all familiar with some of the components of biological systems – DNA, proteins, cells, organs, individuals – but understanding biological systems involves more than just cataloging its component parts. It is critical to understand the many interactions of these parts within systems, and how these systems give rise to biological functions and responses and determine states of health and disease.

"A novel microfluidic platform to study exosome biology in PAH. The endothelium is the cellular monolayer that covers the inner lining of the entire circulatory system. Endothelial dysfunction is a feature of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a life-threatening disease associated with abnormally high pulmonary pressures and chronic right heart failure. Due to the limitations of available static cell culture and animal models, our understanding of the mechanisms that orchestrate the initiation and perseverance of endothelial dysfunction in PAH remains incomplete. Given that endothelial dysfunction is a common finding in PAH, an understanding of the mechanism behind maladaptive endothelial responses could help accelerate the discovery of novel therapies for PAH. Presently, it is believed that endothelial derived exosomes contribute to PAH by carrying signals that trigger maladaptive endothelial responses in the setting of injury. Exosomes are cell-derived small (~30-150 nm) extracellular vesicles that carry proteins, metabolites and nucleic acids involved in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. While it is known that exosomes carry molecular and genetic factors associated with angiogenesis, inflammation and vasoreactivity, a comprehensive assessment of exosome cargo of healthy and dysfunctional PMVECs has been hindered by current low-yield exosome isolation techniques. These techniques cannot perform real-time dynamic exosome isolation from pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) exposed to PAH-associated stressors. To address this unmet need, we have designed the MFES (Multifunctional Exosome Sorter) that can dissect the whole exosome population into subpopulations based on size and surface markers. MFES is the first lab-on-a-chip platform that integrates: 1) a vessel-on-a-chip module for real-time characterization of PMVEC functional responses across a wide range of physiological and pathological parameters, 2) a module for high-yield exosome size-based isolation, 3) a surface marker based exosome sorting using magnetic beads, and 4) multi-omics phenotyping of exosomes of PMVECs. Here, we are proposing a technology that can enable broadly to investigate the two main defining characteristics of exosomal subtypes, i.e., size and surface markers, both separately independently, and in combination sequentially. We will characterize changes in exosome cargo in healthy and PAH PMVECs exposed to shear stress-related conditions in the MFES. We will isolate subpopulations of exosomes based on size and surface markers and characterize them for their cargo (Aim 1). Then, we will determine whether exosomes derived from stressed PMVECs can induce pathological changes in healthy PMVECs cultured in a microfluidic culture chip (Aim 2). This technological innovation enables to study endothelial exosome biology in a setting that represents the flow dynamics associated with PAH. Further, the use of cutting-edge -omics technologies, bioinformatic analysis integrated with machine learning algorithms to analyze the purified exosomes is expected to yield a comprehensive dataset of exosome cargo profiles and open exciting opportunities for investigating the biological role of exosomes in PAH pathobiology and the testing of novel therapeutic agents. Due to the limitations of available static cell culture and animal models, our understanding of the mechanisms that orchestrate the initiation and perseverance of endothelial dysfunction in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) remains incomplete. The endothelial cell derived exosomes, small (~30-150 nm) extracellular vesicles, contribute to PAH by carrying signals that trigger maladaptive endothelial responses in the setting of injury via molecular and genetic factors associated with angiogenesis, inflammation and vasoreactivity. However, a comprehensive assessment of exosomal cargo of healthy and dysfunctional pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) has been hindered by current low-yield exosome isolation techniques that integrates real-time exosome capture from PMVECs exposed to PAH-associated high shear stress.

"Utilization of Advanced Technologies for the Understanding of Human Structural Birth Defects PROJECT SUMMARY The unifying theme of this proposal is the aim to use state-of-the-art technologies to investigate the basic biology of mammalian organ development and human structural birth defects. Our approach is wide-ranging, and aims to demonstrate how utilization of powerful technologies can inform many disorders. Importantly, this proposal marries a number of strengths of investigators at Seattle Children’s Research Institute and the University of Washington Department of Genome Sciences; specifically, expertise in the diagnosis and understanding of human congenital malformation syndromes and mammalian developmental biology, and the application of powerful new techniques for biological investigation. In Project 1, we propose to use single-cell RNA sequencing (sci-RNA-seq) technology to characterize mid- gestation embryos of mice carrying mutations relevant to human structural birth defects. Essentially, we are proposing to utilize sci-RNA-seq as a phenotype, with which one can annotate changes in expression and cell- type representation during abnormal organogenesis. Ideally, these profiles will be comparable to each other, and can potentially provide insight into fundamental biological pathways that are perturbed when developmentally important genes are lost. In Project 2, we will leverage recent advances in 3D imaging, computer vision and machine-learning to make the morphological characterization of mouse mutants more accurate, quantitative, reproducible and accessible. Progeny from the same lines studied in Project 1 will be harvested at E15.5 and imaged using microCT scanning. We will then employ several different data analysis techniques to identify differences in the tissue volume and shapes in the mutant mice compared to synthetic image constructed from a pool of ‘normative’ samples. The goal of Project 3 is to use novel technologies in prospective cohorts of children with structural birth defects to identify genetic variation not ascertained by current methods. These “hidden” variants include structural rearrangements, as well as DNA mutations that arise post-zygotically and are not present in blood-derived DNA. We will use long-read based DNA and RNA sequencing methods, or deep short-read based DNA sequencing of multiple, non-blood derived tissues, on patients with structural birth defects whose clinical workup has been non-diagnostic.

"Integrative Molecular Epidemiology Approach to Identify Nephrotic Syndrome Subgroups ABSTRACT Although patients with Nephrotic Syndrome (NS) present with shared clinical signs and symptoms (proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia and edema), there is dramatic variability in prognosis and response to therapy, frustrating patients, families and their clinicians. Even within the histopathologic categories used in the current diagnostic approach (e.g. minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis), there is dramatic variability in disease progression and response to therapy, highlighting the underlying biological heterogeneity within the groups. Small studies with broad, clinical patient inclusion criteria have demonstrated that a subset of patients respond well to anti-TNF therapy, but accurate pre-treatment response of those individuals is not possible based on routine clinical parameters. This project will leverage the Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE) cohort study, a multi-center prospective study of 600 patients with FSGS, MCD and MN with rich clinical data, kidney biopsy tissue and gene expression profiles. This study will leverage the kidney tissue gene expression data to identify a subgroup of patients with TNF-alpha pathway activation, assess associated clinical outcomes and identify non- molecular predictors of the subgroup. The aims are:  Aim 1: To identify a subgroup of Nephrotic Syndrome patients with homogeneous activation of the  TNF-alpha transcriptional pathway.  Aim 2: To compare molecular subgroups with conventional clinical-pathologic classification in  clinical outcome prediction.  Aim 3: To identify non-invasive markers (e.g. demographics, blood and urine markers), standard  pathology features and novel pathologic biopsy descriptors associated with the TNF-alpha subgroup. To accomplish this project, the applicant will pursue formal training in systems biology, genetic epidemiology and bioinformatics. She will be mentored by a multi-disciplinary team with expertise in systems biology, epidemiology and bioinformatics. The long term objective is to improve the clinical care of patients with Nephrotic Syndrome by improved understanding of the underlying biology, identifying novel biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for future validation in animal models and mechanistic-based interventional clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Nephrotic Syndrome, caused by several rare kidney diseases, is characterized by an abnormal amount of protein in the urine, swelling and kidney failure. Patients affected by the syndrome suffer complications of the disease as well as the toxicity of the immunosuppressive therapy used to treat it, but their individual presentations, response to treatment and prognosis can vary markedly. This project aims to use gene expression levels from kidney biopsy tissue to identify the subgroup patients most likely to respond to TNF- alpha blocking medications, an approach which, if validated, may help to inform targeted therapy selections for these patients.",Integrative Molecular Epidemiology Approach to Identify Nephrotic Syndrome Subgroups,10153763,K08DK115891,"['Affect ', ' Award ', '

"Multimodal computational models to stratify ovarian cancer patients Project Summary/Abstract High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy, with a five-year survival rate of less than 30% for metastatic disease. Our lab has identified mutational processes as predictors of survival and response to therapy, along with a working model to predict homologous recombination deficiency from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) whole-slide images. Our collaborators in diagnostic radiology have discovered robust associations between BRCA mutational status and qualitative features on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT). These two imaging modalities, however, have yet to be combined with genomic information to improve stratification of HGSC patients. Based on these preliminary data, I will test the hypothesis that combined mesoscopic information in CE-CT and microscopic information in H&E can be used to infer known mutational subtypes and also to identify novel patient strata. I have curated a cohort of 118 HGSC patients with matched targeted panel-based genome sequencing, scanned H&E whole-slide images, and segmented pre-treatment CE-CT images for this purpose. In Specific Aim 1, I will develop a machine learning model to integrate CE-CT and H&E imaging to predict mutational subtype from these ubiquitous imaging modalities. In Specific Aim 2, I will develop an end-to-end deep learning model to integrate the complementary information from CE-CT, H&E, and genome sequencing for survival analysis using a Cox Proportional Hazards model. I anticipate that this work will (1) identify refined stratification of HGSC patients using this multimodal prognostic signature and (2) develop a general-purpose machine learning model to integrate CE-CT, H&E, and genomic sequencing for cancer patient survival analysis. This research will be conducted at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center under the mentorship of Dr. Sohrab Shah. The training plan that Dr. Shah and I have developed will prepare me well for a future as a physician- scientist conducting machine learning research for cancer patient prognosis. Project Narrative Mutational subtypes of high-grade serous ovarian cancer stratify patients by clinical outcome, yet genomic sequencing omits spatial information with potential prognostic relevance. In the proposed project, I aim to (1) infer mutational subtype by combining radiologic and histologic imaging and (2) identify refined patient strata by integrating radiologic and histologic imaging with genomic sequencing. Completion of this work will identify new strata of ovarian cancer patients and result in new machine learning models to integrate cancer imaging with genomic sequencing.",Multimodal computational

"Treatment Approaches and Outcomes in Pouch-related Disorders after Colectomy for Ulcerative Colitis PROJECT SUMMARY This overall goal of this mentored patient-oriented research career development award is to improve our understanding of pouchitis and other inflammatory conditions after restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA). Dr. Barnes is a motivated clinical researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC), with a specific interest in the study of inflammatory bowel diseases. Over the next five years, Dr. Barnes will work with his mentorship committee to continue his progression towards his goal of independence. His mentorship committee includes experts in gastrointestinal epidemiology and comparative effectiveness (Kappelman), patient reported outcomes [(PROs) DeWalt], and precision medicine (Kosorok). Each member has an established track record of mentoring junior faculty, consistent peer-reviewed support, and high research productivity. Dr. Barnes’s career development objectives are as follows: 1) develop a new skillset in comparative effectiveness research using real-world data; 2) obtain knowledge and experience in the development of PRO assessments; 3) acquire new skills in machine learning and precision medicine principles which will allow for the incorporation of clinical and microbiota data into new risk modeling for patients undergoing restorative proctocolectomy with IPAA, and 4) transition to independence. To achieve his career development objectives, Dr. Barnes will participate in structured coursework, conduct mentored research, and will participate in workshops through the North Carolina Translational and Clinical Sciences Institute, including the R-Writing Group. The research and training environment at UNC is well established. For fiscal year 2019, UNC ranked tenth among both private and public universities nationwide for National Institutes of Health (NIH) research funding to domestic institutions of higher education. The specific aims of this research project are 1) to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of specific biologic therapies for the treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions of the pouch after IPAA; 2) to develop PRO items for evaluating quality of life and specific symptom domains among patients after IPAA. Techniques for PRO development will include identifying symptom domains relevant to patients after IPAA using qualitative research methods, selecting candidate items for IPAA-specific PROs using existing PRO instruments where appropriate, and performing cognitive interviews with patients after IPAA to ensure content validity; and 3) to demonstrate novel methods for identifying predictors of chronic pouchitis using a machine learning approach. Expanding an existing prospective cohort, Dr. Barnes will utilize the stool microbiome, laboratory data and clinical variables to create signatures for identifying predictors of chronic pouchitis. The combination of mentorship, didactics, and research experiences offered through this K23 proposal will allow Dr. Barnes to develop a unique skillset that will aid in his ultimate transition to independence as a clinical investigator and research scientist. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) is the most common surgery for refractory ulcerative colitis and ulcerative colitis-related dysplasia, multiple complications can occur. Short and long-term complications include inflammatory conditions of the pouch such as acute and chronic pouchitis and Crohn’s-like disease of the pouch, each of which can require new medical treatments after surgery and can significantly impact the quality of life of individual patients. This mentored patient-oriented research career development project will generate evidence about the comparative effectiveness of therapies for the treatment of these inflammatory conditions of the pouch, will develop new IPAA-specific patient-reported assessments of pouch symptoms and quality of life, and will utilize precision medicine techniques including machine learning to identify patients at high-risk for developing chronic pouchitis.",Treatment Approaches and Outcomes in Pouch-related Disorders after Colectomy for Ulcerative Colitis,10103883,K23DK127157,"['Affect ', ' Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Anus ', ' Anal ', ' Award ', ' Biological Response Modifier Therapy ', ' Biologic Therapy ', ' Biological Therapy ', ' biological therapeutic ', ' biological treatment ', ' biotherapeutics ', ' biotherapy ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Colectomy ', ' Ulcerative Colitis ', ' Ulcerated Colitis ', ' Counseling ', "" Crohn's disease "", ' Crohn disease ', "" Crohn's "", "" Crohn's disorder "", ' Granulomatous Enteritis ', ' eleocolitis ', ' regional enteritis ', ' Crowding ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' indexing ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Disorder ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' North Carolina ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Measures ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Privatization ', ' Productivity ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Restorative Proctocolectomy ', ' Restorative Coloproctectomy ', ' Outcome Assessment ', ' Ileal Reservoirs ', ' Ileal Pouches ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', "" large bowel Crohn's disease "", "" Crohn's Colitis "", ' granulomatous colitis ', "" large intestine Crohn's disease "", ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Refractory ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy ', ' anti-TNF therapy ', ' anti-TNF-alpha therapy ', ' Inflammatory ', ' dyscrasia ', ' Dysplasia ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pouch Ileitis ', ' Pouchitis ', ' Scientist ', ' Frequencies ', ' Techniques ', ' gastrointestinal ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' Anastomosis ', ' Anastomosis -

"Elucidating Genetic and Environmental Second Hits in Racial and Ethnic Minorities with APOL1 High-Risk Genotypes PROJECT SUMMARY This is an application by an early stage investigator who has the long-term objective of studying determinants of racial and ethnic disparities in kidney disease. Risk variants in the Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene on chromosome 22 are common in persons of African ancestry (African Americans and Afro-Caribbean Hispanic Americans) and are one of the most powerful disease variants identified to date in terms of frequency and effect size. This is an important discovery for kidney disease and has furthered our understanding of racial/ethnic disparities in kidney disease. There are efforts underway to incorporate APOL1 genetic testing in clinical settings including in pre-transplant evaluation and targeted therapies are on the horizon. However, the presence of two risk variants (i.e. the APOL1 high-risk genotypes, seen in up to 14% of African Americans and 4% of Afro-Caribbean Hispanic Americans) does not lead to overt kidney disease in all individuals. This incomplete penetrance indicates a major role of either genetic or environmental modifiers i.e. ‘second hits’. Although some genetic modifiers have been discovered, previous studies have been hampered by lack of sample sizes due to underrepresentation of minorities. There are also strong associations between air pollution, adverse neighborhood environment (including walkability and poverty) and podocyte toxic heavy metals (Arsenic, Cadmium and Mercury) with kidney disease and racial/ethnic minorities are disproportionately exposed to these environmental risk factors. We propose a robust research strategy leveraging several large datasets/cohorts to comprehensively investigate the genetic and environmental ‘second-hits’ for the APOL1- kidney disease association through the following Specific Aims: : To identify and replicate SNPs that modify the association of the APOL1 high-risk genotypes with kidney disease (Aim 1). Using genetic and clinical data on ~70,000 minority individuals (~5,400 with APOL1 high-risk genotypes), we will investigate SNPs modifying the association between APOL1 high-risk genotype and kidney disease. We will then perform replication of the top performing hits in ~25,000 independent individuals (~5,000 with APOL1 high-risk genotypes). We will then assess the interaction of air pollution (particulate matter<2.5 µg or PM2.5) and adverse measures of neighborhood walkability/poverty with APOL1 high-risk for kidney disease (Aim 2) using geographically diverse studies: BioMe Biobank; Jackson Heart Study and REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) in ~40,000 individuals (~3,600 with APOL1 high-risk genotypes). Finally, we will explore the interaction between urine levels of Arsenic, Cadmium and Mercury with APOL1 high-risk genotypes for kidney disease in a case-control study from REGARDS (n=2,332) and in exploratory analyses assess whether soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) levels-an inflammatory APOL1 modifier-affects this interaction (Aim 3). This proposal will lead to critical insights on genetic and environmental ‘second hits’ for APOL1 and improved understanding of racial/ethnic disparities in kidney disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE. Mutations in a specific gene (Apolipoprotein L1 or APOL1) seen only in people of African ancestry (African Americans or Hispanic Americans) is linked to high rates of kidney disease, with only some of the individuals with these mutations developing kidney disease, indicating that other genetic or environmental factors are involved. We will explore these factors including other genes and common environmental exposures like air pollution/neighborhood environment, and heavy metal exposure. We will understand what additional risk factors contribute to kidney disease in individuals with this mutation, which will lead to preventative efforts to address the persistent racial and ethnic disparities in kidney disease.",Elucidating Genetic and Environmental Second Hits in Racial and Ethnic Minorities with APOL1 High-Risk Genotypes,10100412,R01DK127139,"['Affect ', ' Air Pollution ', '

"Machine learning with immunogenetics for the prediction of hematopoietic cell transplant outcomes ABSTRACT Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the only curative treatment for most forms of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), but its 50% failure rate remains unacceptably high, with the principal causes of death due to disease relapse and graft-versus-host disease. When successful, HCT prevents leukemic relapse due to a graft versus leukemia effect, co-mediated by T cell and natural killer (NK) cell immune functions. Selection of donors whose allografts will provide higher NK anti-leukemic response potential but low GVHD risk remains a major unmet need in HCT.  The polygenic, polymorphic KIR receptors, in combination with their HLA ligands, control NK function, dictating NK repertoire content and establishing thresholds for NK cell response in a process called “NK education”. Large retrospective studies in HCT have demonstrated that specific KIR-HLA allele combinations associated with NK education are predictive for relapse control, but they represent only a fraction of known KIR-HLA interactions. Furthermore, out of the thousands of phenotypes present in the NK repertoire, the NK population(s) responsible for leukemia control in HCT is unknown and they likely differ between transplant pairs. Aim 1 proposes a machine learning approach to integrate NK genotype, phenotype, and function to identify how genotype determines overall repertoire response and which subpopulations contribute most to global response. Parallel statistical modeling of NK genotypes and HCT outcome in a cohort of 2800 AML patient may confirm the same genotypes that are potent for global response also play a role in HCT outcomes but may also identify unexpected ones.  HLA is the most important determinant of GVHD risk. Precise HLA matching lowers the risk for GVHD, but for patients who lack HLA-compatible donors, predicting permissible HLA mismatches is a paramount and unmet need. Two lineages of HLA-B allotypes exist based on the M and T leader peptide dimorphism, and GVHD risk in HLA-mismatched HCT differs depending on the match status of the leader. The division of the HLA-B locus into two lineages provides a novel approach for mapping functional motifs in transplantation that removes reduces the sheer numbers of polymorphic positions that previously precluded examination of more than 1 residue at a time. Machine learning approaches using HLA data from more than 11,000 transplant patients will permit assessment of the full spectrum of lineage variation and the relationship between T-cell and NK alloresponses. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of the proposed study is to determine how two different immune cells, known as natural killer cells and T cells, work to recognize cancer cells and cause destruction of healthy tissues in patients receiving a bone marrow transplant. Understanding what stimulates these behaviors will help research scientists and physicians to make bone marrow transplants more successful at curing cancer.",Machine learning with immunogenetics for the prediction of hematopoietic cell transplant outcomes,10101252,R01HL155741,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Behavior ', ' Bone Marrow Transplantation ', ' Bone Marrow Grafting ', ' Bone Marrow Transplant ', ' Marrow Transplantation ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Genotype ', ' graft vs host disease ', ' GvHD ', ' Homologous Wasting Disease ', ' Runt Disease ', ' graft versus host disease ', ' graft vs. host disease ', ' HLA-B Antigens ', ' HLA-B ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Immunogenetics ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Influentials ', ' Natural Killer Cells ', ' Cytotoxic cell ', ' K lymphocyte ', ' NK Cells ', ' leukemia ', ' Acute Myelocytic Leukemia ', ' AML - Acute Myeloid Leukemia ', ' Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia ', ' Acute Myelogenous Leukemia ', ' acute granulocytic leukemia ', ' acute myeloid leukemia ', ' Ligands ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Peptides ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Cell Surface Receptors ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Retrospective Studies ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' T-Cells ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' peptide B ', ' proenkephalin peptide B ', ' Mediating ', ' Immunologist ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' NK cell receptor NKB1 ', ' KIR3DL1 ', ' NKB1 receptor ', ' Recurrent disease ', ' Relapsed Disease ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' transplant patient ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' Scientist ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Allografting ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' cohort ', ' GVL ', ' graft versus leukemia ', ' graft vs leukemia ', ' graft vs leukemia response ', ' graft vs. leukemia ', ' graft vs. leukemia effect ', ' graft vs. leukemia response ', ' graft vs leukemia effect ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Leader Peptide ', ' Leader Signal Peptide ', ' Peptide Leader Sequences ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Cellular Immune Function ', ' immune function ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Receptor Gene ', ' Donor Screening ', ' Donor Selection ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' in vivo ', ' Allogenic ', ' Antitumor Response ', ' anti-tumor response ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Gene Combinations ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' dimorphism ', ' T cell response ', ' hematopoietic cell transplantation ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' curative treatments ', ' curative intervention ', ' curative therapeutic ', ' curative therapy ', ' relapse prediction ', ' predict relapse ', ' adaptive immune response ', ' Data Scientist ', ' leukemia relapse ', ' ']",NHLBI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2021,650223,NY-12
"Driver Genes for Engineered Rotator Cuff Development Rotator cuff tears affect over 15% of Americans and impair shoulder joint biomechanics and function. Following repair of symptomatic tears, functional deficits frequently persist and re-tears are common, due to the complex anatomy and high functional demands on the rotator cuff tendons. Rotator cuff tendon tissue engineering research is focused on devices to improve immediate mechanical support to the repair and to stimulate early and rapid tendon regeneration rather than scarring and fibrosis, particularly for the supraspinatus tendon (SST), the most commonly torn tendon in the rotator cuff. Aligned electrospun scaffolds that mimic both the highly aligned medial region of the SST, and bi-axially aligned electrospun scaffolds that mimic the multi-axially aligned isotropic anterior region of the SST have been evaluated with promising results when seeded with adipose- derived stem cells (ASCs). However, progress in this area of rotator cuff tendon engineering and in other areas of tendon research is hindered by the lack of definitive markers for SST or for its regional heterogeneity, the lack of understanding to what extent ASCs are tenogenic and can assume the identity of tendon fibroblasts, the lack of specific markers for tendon fibroblast identity and tenogenic differentiation, and by a lack of markers for tendon maturation and response to mechanical loading in engineered tendon. Therefore, is it difficult to assess how successful current tendon tissue engineering approaches really are, or to predict how well tendon tissue engineered approaches will function in translation when autologous or allogeneic ASCs from diverse human populations are used to enhance rotator cuff repair via augmentation or interposition with engineered tendon devices. These studies will evaluate the epigenome (methylome), transcriptome, proteome, lipidome, metabolome and phenome (phenotype) of native human SST and donor-matched tissue engineered tendon produced from SST fibroblasts and ASCs. Bioinformatics approaches will be used to integrate the data to an integrated multiome, which will then be used with machine learning approaches to extract key causal ‘driver’ genes, or tendon specific genes or molecules responsible for: 1) SST heterogeneity between medial and anterior regions. 2) Tendon cell identity and the extent of tenogenesis by ASCs on electrospun scaffolds. 3) The heterogenetic response by ASCs on uni- vs. bi-axially aligned electrospun scaffolds that mimic the native heterogeneity of the SST. 4) The response of engineered tendon to dynamic loading. Identified driver genes or molecules will be validated though over-expression or silencing approaches, thus providing therapeutic targets for manipulation to enhance tenogenesis, and engineered tendon development and maturation. Together these innovative studies will provide a template for improved external validity of benchtop tendon tissue engineering and pre-clinical studies towards successful translation in diverse patient populations. In addition, the bioinformatics and multiomics toolboxes and assays that result from this work will be invaluable to not only the tendon research community, but also to the wider musculoskeletal and regenerative medicine fields. A small number of driver genes in other medical fields are responsible for changes in expression and protein levels in hundreds of other genes, and subsequent tissue metabolism. The process of tissue engineered rotator cuff tendon development and formation as it relates to adult tendon after surgical repair is not well understood, despite rotator cuff tears being an important clinical problem and representing almost one third of orthopedic injuries. Evaluating changes in the ability of genes to be translated to proteins at the DNA, RNA, small metabolite, and protein level of tissue engineered tendon formation under different loading conditions compared to normal adult tendon will identify driver genes and potential new ways to improve currently available options for rotator cuff repair.",Driver Genes for Engineered Rotator Cuff Development,10098302,R01AR073882,"['Adipose tissue ', ' Fatty Tissue ', ' adipose ', ' white adipose tissue ', ' yellow adipose tissue ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Biocompatible Materials ', ' Biomaterials ', ' biological material ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Cadaver ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cicatrix ', ' Scars ', ' Communities ', ' Cues ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Engineering ', ' Extracellular Matrix ', ' Cell-Extracellular Matrix ', ' ECM ', ' Fibroblasts ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Genes ', ' Head ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methylation ', ' Orthopedics ', ' Orthopedic ', ' Orthopedic Surgical Profession ', ' Phenotype ', ' Proteins ', ' Natural regeneration ', ' Regeneration ', ' regenerate ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Seeds ', ' Plant Embryos ', ' Plant Zygotes ', ' seed ', ' Joint structure of shoulder region ', ' Glenohumeral Joint ', ' Shoulder Joint ', ' stem cells ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Tendon structure ', ' Tendons ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Rotator Cuff ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' improved ', ' Anterior ', ' Medial ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' repaired ', ' repair ', ' Biochemical ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Genetic ', ' scaffolding ', ' scaffold ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Autologous ', ' Techniques ', ' Musculoskeletal ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' Supraspinatus ', ' supraspinatus muscle ', ' American ', ' bioengineered tissue ', ' engineered tissue ', ' Tissue Engineering ', ' Devices ', ' Proteome ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Regenerative Medicine ', ' Mesenchymal Progenitor Cell ', ' Mesenchymal progenitor ', ' Mesenchymal Stem Cells ', ' Mechanical Stimulation ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Harvest ', ' Allogenic ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Engineered Gene ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' preclinical study ', ' pre-clinical study ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' spatial relationship ', ' therapeutic target ', ' overexpression ', ' overexpress ', ' patient population ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' regenerative ', ' phenome ', ' phenomics ', ' methylome ', ' epigenome ', ' tendon development ', ' tendon growth ', ' tendon maturation ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' rotator cuff tear ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' metabolome ', ' metabonome ', ' mechanical load ', ' mechanical properties ', ' translation to humans ', ' lipidome ', ' ']",NIAMS,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,479770,IN-04
"Knowledge Management Center for Illuminating the Druggable Genome The main goal of the Knowledge Management Center (KMC) for the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) program is to aggregate, update and articulate protein-centric data, information and knowledge for the entire human proteome with emphasis on understudied proteins from the 3 families that are the focus of the IDG (“IDG List”). The long-term objective of the KMC is to encourage and support biomedical research aimed at understudied proteins by providing an extensive resource of data, information, knowledge, methods and reagents for the entire human proteome, and to support the growing online community focused on understudied proteins.

"Integrating Machine Learning and Genomic Approaches to Understand Cerebral Small Vessel Disease Pathogenesis from White Matter Hyperintensity Patterns PROJECT SUMMARY  As a neurointensivist and neurologist at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (WUSM), my career goal is to develop an independent research program as a computational biologist capable of using advanced bioinformatics and statistical methods to integrate analysis of large-scale neuroimaging and genetic data, with the aim of deepening understanding of the biological mechanisms influencing cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) and identifying new targets for therapeutic development. As a first step towards this goal, I have designed an innovative proposal that combine machine-learning (ML) methods and integrated imaging genetic analyses of large-scale neuroimaging and genetic data to improve characterization of SVD disease mechanisms.  The clinical, imaging, and etiologic heterogeneity of SVD have impeded efforts to uncover the pathophysiology of this common and debilitating neurological disease. White matter hyperintensities (WMH), a major imaging endpoint of SVD, are comprised of multiple SVD pathologic processes. Growing evidence suggests location-specific vulnerability of brain parenchyma to different underlying SVD pathologic processes, in which spatially localized WMH patterns may reflect distinct SVD etiologies. Characterizing WMH spatial pattern variations in SVD will not only provide insights into underlying pathogenesis, such as vascular amyloid deposition, arteriolosclerosis, and other less well defined or as-yet unknown disease mechanisms, but also lead to creation of novel imaging biomarkers of these SVD pathologic processes. This proposal addresses a key inadequacy, as existing WMH pattern definitions are determined empirically and cannot distinguish overlapping SVD etiologies and risk factors. In this proposal, I aim to capture WMH spatial pattern variations that reflect distinct SVD etiologies in an unbiased manner, by applying clustering analysis/ML methods to structural MRI data to create novel etiology-specific SVD imaging phenotypes. Moreover, given that genetics influence the variance of WMH, I will integrate genetic analyses of these WMH patterns to uncover novel mechanisms that influence SVD pathogenesis. My preliminary data demonstrate the feasibility of identifying data-driven WMH spatial pattern variations, which are specific to distinct SVD etiologies, and allow detection of genetic risk variants that may help inform SVD pathologic processes.  My career plan leverages the extensive resources and exceptional environments at WUSM, under the guidance of a multidisciplinary mentorship team with expertise across diverse fields including cerebrovascular physiology, neuroimaging, informatics, genetics, and machine learning (Drs. Jin-Moo Lee, Daniel Marcus, Carlos Cruchaga and Yasheng Chen). In this Career Development Award, I propose to: 1) determine distinct WMH spatial patterns that can discriminate underlying SVD pathology and/or risk factors by applying pattern analysis ML methods to structural MRI data from three unique cohorts (n=2,710) enriched for different SVD pathologies (Aim 1a), and examining if the ML-defined WMH patterns segregate individuals by well-defined SVD risk factors as biologic validation (Aim 1b), and 2) identify genetic variants (Aim 2a) associated with WMH patterns that reflect diverse pathologic processes influencing SVD using genome wide association and gene-based analyses; replicate the top variants (Aim 2b) in an independent population-based cohort (n=21,708); and use advanced bioinformatics tools to uncover new biologic pathways associated with WMH spatial patterns (Aim 2c).  This research proposal and accompanying development plan with focused training in machine learning, neuroimaging, and multivariate methods for integrated imaging genetics analysis, will build on my background in genetics towards a career investigating cerebrovascular disorders using translational bioinformatics. This Award will provide me with the necessary training to evolve into an independent investigator with a computational research program that can integrate large imaging and genetics datasets to derive results that are highly relevant to the prevention and treatment of cerebrovascular disease in my clinical patient population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is one of the most prevalent neurological conditions in older adults, and a leading cause of stroke and cognitive impairment, for which existing treatment and preventative options have been limited or lack efficacy. This project’s goal is to enhance our knowledge of the complex disease processes underlying SVD using machine learning and integrating individual imaging and genetic data from over 20,000 adults.

"Use of a Machine Learning Approach to Impute Gene Expression in African Americans PROJECT SUMMARY Multi-omics data has been invaluable in understanding the potential mechanisms behind SNP associations. Using paired genomic and transcriptomic data allows investigators to determine the tissue specific effects of non-coding variation. However, most of this type of data exists for mostly European ancestry populations. Linear models have been developed which that can impute gene expression from genotype data  mostly created from the GTEx resource. This resource contains paired genotype and gene expression data on 44 human tissues. Unfortunately, these models are built mostly on European data; they do not perform as well on African American (AA) cohorts. To alleviate this disparity in both knowledge and data we are proposing to use both or own African American paired data as well as public African American data to create linear and machine learning models to impute gene expression. We will then assess the utility of these models in predicting the risk on venous thromboembolism in our ACCOuNT cohort. By building on our current knowledge of transcriptome imputation, we will be advancing these methods to understudies admixed populations. NARRATIVE Paired genomic and transcriptomic data has previously been used to create gene expression imputation models. However, the majority of the data used to create these models were from European Ancestry individuals.

"The Monarch Initiative: Linking diseases to model organism resources ABSTRACT Biomedical researchers need to identify novel disease genes and understand disease mechanisms; clinicians need to diagnose diseases and optimize treatments. An improved understanding of the genetic basis of disease helps achieve both goals. The Monarch Initiative makes this possible by integrating the fragmented data landscape into the most comprehensive open collection of genotype-phenotype data in the world. Our Knowledge Graph (KG) links together clinical, biomedical, and basic science research data spanning multiple organisms, and supports reasoning across a wide range of organisms, body systems, and diseases. Monarch has achieved demonstrable clinical and translational success using model organism data to perform rare disease diagnosis and gene-to-disease discovery, and our resources have become global standards. In Phase II, we integrated the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) into the UMLS; enhanced our variant prioritization algorithms and Exomiser tool, which was applied to 30,000 patients in the National Health Service (UK); developed the Biolink Model/API; released new ontologies (Mondo unified disease ontology, Unified Phenotype Ontology (uPheno), and the Environmental Conditions and Treatments Ontology (ECTO)), raised the number of harmonized data sources in our KG to 34; and overhauled our web Portal. We will leverage this foundation to make Monarch more intuitive for a diversity of users and contexts in phase III as follows: Augment the Monarch Portal with new visualizations and tools. Guided by user requirements, iterative user testing, and feedback, we propose to enhance the user experience and Portal functionality, focusing our work on improvements to Navigation, Visualization, and Query. Evaluate, optimize, and enhance algorithms for disease diagnostics, cross-species inference, and gene-disease discovery. We will develop a comprehensive, modular evaluation framework, ‘PhEval,’ that will allow us to monitor the diagnostic yield and performance of cross-species inference as our ontologies and data graphs evolve. This will assist basic science researchers and clinicians to reveal cross-species mechanistic evidence and evaluate potential precision disease modeling strategies. Disseminate computational tools, data, services, and tutorials to a broad translational community. We will expand access to our KG to enable users to process the KG for different domains and use cases, through simplified downloads, APIs, software libraries, R packages, Jupyter notebooks, and Dockerized resources, along with training materials. This will better support bioinformaticians and other researchers in leveraging our KG and phenotype data in their analyses. The Monarch Initiative aims to significantly improve the utilization, accessibility, and value of animal models for disease diagnosis and discovery. NARRATIVE To understand disease mechanisms and develop effective treatments, we need to untangle the relationship between genetics and phenotypes of all organisms (such as human, mouse, zebrafish, and fruitfly). Sophisticated comparative information systems are needed to collect, search, and compare the diverse and often mutually incompatible data being generated.

"Defining Phenotypes of Alcohol-Associated Liver Disease with Acute Hepatic Decompensation Project Summary Alcohol consumption and mortality due to alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) are increasing in the United States, and ALD is now the leading cause of liver transplantation. The natural history of ALD is distinct from other etiologies of liver disease, with more advanced disease at the time of presentation but also opportunity for hepatic recovery. Accurate prediction of outcome remains challenging. The proposed research will establish a prospective registry and biorepository that will evaluate the outcomes of patients with ALD and alcohol use disorder who are hospitalized with acute hepatic decompensation. This study will take a multifaceted approach, considering the biologic and psychosocial influences on clinical outcomes. Patients will be recruited during hospitalization and followed for 2 years in the outpatient clinics, with longitudinal measures of alcohol use patterns, serum biomarkers, radiographic features, nutrition, frailty/sarcopenia, and non-invasive assessments of fibrosis, inflammation, and steatosis. Specific Aims: (1) Characterize the cohort and optimize retention procedures using frequent communication, collateral contacts, and technology-based resources, (2) Identify distinct trajectories of ALD using latent class trajectory analysis and the predictors of trajectory classification, and (3) Develop a patient-specific risk prediction model to predict hepatic recovery after an acute hepatic decompensation. These project aims will identify distinct phenotypes and predictors of outcome in ALD and improve prognostication to better target interventions and allocate resources. The principal investigator (PI) is a hepatologist and clinical researcher at Stanford University, with a long-term vision of improving care for patients with ALD. Her experience with outcomes research and her Master’s in Clinical Research and Epidemiology have prepared her well to execute the project aims. The proposed research and career development plan are well-supported by a multi-disciplinary mentorship team and the institution. The PI will acquire advanced skills in longitudinal data analysis and machine learning, as well as content expertise in alcohol research, which will allow her to apply advanced statistical techniques to optimize prediction of outcome in ALD in a clinically relevant context. In addition, she will have a well-characterized ALD registry and biorepository to serve as a platform for future translational and multicenter studies. This award will provide the PI with the protected time, mentorship, training, and research experience to develop an independent research career in ALD and improve our understanding of this serious and prevalent condition. Project Narrative Alcohol-associated liver disease represents a growing public health burden, particularly among younger age groups, women, and ethnic minorities, and is now the leading cause of liver transplantation in the United States. This project will identify predictors of outcome and improve prognostication in severely ill patients with alcohol- associated liver disease.

"Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences Career Development K12 Program PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The overall objective of the NEI Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Program Award at UCSD is to develop outstanding clinician scientists to successfully compete for NIH grants and emerge as leaders within academic ophthalmology. Through this institutional career development award, we will continue to mentor clinician scientists toward independent academic appointments in ophthalmology. Since 1991, the UC San Diego Shiley Eye Institute has excelled in mentoring the career development of clinician scientists throughout ophthalmology. Many of these individuals now have successful research and clinical careers around the world; they include Department Chairs, Division Chiefs, and impactful academicians. With continued funding, we will amplify these strengths through a structured program of mentoring, research, and education to identify and mentor the next generation of academic clinician scientists, across all subspecialty areas of ophthalmology. With an emphasis on recruiting strong applications from women and minority applicants, Scholars will be selected each year after their completion of a post-residency clinical fellowship in ophthalmology. The Scholar will undertake these activities in the area of basic and/or clinical sciences appropriate to their scientific focus, and by partnering with mentor(s) to facilitate career development. Each Scholar will be trained in clinically relevant research, statistics, scientific writing, grant preparation, ethics, leadership, and the responsible conduct of research. Additional aspects of the curriculum of each Scholar will be individualized by the Program Director (PI), Research Directors, Education Director, Executive Committee, Mentoring Group, and lead mentor based upon the Scholar's selected primary research track and his/her skills, background, and career goals.

"Harmonizing and Archiving of Large-scale Infant Neuroimaging Data Project Abstract The first postnatal years are an exceptionally dynamic and critical period of structural and functional development of the human brain. Many neurodevelopmental disorders are the consequence of abnormal brain development during this stage. Several NIH-funded studies have recently acquired and released large-scale infant brain MRI datasets in the National Institute of Mental Health Data Archive (NDA), leading to over 3,000 publically-available infant MRI scans from multiple imaging sites. Joint analysis of these big data of infant brains will undoubtedly improve our limited understanding of normative early brain development and neurodevelopmental disorders with boosted statistical power and reproducibility. However, the processed and harmonized data of these multi-site infant MR images still remain publically absent, due to the challenges in processing and analyzing infant MR images, which typically exhibit extremely low tissue contrast, large within-tissue intensity variations, and regionally-heterogeneous dynamic changes. To address this critical issue, the goal of this project is to comprehensively process, harmonize, discover and archive large-scale, multi-site public infant MRI datasets to significantly advance early brain development studies, by taking advantage of our infant-tailored computational tools and further developing advanced machine learning techniques. In Aim 1, we will extensively process large-scale infant MRI datasets by adopting our established and recently-improved infant- dedicated cortical surface-based computational tools and further develop a deep spherical neural network for quality control of produced cortical property maps. This will lead to quality-ensured vertex-wise maps of multiple biologically-distinct cortical properties, e.g., cortical thickness, surface area, myelin content, sulcal depth, local gyrification, curvature and diffusivity. In Aim 2, to remove site effects associated with different scanners and imaging protocols and meanwhile preserve biological associations, we will harmonize the computed cortical property maps from multi-site data in Aim 1 by leveraging our surface-to-surface cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks (S2SGAN) based on the spherical U-Net, without requiring traveling subjects (paired data) across sites. To further increase the efficiency and learn more robust feature representation in the whole multi- site data, we propose to extend S2SGAN to jointly harmonize all multi-site cortical property maps using a single generator. In Aim 3, leveraging the informative growth patterns and gradient information of the harmonized maps of multiple cortical properties in Aim 2, we will discover distinct cortical regions, by capitalizing on multi-view nonnegative matrix factorization in a data-driven manner, without making any assumption on the parametric forms of growth patterns. All our processed data, results, computational tools, and source codes will be deposited into NDA, NITRC, and GitHub to significantly accelerate the pace of early brain development studies. Project Narrative This project aims to comprehensively process, harmonize, discover, and archive large-scale, multi-site public infant neuroimaging data, by taking advantage of our pioneered infant-tailored computational tools and developing advanced machine learning techniques.

"T cells in the aging brain SUMMARY The overarching goal of this project is to understand how immune cells impact the brain during aging, with the objective of restoring old brain function. The brain has long been considered an ‘immuno-privileged organ’. However, recent studies have shown that immune cells infiltrate the brain in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and during aging. A key remaining challenge is to understand how immune cells impact the brain during aging, and could this knowledge be used to restore functionality of old brain and treat neurodegenerative diseases?  The subventricular zone (SVZ) of the adult brain provides a great paradigm to address this question, as this regenerative region of the brain contains many different cell types – neural stem cells (NSCs), endothelial cells, microglia – and exhibits clear functional decline during aging. To gain a single cell understanding of the changes that occur with age in neurogenic niches, we recently performed single cell RNA-sequencing of young and old neurogenic niches in mice. This analysis revealed a striking infiltration of cytotoxic T cells only in the old neurogenic niche, which was confirmed by immunofluorescence. Surprisingly, we found that T cells from old SVZs are clonally expanded and secrete interferon g (IFNg), suggesting that they have encountered specific antigens. We also showed that T cells can impair NSC proliferation both in co-cultures and in vivo. Based on these data, our specific hypothesis is that T cell clonal expansion in old brains drives the deterioration of the neurogenic niche with age, and that preventing this T cell expansion restores function to old neurogenic regions. Probing this idea would be critical to counter the decline in brain function during aging and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease. To test our hypothesis, we propose the following experiments: 1. To determine how T cells infiltrate neurogenic niches in old individuals; 2. To understand the functional impact of T cells on old neurogenic niches; 3. To examine the interaction between immune cells and neurogenic niches in young, old, and rejuvenated individuals.  Completion of these aims will provide unique mechanistic insights into the regulation of T cell and other immune cells during aging in regenerative niches of the brain. This work should also give a fundamental understanding of the mechanistic impact of the interferon response and T cell cytotoxicity on different cell types in the brain. Knowledge from our study should pave the way for building transformative strategies, including new immunotherapies, for the restoration of a pristine tissue, which will be a critical step for improving brain function during aging and age-related diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease. NARRATIVE As the organism ages, adult regenerative neural stem cell niches no longer produce new neurons. Adult neurogenic niches have been found to be important for aspects of learning and memory, raising the intriguing possibility that boosting the production of neurons by these niches may help preserve or enhance cognitive function with advancing age. Uncovering the immune-based mechanisms underlying the decline and rejuvenation of adult neurogenic niches during aging should give important insights into the factors that control regeneration in the normal aging nervous system as well as in age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease.",T cells in the aging brain,10184422,R01AG071711,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Animals ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clone Cells ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Exercise ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunotherapy ', ' Immune mediated therapy ', ' Immunologically Directed Therapy ', ' immune therapeutic approach ', ' immune therapeutic interventions ', ' immune therapeutic regimens ', ' immune therapeutic strategy ', ' immune therapy ', ' immune-based therapies ', ' immune-based treatments ', ' immuno therapy ', ' In Vitro ', ' Interferons ', ' IFN ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Memory ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Play ', ' Production ', ' Natural regeneration ', ' Regeneration ', ' regenerate ', ' Rejuvenation ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' T-Cells ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes ', ' Cell-Mediated Lympholytic Cells ', ' Cytolytic T-Cell ', ' Cytotoxic T Cell ', ' killer T cell ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' cytokine ', ' Immunofluorescence Immunologic ', ' Immunofluorescence ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Microglia ', ' Hortega cell ', ' gitter cell ', ' mesoglia ', ' microglial cell ', ' microgliocyte ', ' perivascular glial cell ', ' Evaluation ', ' Endothelial Cells ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Coculture Techniques ', ' Co-culture ', ' Cocultivation ', ' Coculture ', ' Infiltration ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' cognitive function ', ' exhaustion ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' cell type ', ' restoration ', ' Location ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' Lytotoxicity ', ' cytotoxicity ', ' T-cell depletion therapy ', ' T-lymphocyte depletion therapy ', ' T-Cell Depletion ', ' Immunomodulation ', ' immune modulation ', ' immune regulation ', ' immunologic reactivity control ', ' immunomodulatory ', ' immunoregulatory ', ' immunoregulation ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' neural function ', ' Neurophysiology -

"Integrative Predictors of Temporomandibular Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This application proposes the development of efficient web-based data management, mining, and analytics, to integrate and analyze clinical, biological, and high dimensional imaging data from TMJ OA patients. Based on our published results, we hypothesize that patterns of condylar bone structure, clinical symptoms, and biological mediators are unrecognized indicators of the severity of progression of TMJ OA. Efficiently capturing, curating, managing, integrating and analyzing this data in a manner that maximizes its value and accessibility is critical for the scientific advances and benefits that such comprehensive TMJ OA patient information may enable. High dimensional databases are increasingly difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional processing applications, creating a continuing demand for innovative approaches. Toward this end, the DCBIA at the Univ. of Michigan has partnered with the University of North Carolina, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and Kitware Inc. Through high-dimensional quantitative characterization of individuals with TMJ OA, at molecular, clinical and imaging levels, we will identify phenotypes at risk for more severe prognosis, as well as targets for future therapies. The proposed web-based system, the Data Storage for Computation and Integration (DSCI), will remotely compute machine learning, image analysis, and advanced statistics from prospectively collected longitudinal data on patients with TMJ OA. Due to its ubiquitous design in the web, DSCI software installation will no longer be required. Our long-term goal is to create software and data repository for Osteoarthritis of the TMJ. Such repository requires maintaining the data in a distributed computational environment to allow contributions to the database from multi-clinical centers and to share trained models for TMJ classification. In years 4 and 5 of the proposed work, the dissemination and training of clinicians at the Schools of Dentistry at the University of North Carol, Univ. of Minnesota and Oregon Health Sciences will allow expansion of the proposed studies. In Aim 1, we will test state-of-the-art neural network structures to develop a combined software module that will include the most efficient and accurate neural network architecture and advanced statistics to mine imaging, clinical and biological TMJ OA markers identified at baseline. In Aim 2, we propose to develop novel data analytics tools, evaluating the performance of various machine learning and statistical predictive models, including customized- Gaussian Process Regression, extreme boosted trees, Multivariate Varying Coefficient Model, Lasso, Ridge and Elastic net, Random Forest, pdfCluster, decision tree, and support vector machine. Such automated solutions will leverage emerging computing technologies to determine risk indicators for OA progression in longitudinal cohorts of TMJ health and disease.

"SPOTs: Optical Technologies for Instantly Quantifying Multicellular Response Profiles PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Human organ systems require temporally and spatially coordinated multicellular actions at a macroscale to actuate, sustain, or terminate dedicated and vital functions. Cells that comprise discrete or distributed physiologic systems that fail to respond to appropriate stimuli with coordination may cause significant morbidity and often mortality. Collective and coordinated physiologic activities typically involve millions to billions of cells that may span large physical distances. Technologies for quantifying the electrical, chemical, and mechanical coupling in these multicellular systems are critically important to understanding the underlying mechanisms of disease and develop therapeutic approaches. However, no technology currently exists to quantify rapid mechanical cell responses to transmitted distal perturbations for all cells within a collection of cells. This multi- PI proposal (Chiou (contact PI) and Teitell) aims to develop a new platform imaging technology called SPOT (single pixel optical technology) for concurrent and direct measurements of cellular traction forces over a 1.0 x 1.0 cm2 field of view (FOV) with cellular spatial resolution, and a 1,000 frames/sec temporal resolution. SPOT provides a 4-order of magnitude larger FOV than conventional traction force microscopy. Cardiomyocytes (CMs) are the test bed here because of a high potential for impact in cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of mortality in the Western World. We will demonstrate the ability for SPOT to determine quantitative indices of abnormalities for human CM contraction and relaxation in healthy and diseased states. We will establish proof of concept studies in SPOT screens for small molecules that augment or affect CM contraction in desmoplakin deficient states. We will build a platform that integrates SPOT for direct contraction force measurements and Optical Mapping for electrical property measurements for sheets of CMs. This will enable, for the first time, studies of temporal and spatial electromechanical coupling behaviors for sheets of CMs at single cell resolution. We will distinguish different subtypes of CMs, their distributions, their interactions, and their phenotypic responses under external perturbations. And we will apply this platform to investigate the structural and electromechanical coupling properties of hESC-derived CMs by integrating quantitative biomass and stiffness data measured using non-invasive live cell interferometry (LCI). Changes in biomass and cell stiffness are druggable biophysical parameters with correlates to mechanical contraction/relaxation cycles of CMs. In addition to detailed studies of CMs that have the potential to impact the number one killer of US citizens, SPOT applications should have utility and provide new insights in additional settings that require cell or tissue traction-force generation. Such settings could include models in a dish for wound healing, cancer cell metastasis, or models of diseases that affect cell and tissue structural integrity, such as connective tissue disorders Ehlers-Danlos or Marfan syndromes. PROJECT NARATIVE Our proposal is exclusively technology development but portends public health relevance because we will invent a way to quantify previously undiscoverable interactions and mechanical responses to external and internal perturbations in interconnected biological systems, as occurs in physiologic and pathologic states. We will develop, test and fine-tune a new technology platform called SPOT (Single Pixel Optical Technology) to extract mechanical responses at cellular resolution in a very wide field, in real-time, concurrently for all cells in a sheet to enable studies and potentially new-age therapeutics that are currently impossible.",SPOTs: Optical Technologies for Instantly Quantifying Multicellular Response Profiles,10160919,R01GM127985,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Beds ', ' Behavior ', ' Biomass ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Color ', ' Connective Tissue Diseases ', ' Connective Tissue Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Fibroblasts ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Heart Atrium ', ' Atrial ', ' Cardiac Atrium ', ' atrium ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Interferometry ', ' Marfan Syndrome ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' Metastasis ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastatic Lesion ', ' Metastatic Mass ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Phenotype ', ' Relaxation ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Traction ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' wound healing ', ' Wound Repair ', ' wound resolution ', ' desmoplakin ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Distal ', ' Area ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Series ', ' Chemicals ', ' Cardiac Myocytes ', ' Cardiac Muscle Cells ', ' Cardiocyte ', ' Heart Muscle Cells ', ' Heart myocyte ', ' cardiomyocyte ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Measurement ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Spottings ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy ', ' Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Western World ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' System ', ' Organ System ', ' body system ', ' measurement of electrical properties ', ' electrical measurement ', ' electrical property ', ' tech development ', ' technology development ', ' Structure ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' patch clamp ', ' hESC ', ' human ES cell ', ' human ESC ', ' human embryonic stem cell ', ' small molecule ', ' Address ', ' Defect ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Collection ', ' Giant Cells ', ' Multinucleated Giant Cells ', ' Polykaryocytes ', ' Syncytium ', ' Tzanck Cell ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Ventricular ', ' Cardiac ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Coupling ', ' public health relevance ', ' biological systems ', ' screening ', ' biophysical properties ', ' biophysical characteristics ', ' biophysical characterization ', ' biophysical measurement ', ' biophysical parameters ', ' imaging platform ', ' temporal measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' Pharmacology Study ', ' Pharmacological Study ', ' mechanical properties ', ' human pluripotent stem cell ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' genetic condition ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Drug Screening ', ' Traction Force Microscopy ', ' Regenerative research ', ' regeneration research ', ' regeneration studies ', ' regenerative studies ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,379224,CA-33
"Integrating multidimensional genomic data to discover clinically-relevant predictive models The goal of this NIH Pathway to Independence award is to provide Dr. Brittany Lasseigne with an extensive training program to prepare her to be an effective independent investigator who uses computational genomics to study complex human diseases. We propose a formal one-year training and mentoring program in genomics, computer science, statistics, and career development to build on her 8+ years of hands-on training, followed by a three-year structured and independent research program. Research will focus on the integration of multidimensional genomic data sets in the context of complex human diseases. A critical barrier in genomic research is the complexity of data integration: the ability to leverage overlapping and unique information captured by different genomic assays would improve our understanding of data integration and generate clinically relevant genomic signatures. To meet this need, we propose to integrate a combination of genomic data we generated with public data to (1) infer genomic instability signatures from different data types, (2) improve clinically relevant phenotype prediction by building multi-omics machine learning classifiers and reducing phenotype heterogeneity, and (3) create a cloud-enabled R package and associated Shiny application to accelerate future research. The proposed work will advance our understanding of data integration, allow inference of genomic instabilities across data sets, and generate high performance classifiers for assessing clinically relevant phenotypes in both cancer and psychiatric disease using frameworks that will be broadly applicable across other complex diseases. It will also facilitate prioritization of experiments in future studies by informing on the orthogonality of genomic assays, thereby allowing more efficient study designs to capture as much information as possible within a given sample size or scope of experimentation. Collectively, this additional training will allow Dr. Lasseigne to develop new multidimensional data integration approaches and translational questions applicable across complex diseases when independent. Dr. Richard Myers (HudsonAlpha) and Dr. Gregory Cooper (HudsonAlpha), leaders in applying genetics and genomics to complex human diseases, and an Advisory Committee of additional experts including Dr. Barbara Wold (Caltech), Dr. Eddy Yang (UAB), and Dr. Timothy Reddy (Duke), will provide mentoring throughout this award. The mentored phase will take place at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology, an ideal environment for this training with extensive translational science collaborations, expert faculty and staff, and state-of-the art computational and laboratory resources devoted to genomics. This combination will maximize Dr. Lasseigne's training program, facilitating her transition to an independent, tenure-track investigator at a university with a strong commitment to data-driven approaches to complex human disease research, i.e. strong genomics research programs with clinical collaborators, ideally at, or affiliated with, an academic medical center. Project Narrative The major outcome of this project will be a scientist with the necessary research, mentoring, teaching, and career development training to run an independent research program in computational genomics.

"SERS diagnostics platform for liquid bioapsy analysis of tumor-associated exosomes Project Summary/Abstract For ovarian cancer (OvCa), only 27% of women diagnosed at advanced stages survive 5 years, yet more than 90% of patients survive when diagnosed at an earlier stage. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new non- invasive technologies capable of rapidly diagnosing ovarian cancers (OvCa) in early stage. Fortuitously, all cells (and tumor cells to a greater extent) expel nanoscale vesicles that are directly reflective of the biological state of their parent cells. A subset of circulating EVs known as exosomes are composed of biomolecules spanning the range of lipids, proteins, genes, and more, and hold great potential for the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer. Yet current methods for phenotyping biofluids according to detection of tumor-associated exosomes (TEXs) are not meeting clinical standards and fail to precisely capture particle to particle heterogeneity. We propose to develop a new nanoplasmonics-based technology for sensitive detection of cancer-related exosome bio-signatures enabled by multiplexed surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, that we call ExoSERS. Our approach encompasses three aims devised to realize the ExoSERS platform. Aim 1 outlines development of a new class of Raman-active ligands to serve as the molecular barcodes. This aim encompasses the design and synthesis of polyyne-based ligands designed to confer Raman spectroscopic encoding and also initiate a silane coating to form a protecting shell around a nanoplasmonic core. Aim 2 describes the synthesis and optimization of nanoplasmonic core-shell structures that will be well-suited to binding EVs. An inner gold core structure yields plasmonic enhancement, while the outer silica shell permits long-term stability and a convenient surface for covalent decoration with exosome and cancer-specific surface marker targeting agents. Aim 3 comprises validation of the platform’s feasibility to profile human OvCa patient plasma, including machine learning approaches to type cancers using the barcoded approach. Endpoints of platform characterization will be statistical validation of exosome detection efficiency, minimal sample volume needed, ease of utilization, and low cost. Several quantitative milestones have been proposed to gauge our progress and provide deliverables to the larger diagnostic and circulating biomarker communities. Project Narrative All cells dynamically excrete into circulation nano-sized packages called extracellular vesicles (EVs), but this pathway can be hijacked by cancer cells for means of immune system suppression and metastasis. Innovative cross-disciplinary engineering methods are urgently needed to realize the diagnostic application of circulating cancer EVs to improve early detection of diseases like ovarian cancer, which do not have effective early screening tests. This project encompasses the design of highly multiplexed new nanoplasmonic probes for sensitive chemical fingerprinting of targeted circulating EVs, to ultimately improve the limit of detection for diagnosing ovarian cancer compared to conventional methods.",SERS diagnostics platform for liquid bioapsy analysis of tumor-associated exosomes,10145619,R01CA241666,"['Antibodies ', ' Architecture ',

"Establishing the Role of Genetic Variation in Vitamin D Regulated Gene Expression in MS Pathogenesis and Severity Project Summary Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disease that destroys the protective myelin sheath surrounding nerve cells, and its cause is unknown. MS prevalence is higher in regions farther from the equator, leading to the hypothesis that sun exposure, and consequently vitamin D exposure, has a protective effect on MS risk. Recent studies utilizing Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis have demonstrated strong evidence for a causal role of low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels in MS pathogenesis; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the association are unknown. It is well established that 25(OH)D signaling operates through the nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR), a ligand-regulated transcription factor. VDRs recognize specific binding sites in DNA, leading to activation or suppression of a target gene. Previous research has found that genetic variation of tagging SNPs (VDR-BVs) within these VDR binding sites, can alter binding affinity. These VDR-BVs are enriched in genomic regions associated with MS, as well as with several other autoimmune diseases, which suggests regulation of specific genes mediated by vitamin D could affect MS risk and severity. No formal investigation of genetic variation of individual VDR-BVs in MS cases and controls has been reported and VDR-BVs are strong candidates to investigate for genetic variation relevant to MS. The overall objective of this F31 application is to estimate the effect of VDR-BVs on MS risk and severity. We hypothesize that genetic variation in VDR-BVs is associated with MS susceptibility and severity, and further, that the effect of this genetic variation on MS is modulated by bioavailability of vitamin D. Our approach will use a dataset of approximately 10,000 clinically definite MS cases and 35,000 controls frequency matched on age and race/ethnicity with whole genome genotypes, demographic, clinical, and environmental exposure data and will: 1) Estimate the association between VDR-BVs near established MS risk loci and MS risk and severity; 2) Estimate the association between VDR-BVs across the human genome and MS risk and severity; and 3) Replicate findings in independent datasets of MS cases and controls and combine replicated associations across all datasets via meta-analysis. VDR-BVs were previously identified through ChIP-seq analysis in Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines and we will use machine learning to prioritize candidate VDR-BVs for Aim 2. Analyses will incorporate a genetic instrumental variable as measure of 25(OH)D bioavailability to test for interaction between VDR-BVs and 25(OH)D bioavailability. Results from the proposed aims will determine whether MS GWAS findings are partially explained by genetic variation in VDR binding affinity, identify genetic risk factors for MS related to vitamin D, and identify new genes and regulatory pathways involved in the development of MS. Ultimately, the goal of this work understand the mechanisms by which vitamin D affects this immune- mediated neurological disorder. Project Narrative Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological disease that results in significant disability and decreased quality of life with both genetic and environmental risk factors. MS prevalence is higher in regions farther from the equator, and recent research has demonstrated evidence supporting a causal role for low vitamin D in MS risk and disease severity. The objective of this F31 fellowship application is to identify and characterize vitamin D binding sites that are associated with susceptibility to MS and disease severity.",Establishing the Role of

"Mass Spectrometry Measurements for Complex PTMs Abstract:  Recombinant protein expression technology has revolutionized human health research, enabling scientists to generate large quantities of protein for small-molecule drug discovery campaigns, for the development of protein-based drugs, and for studying protein structure and function. Yet while researchers are adept at producing proteins with known genetic sequences, they possess entirely inadequate knowledge about the protein's post-translational modifications, both during recombinant expression and when the proteins are isolated from endogenous sources. Alterations in a protein's post-translational modifications can change the protein from an active enzyme to a dead one; they can change a protein-based drug from a life-saving molecule to one that is either ineffective or worse, dangerously immunogenic; these seemingly simple “add- ons” to proteins can be the defining features that determine whether the protein functions as designed or not. Characterizing proteins' PTMs is a necessary prerequisite for identifying disease states, modulating protein binding and function, and producing safe and effective protein-based drugs and vaccines. The long term goals of my research program are to expedite the analysis of post-translational modifications (PTMs) on proteins, to use these analytical tools to answer critical health-related challenges, and to widely distribute the technology. We are pursuing both near-term advancements, such as developing a robust solution to quantifying aberrant disulfide bonds in recombinant proteins, as well as long-range, revolutionary changes in the way proteins are analyzed, by laying the foundational infrastructure needed to bring artificial intelligence solutions to the field of PTM analysis. We will develop and launch these technologies in the context of meaningful biological problems where field advancements cannot be made without information about proteins' PTMs. Solutions in the fields of HIV vaccine design, cancer treatment, and antibody therapy will be targeted first. Project Narrative:  Rapid, precision tools are needed to assess and quantify proteins' post-translational modifications (PTMs); such tools will drive the production of optimal proteins and enable the detection of disease biomarkers. We will make the necessary tools, distribute them widely, and use them to solve key problems in a number of disease contexts.",Mass Spectrometry Measurements for Complex PTMs,10083746,R35GM130354,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Production ', ' Post-Translational Protein Processing ', ' Post-Translational Modification Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Post-Translational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Protein Modification ', ' Posttranslational Modifications ', ' Posttranslational Protein Processing ', ' Protein Modification ', ' Proteins ', ' Recombinant Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Savings ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Technology ', ' Vaccines ', ' HIV vaccine ', ' HIV/AIDS Vaccines ', ' human immunodeficiency virus vaccine ', ' base ', ' Biological ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Protein Binding ', ' bound protein ', ' Measurement ', ' Antibody Therapy ', ' antibody based therapies ', ' antibody treatment ', ' antibody-based therapeutics ', ' antibody-based treatment ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' disulfide bond ', ' protein structure function ', ' immunogenic ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer-directed therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' drug discovery ', ' protein expression ', ' small molecule ', ' Detection ', ' Post Translational Modification Analysis ', ' Protein Analysis ', ' Recombinants ', ' Vaccine Design ', ' protein function ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' analytical tool ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS LAWRENCE,R35,2021,377124,KS-02
"Classifying Oral Lesions with Chip-on-tip Electrical Impedance Sensing ABSTRACT No real-time quantitative devices are clinically used to assess oral lesions during routine examination, making in-clinic diagnostic and longitudinal monitoring challenging. Instead, lesions are evaluated through visual inspection and then histopathological analysis of tissue samples extracted during biopsy. Identifying premalignant and malignant oral lesions early is critical to ensuring effective treatment is provided to patients with malignancies. Oral cancer currently has one of the lowest 5-year survival rates (50% or less) among major cancer types, largely due to the challenges in identifying premalignant and malignant lesions early. Clearly, a real-time in-clinic device able to classify oral lesions as benign, premalignant, or malignant has the potential to provide immediate impact to patient care. Significantly different electrical property signatures have been observed between benign and malignant tissues in a variety of organs, including tongue; since the bioelectrical properties are so dependent on tissue architecture and morphology, we hypothesize that sensing and imaging these properties in the context of oral lesions will enable us to accurately characterize and classify morphologically-different benign, premalignant, and malignant oral lesions. We have developed an endoscopic electrical impedance imaging (EII) device for use in intraoperative surgical margin assessment that we aim to optimize for in-clinic oral lesion assessment. We aim to take the significant step of translating our extensive experience in impedance imaging to develop an oral lesion imaging device that can be deployed safely, and in the clinic, to provide real-time feedback regarding oral lesion classification. We propose constructing a novel chip-on-tip EII probe to sense and image at near microscopic resolution oral lesions in an effort to provide clinicians with real-time, accurate classification of oral lesion pathology that can be used for diagnostic and longitudinal monitoring purposes. The probe will be evaluated on a series of in vivo human oral lesions and compared with histopathological analysis of biopsy samples. The low-cost of a device such as this makes it an ideal technology for low-resource settings and the safety and real-time capabilities of the system make it ideal for continuously following lesions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Visual inspection of oral lesions is not sufficient for accurately classifying lesions as benign, premalignant, or malignant. The electrical properties of oral lesion have the potential to be used as a contrast mechanism to accurately classify oral lesions so that optimal treatment can be provided to patients with malignant lesions. We intend to deploy a novel small field of view chip-on-tip electrical impedance imaging (EII) probe in a cohort of patients with oral lesions to evaluate the efficacy of using EII for oral lesion classification.",Classifying Oral Lesions with Chip-on-tip Electrical Impedance Sensing,10287597,R21DE031095,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Biopsy ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Carcinoma ', ' Epithelial cancer ', ' Malignant Epithelial Neoplasms ', ' Malignant Epithelial Tumors ', ' epithelial carcinoma ', ' Carcinoma in Situ ', ' Intraepithelial Carcinoma ', ' Preinvasive Carcinoma ', ' in situ cancer ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electronics ', ' electronic device ', ' Feedback ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Hand ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hyperplasia ', ' Hyperplastic ', ' Noise ', ' Oral Characters ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' pressure ', ' Ionizing radiation ', ' Ionizing Electromagnetic Radiation ', ' Radiation-Ionizing Total ', ' ionizing output ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Safety ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tongue ', ' Translating ', ' oral lesion ', ' mouth lesion ', ' malignant mouth neoplasm ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Tumor ', ' Malignant Oral Neoplasm ', ' Mouth Cancer ', ' Oral Cancer ', ' malignant mouth tumor ', ' oral cavity cancer ', ' Custom ', ' electric impedance ', ' Electrical Impedance ', ' Impedance ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Malignant ', ' Microscopic ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Lesion ', ' Epithelial ', ' Squamous Cell ', ' soft tissue ', ' Oral cavity ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Mouth ', ' Surgical margins ', ' Visual ', ' Measurement ', ' analog ', ' Morphology ', ' Normal Tissue ', ' Normal tissue morphology ', ' dyscrasia ', ' Dysplasia ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Contralateral ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' extracellular ', ' Oropharynx ', ' Oropharynxs ', ' oral pharyngeal ', ' Oropharyngeal ', ' interest ', ' electrical property ', ' experience ', ' monitoring device ', ' bioelectricity ', ' cohort ', ' Biopsy Sample ', ' Biopsy Specimen ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Device ', ' precancerous ', ' premalignant ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Monitor ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' oral tissue ', ' cost ', ' imaging probe ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' efficacy evaluation ', ' efficacy analysis ', ' efficacy assessment ', ' efficacy examination ', ' evaluate efficacy ', ' examine efficacy ', ' cancer type ', ' Cancerous ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' imaging properties ', ' optimal treatments ', ' optimal therapies ', ' electrical impedance tomography ', ' pressure sensor ', ' ']",NIDCR,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R21,2021,191061,NH-02
"Learning a molecular shape space for the adaptive immune system Project Summary  The adaptive immune system consists of highly diverse B- and T-cell receptors, which can recognize and neutralize a multitude of diverse pathogens. Immune recognition relies on molecular interactions between immune receptors and pathogens, which in turn is determined by the complementarity of their 3D structures and amino acid compositions, i.e., their shapes. Immune shape space has been previously introduced as an abstraction for such molecular recognition to explain how immune repertoires are organized to counter diverse pathogens. However, the relationships between immune receptor sequence, shape, and specificity are very difficult to quantify in practice. We propose to use recent advances in machine learning and the wealth of molecular data to infer an effective shape space, grounded in biophysics of protein interactions. The key is to find a representation of proteins in general, and of immune receptors, in particular, that reflects the relevant biophysical properties that determine a protein receptor’s stability, function, and interaction with pathogens.  Representation learning is a powerful technique in machine learning that uses large amounts of data to infer a reduced representation. Since protein function is closely related to the 3D structure, we will develop novel machine learning methods that use atomic coordinates of a protein structure as input and, through transformations that respect the physical symmetries in the data, learn representations that reflect biophysical properties of proteins and protein-protein interactions. We believe a key innovation in our approach is the analysis of amino acid neighborhoods within 3D protein structures. The distribution of these neighborhoods will reveal how they differ at the surface, in the bulk, and at functionally important regions such as catalytic sites. The learned protein representation will enable us to characterize how specific compositions of amino acid neighborhoods are the building blocks of protein structure and protein function. We will transfer the representation of protein universe to immune receptors to learn the immune shape space. The leaned immune shape space will enable us to address how affinity and specificity are encoded by immune receptors in different cell types. We will study how the modular structure of immune receptors, with separate pathogen engaging and framework regions, enables receptors to diversify and target a multitude of pathogens, without compromising their stability. We will use the complementary aspect of shape recognition to predict the antigenic targets of the immune receptors, and through collaborations, we will experimentally validate our predictions.  Our approach opens a new path towards interpretable computational models of proteins and immune receptors that describe how biological properties and biological function emerge from protein subunits. Additionally, the inferred molecular representations can be used as a generative model, where desired properties, such as antigenic targets, are specified and new proteins can be generated. Project Narrative The adaptive immune system can mount a specific response against a multitude of pathogens, through molecular recognition grounded in complex biophysics of protein-protein interaction. The proposed project aims to develop data-driven approaches to characterize a representation of protein interactions in general, and of immune receptors, in particular. The learned representation reflects the relevant biophysical properties that determine a protein receptor’s stability, and function, and can be used to predict immune recognition and to design novel immune receptors and antibodies against a desired target.",Learning a molecular shape space for the adaptive immune system,10275426,R35GM142795,"['Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Antibodies ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' B blood cells ', ' B cell ', ' B cells ', ' B-Cells ', ' B-cell ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Framework Regions ', ' Learning ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Proteins ', ' T-Cell Receptor ', ' MHC Receptor ', ' Major Histocompatibility Complex Receptor ', ' Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell ', ' Immunologic Receptors ', ' Immunological Receptors ', ' immune receptor ', ' Specificity ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Surface ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Biological ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Collaborations ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' molecular shape ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' Protein Subunits ', ' molecular recognition ', ' Catalytic Core ', ' Catalytic Region ', ' Catalytic Site ', ' Catalytic Subunit ', ' Catalytic Domain ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' protein structures ', ' proteins structure ', ' protein structure ', ' Affinity ', ' Data ', ' Immune Targeting ', ' Molecular ', ' protein function ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' 3-D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3D structure ', ' pathogen ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' biophysical properties ', ' biophysical characteristics ', ' biophysical characterization ', ' biophysical measurement ', ' biophysical parameters ', ' Adaptive Immune System ', ' acquired immune system ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R35,2021,368978,WA-07
"Biology-aware machine learning methods for characterizing microbiome genotype and phenotype PROJECT SUMMARY 1 The Mirarab laboratory designs leading computational methods for answering biological and biomedical ques- 2 tions, focusing on scalability and accuracy. These methods span several areas (e.g., microbiome proﬁling, 3 multiple sequence alignment, and phylogenomics), and a common thread among them is evolutionary mod- 4 eling. The lab has developed scalable and accurate methods for reconstructing evolutionary histories (i.e.,  5 phylogenies) and using these histories in downstream biomedical applications. Reconstructing phylogenies is a  6 fundamental goal and a precursor to many biological analyses. Methods developed by this lab (e.g., ASTRAL) 7 are at the forefronts of modern genome-wide phylogenetics. Moreover, biomedical research increasingly uses 8 evolutionary histories in diverse areas like microbiome analyses, immunology, epidemiology, and comparative 9 genomics. While the lab has previously focused more on inferring species histories, it has recently started 10 to shift its focus to developing methods for microbiome analyses. The inference and the use of evolutionary 11 histories in analyzing environmental microbiome samples present a unique set of challenges. 12 In the next ﬁve years, the Mirarab lab will focus on designing, testing, and applying improved methods for 13 statistical analyses of microbiome data. These methods will target two questions. (i) Proﬁling: What organisms 14 constitute a given sample? (ii) Association: How are samples different in their organismal composition, and 15 how do these differences connect to measurable characteristics of their environment? While both questions 16 have been subject to considerable research, many computational challenges remain, providing an opportunity 17 for better methods to make a signiﬁcant impact. Instead of focusing solely on new algorithms, the lab will 18 also work on building better reference datasets and combining data from multiple sources. Thus, the project 19 aims to harness the unprecedented computational power, large available datasets, and recent advances in 20 machine learning to improve state-of-the-art dramatically. The project will not use off-the-shelf machine learning 21 methods in a black-box fashion. Instead, it develops methods that incorporate biological knowledge (e.g., of the 22 evolutionary relationships) into machine learning methods in a principled biologically-motivated fashion. 23 The lab will pursue several ambitious goals for both proﬁling and association questions. The project will 24 (i) create methods to infer a continuously-updated reference alignment and tree encompassing all sequenced 25 prokaryotic genomes (half a million currently) to be used for proﬁling, (ii) build methods for ultra-sensitive sam- 26 ple proﬁling, (iii) use deep learning to connect data obtained using amplicon sequencing and metagenomics, 27 (iv) build discordance-aware phylogenetic measures of sample differentiation, and (v) develop machine learning 28 methods for associating a proﬁled microbiome to phenotypes of interest such as disease. These new methods 29 will draw on statistics, machine learning, discrete optimization, and high-performance computing. Consistent 30 with the goals of MIRA, the project may explore new unforeseen opportunities if they ﬁt its general goals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite intensive efforts to develop methods for analyzing fast-growing environmentally-sequenced microbiome data, many challenges remain, and there is substantial room for improvements. We will build several methods for building better reference datasets, increasing the accuracy of proﬁling contents of microbiome samples, and ﬁnding associations between changes in the proﬁle and phenotypes of interest. Our publicly available methods will use advanced algorithms, statistics, and state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, but will adopt these techniques to incorporate a deep understanding of the evolutionary processes that shape the microbiome.",Biology-aware machine learning methods for characterizing microbiome genotype and phenotype,10275055,R35GM142725,"['Algorithms ', ' Awareness ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Phenotype ', ' Phylogeny ', ' Research ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Trees ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Sequence Alignment ', ' sequencing alignment ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Immunology ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' high-end computing ', ' High Performance Computing ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Phylogenetic Analysis ', ' Phylogenetics ', ' Update ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' microbiome ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Metagenomics ', ' Functional Metagenomics ', ' comparative ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' microbiome analysis ', ' analyze microbiome ', ' deep learning ', ' multiple data sources ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R35,2021,344669,CA-52
"Discovery and clinical validation of host  biomarkers of disease severity and multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) with Covid-19 ABSTRACT Novel approaches for early and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 associated syndromes and evaluation of clinical severity and outcomes of COVID-19 disease in children are urgently needed. The overarching goal of this grant proposal is to develop clinical assays that can evaluate and predict severity of pediatric COVID-19 disease, ranging from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic to severe manifestations such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). To date, we have collected and biobanked clinical samples from more than 400 patients across 3 academic hospitals, including approximately 100 patients with MIS-C. In the first R61 phase of this project, we will continue to enroll patients with pediatric COVID-19 and MIS-C for sample collection and longitudinal chart review and testing (Aim 1), leverage machine learning to identify diagnostic and prognostic “omics” host biomarkers based on RNA transcriptome profiling from nasal swab and whole blood samples (Aim 2) and cell-free DNA analysis from plasma (Aim 3), and generate predictive models of clinical severity and outcomes by incorporating longitudinal clinical, laboratory, viral, and omics data (Aim 4). Our rationale for including these samples is that they are routinely obtained in hospitals and clinics and permit easy and noninvasive collection without any special processing or handling requirements, which will accelerate the development of omics-based clinical assays. Our Go/No-Go transition milestones for transition to the R33 phase after 2 years include: (1) collection of longitudinal samples from a minimum of 120 patients for each identified presentation (mildly symptomatic outpatient, severely ill in the ICU, and MIS-C) and a comparable number of matched controls, (2) generation of panels of candidate of severity and confirmation of a subset of biomarkers by qPCR, (3) development of classifier models using machine learning using the biomarkers alone (for clinical assay development), and (4) combining these omics biomarkers with additional clinical, viral, and laboratory biomarkers into combined classifier models using machine learning. For the classifier models, the minimum/goal performance requirements would be 70%/>80% sensitivity and 80%/>90% specificity. In the second R33 phase, we propose to develop host-based clinical assays for diagnosis and severity prediction of COVID-19-associated syndromes, including MIS-C, in children from nasal swabs and blood (Aim 5) and validate these biomarker panels as a Laboratory Developed Test (LDT) in a CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments) diagnostic laboratory (Aim 6). These assays will be evaluated for accuracy, precision, reproducibility, limits of detection (LOD), matrix effect, interference, among other performance characteristics. We will work closely with the RADx-rad Data Coordination Center (DCC) on assay development, testing, and validation for submission to the FDA for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) and timely deployment of these assays for clinical use. PROJECT NARRATIVE Novel approaches to accurately diagnose acute pediatric COVID-19 associated diseases, including the Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), as well as predict clinical severity and outcomes, are urgently needed. For this project, we will identify RNA transcriptomic and cell-free DNA omics biomarkers that will be used to develop and validate host-based assays from nasal swab and blood samples, with the goal of regulatory submission for FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).",Discovery and clinical validation of host  biomarkers of disease severity and multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)

"Discovery and characterization of novel ciliopathy protein complexes Abstract Ciliopathies are a collection of debilitating developmental disorders (e.g. Joubert syndrome, Meckel syndrome, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, orofaciodigital syndrome, polycystic kidney disease) which have no cures and limited but expensive treatments. Diagnosis and treatment is complicated due to ciliopathies causing multisystem pathologies and having large variance in their clinical presentations potentially resulting in neural tube defects, orofacial clefting, obesity, polycystic kidneys, retinal degeneration and in some cases, infant death. All ciliopathies are caused by dysfunctional cilia, the microtubule based organelle critical for cell-to-cell signaling, but currently there is limited understanding of the underlying molecular network responsible for proper cilia function. Recently, large-scale proteomic techniques have advanced where it is now possible to query the cell's molecular network and identify many new protein complexes. This proposal describes a research program that will 1) construct a ciliary complex map using proteomic techniques, 2) functionally characterize newly discovered ciliary complexes and 3) identify disruptions in complex assembly due to known ciliopathy mutations. Additional products of the proposed research will include a compendium of proteomic data on ciliated cells, statistical analysis tools for the discovery of protein complexes, functional characterization of critical ciliary processes and a more complete understanding of the underlying molecular network of ciliopathy disease states. This work aims to provide an important perspective of cilia biology in order to better understand the complex etiology and molecular causes of ciliopathies and potentially open new therapeutic avenues. Project Narrative Ciliopathies are a class of debilitating birth defects without known cures and limited but expensive treatments. Currently, we lack understanding of the underlying molecular network in ciliopathy patient cells and know even less about the causes of clinical presentations in ciliopathy patients.

"Unraveling subcellular heterogeneity of molecular coordination by machine learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Recent advances in fluorescence microscopy allow researchers to acquire an unprecedented amount of live cell image data at high spatial and temporal resolutions. However, these images pose a significant challenge for data analyses due to massive subcellular heterogeneity. Although conventional computer vision algorithms have facilitated automatic image analysis, traditional ensemble-averaging of subcellular heterogeneity could lead to the loss of critical mechanistic details. Given the current rapid growth of cell biological data from new technological development, it is nearly impossible to keep up with the data generation if we solely rely on human intelligence for algorithm development and data analysis. Recently, machine learning (ML) is making tremendous progress and has shown that computers can outperform humans in the analysis of complex high dimensional datasets. Conventional ML application in cell biology, however, is usually limited to fixed cells or low spatial resolution setting (single cell resolution), which is limited in analyzing dynamic subcellular information. To fill this voids, we have been developing an ML framework for fluorescence live cell image analyses at the subcellular level. In our previous study, we established the method to deconvolve the subcellular heterogeneity of lamellipodial protrusion from live cell imaging, which identified distinct subcellular protrusion phenotypes with differential drug susceptibility. Thus, our goal is to advance this ML framework and address technical and cell biological challenges in the live cell analysis. The overall goal of our research is two- fold: i) advancing a new ML framework for cell biological research (technological development) and ii) applying our ML framework to integrate mechanobiology and metabolism in cell protrusion (targeted cell biological study). First, we will advance our ML framework for the deconvolution of subcellular heterogeneity of protrusion and molecular coordination in live cells. This method will integrate time-series modeling and ML to deconvolve subcellular molecular coordination. Second, we will develop deep learning based high-throughput fluorescence live cell imaging. This will include microscope automation, resolution enhancement, and data synthesis, which will build up the massive dataset for ML. Third, we will apply our ML framework to study the mechanosensitivity of subcellular bioenergetic status in cell protrusion. We will evaluate how AMPK reacts to mechanical forces and controls the subcellular organization of actin assembly and mitochondria to promote energy-demanding protrusion phenotypes. Our ML framework will bring unprecedented analytical power to cell biology by analyzing a large numbers of individual cells at the high spatial resolution and automatically extracting a multitude of subcellular phenotypes. This framework can be applied to various areas of cell biology such as cytoskeleton, membrane remodeling, and membrane-bound organelles. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to develop a novel machine learning framework for automated, large-scale analyses of single cells at the subcellular level. By integrating time-series modeling and machine learning, this new system will enable us to identify hidden phenotypes and molecular coordination from live cell movies. We will apply the developed technology to study the interplay between mechanical forces and metabolism in cell protrusion.",Unraveling subcellular heterogeneity of molecular coordination by machine learning,10267171,R35GM133725,"['Actins ', ' Algorithms ', ' Automation ', ' Bioenergetics ', ' cell growth ', ' Cellular Expansion ', ' Cellular Growth ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Computers ', ' Cytoskeleton ', ' Cellular Matrix ', ' Cytoskeletal System ', ' intracellular skeleton ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Fluorescence ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methods ', ' Fluorescence Microscopy ', ' Fluorescence Light Microscopy ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Organelles ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Generations ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Microscope ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Individual ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cell biology ', ' Cellular biology ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' single cell analysis ', ' novel ', ' movie ', ' Modeling ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' rapid growth ', ' biological research ', ' temporal measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' live cell imaging ', ' live cell image ', ' live cellular image ', ' live cellular imaging ', ' mechanical force ', ' high dimensionality ', ' deep learning ', ' algorithm development ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' ']",NIGMS,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R35,2021,442500,MA-07
"Quantifying body shape in pediatric clinical research Project Summary/Abstract. Excess adiposity is associated with metabolic changes that significantly increase the risk of developing 13 types of cancer. It is estimated that up to 20% of cancer cases are caused by obesity and that obesity prevention can play a significant role in the reduction of cancer incidence. Among obese adolescents, the most rapid weight gain has been shown to occur between 2 and 6 years of age. Despite clear connections between these factors and obesity risk, the study of obesity in early childhood is limited by the lack of body composition technologies appropriate for this age range. The long term goal of the Shape Up! Keiki is 1) to provide pediatric phenotype descriptors of health derived from detailed body shape scans from high-speed and high depth resolution 3D cameras, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in research and clinical practice. Our approach addresses technology issues that have hindered body composition research in this age range including participants' inability to hold still, follow directions, small body size, and rapid fluid shifts. To develop our body composition models, we will recruit 360 ethnically-diverse children from birth to 5 years stratified by sex and BMI-Z. Our central hypothesis is that optical estimates of body composition suitably represent a 5-compartment (5C) body composition model for studies of adiposity and health in young children and are superior to that of simple anthropometry and demographics. Our specific aims and subaims are as follows: 1) identify the statistical shape descriptors from 3DO scans that best represent 5-compartment body composition in an ethnically-diverse pediatric population, 1(a) identify the relationships that best link 3DO shape descriptors of body subregions (arms, legs, trunk), and matching volumes and body composition measures, 1(b) calibrate automated 3DO anthropometry to clinically relevant girths and lengths, Exploratory) identify accessible combinations of 3DO and TBW that can be calibrated to criterion 5C measures of fat and hydration, 2) identify the factors that define the precision of accessible 3D optical body composition estimates to monitor change in body composition and metabolic health interventions, 3) contrast the association of body shape, 3DO, and 5C criterion body composition to pediatric health indicators including clinically relevant exposures (SES, nursing duration, birth method, nutrition) and development. The rationale for this study is that early life access to accurate body composition data will enable identification of factors that increase obesity, metabolic disease, and cancer risk, and provide a means to target interventions to those that would benefit. The expected outcome is that our findings would be immediately applicable to accessible gaming and imaging sensors found on modern computers. Project Narrative. The proposed research is relevant to public health because they have the potential to provide a better understanding of which young children are at high risk of metabolic consequences of obesity. Thus, the advances proposed are expected to have a high impact to the health and wellbeing of all US citizens because metabolic diseases, such as obesity and its complications, are currently the number one killers of adults, and are becoming epidemic in children as well.

"A visible machine learning system to discover targeted treatment solutions in cancer Project Summary/Abstract Understanding of genetic interactions can lead to therapeutic design for individual cancer patients by targeting the specific genetic vulnerability in the cancer genome. For example, by identifying gene pairs that pose severe fitness defects when knocked out simultaneously (compared to separate knockouts), one can selectively kill cancer cells that harbor loss-of-function mutation in one protein by inhibiting its synthetic-lethal partner. Despite generation of large-scale data delineating the tumor transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, imaging, and so on, little is known regarding how different genes interact with each other and it is unclear how one can design targeted treatments based on the ‘omics data available. To address these challenges, the proposed research will develop a “visible” machine learning framework to systematically understand the higher-order genetic interactions (i.e. di-genic and tri-genic interactions) in cancer and design targeted treatments.  The first step for the proposed framework is to gain a holistic view of cancer pathways through combining the ‘omics data available. Multiple approaches have been applied to integrate data of similar forms, but there yet lacks an effective solution for integrating data of vastly different qualities and formats. To address this challenge, Yue Qin has developed a method to infer a hierarchical cancer cell map capturing cancer pathways at multi- scale resolution by fusing immunofluorescence (IF) imaging data and affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP- MS).  During the F99 phase of the proposed research, by tying the architecture of a deep neural network to the hierarchical cancer cell map, Yue will develop a “visible” neural network (VNN) that can predict the cancer cell fitness from genetic perturbation (i.e. knockouts) and genomic backgrounds (i.e. mutations) while providing mechanistic insights in cancer pathways critical for genotype-phenotype prediction.  During the K00 phase of the award, Yue will develop genetic engineering approaches to experimentally map higher-order genetic interactions in cancer cells based on the mechanistic insights obtained from VNN during genotype-phenotype prediction. The data generated experimentally can directly inspire targeted treatment designs. In addition, the new data can be integrated into the hierarchical cancer cell map to improve accuracy and resolution of the inferred pathways, thus further improving the “visibility” of VNN in genotype-phenotype prediction. The combination of a computational focused training during F99 phase and experimental focused training during K00 phase will fully prepare Yue leading her own interdisciplinary research in cancer biology. In addition, the personalized training plan covering aspects including mentoring and teaching, scientific writing, and oral presentation will ensure Yue acquiring skills necessary for her future establishment as an independent investigator. Project Narrative This project proposes to establish a “visible” machine learning framework that systematically understands and efficiently maps higher-order genetic interactions (i.e. di-genic and tri-genic interactions) in cancer. Investigation of higher-order genetic interactions is critical for designing treatments that precisely target the genetic changes in individual cancer patients.

"UCSF Stanford Endometriosis Center for Discovery, Innovation, Training and Community Engagement ABSTRACT - OVERALL Endometriosis is a chronic, debilitating estrogen-dependent disease wherein tissue similar to the uterine lining (endometrium) is found mainly on pelvic tissues and organs where it causes an inflammatory response, scarring, pelvic pain, and infertility. It affects millions of reproductive age women and severely impacts quality of life and professional life, and has a huge health economic impact of about $69B annually in the U.S. While its etiology is uncertain, profound dysfunction of the innate and adaptive immune systems is associated with inefficient lesion clearance and pelvic and systemic inflammation. The heterogeneity of endometriosis lesions and disease phenotypes is reflected in variable pain symptom presentations, unpredictable fertility potential, uncertain disease pathophysiology, and unpredictable responses to medical therapies, symptom and disease recurrence after surgical resection, and risks for co-morbidities. Clinical classifications of endometriosis are maladapted to the heterogeneity of disease expression, and thus efficient treatments for associated pain symptoms are lacking. Herein, our UCSF Stanford Endometriosis Center for Discovery, Innovation, Training and Community Engagement (“ENACT”) proposes a comprehensive systems biology and precision medicine approach to endometriosis. We propose to study endometriosis unmet needs and challenges through transdisciplinary collaboration and scientific and technologic innovations, integrating multi-omics data to dissect endometriosis disease mechanisms, identify phenotypic and environmental disease signatures, develop accurate disease stratification and diagnosis, and identify novel and repurposed drug classes to ameliorate pain symptoms. To achieve these goals, our Center is comprised of 3 independent and interactive projects and 2 Cores, focused on the central theme of Endometriosis Precision Medicine. Project 1 will focus on underlying immunological mechanisms in endometriosis pathogenesis and pathophysiology. Project 2 will address developing a multi- omic disease classification that will inform diagnostic strategies, and Project 3 will leverage existing and newly generated large-scale omic data to identify and validate new therapeutic interventions.

"Elucidating Effects of Fibrosis on Aged Stem Cells with Dynamic Biomaterials PROJECT SUMMARY  Despite the ubiquitous role of fibrosis in tissue dysfunction arising from aging and disease, no representative in vitro model of the fibrotic microenvironment exists. Fibrosis is characterized by excess extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition that stiffens the cellular microenvironment. Therefore, to model fibrosis in vitro, cell culture substrates that permit quantitative, dynamic tuning of matrix mechanics and composition are necessary. However, existing dynamic hydrogel culture platforms generally rely on chemistries that may be toxic to cells or that simultaneously change multiple parameters, making it difficult to assign causal relationships between altered matrix properties and cell fate changes. Fibrotic stiffening occurs in a wide range of tissues, including skeletal muscle. Along with increased fibrosis, the regenerative function of skeletal muscle decreases with aging. Muscle stem cells (MuSCs) are responsible for maintaining and repairing muscle throughout life and are known to be acutely mechanosensitive, losing their stem cell potential when cultured on stiff substrates. Thus, the stiffened, fibrotic microenvironment may contribute to the diminished regenerative capacity of aged MuSCs. The goal of this project is to develop an in vitro model of tissue fibrosis based on dynamic hydrogel biomaterials and to employ this model to identify molecular mechanisms of MuSC mechanosensing that are implicated in MuSC dysfunction in aging. The mentored phase of this proposal will provide advanced technical training in aging biology, transgenic mouse models, cellular traction force measurement, and machine learning approaches for bioinformatics. This training will enable an independent research program leveraging dynamic biomaterials to deconvolve the complex interactions of mechanical forces, matrix biochemistry, and cell-cell signaling that dictate the progression of aging and disease. Additional structured training in scientific writing, grantsmanship, and research management will facilitate the transition to independence, supported by a committee of faculty from the Stanford Schools of Medicine and Engineering.  Aim 1 will optimize a synthetic hydrogel system that uses near-infrared light and bioorthogonal reactions to dynamically stiffen the gels, mimicking fibrosis. These hydrogels will be used to elucidate mechanisms of mechanosensing in MuSCs, using FRET-based force sensors and transgenic mouse models. Aim 2 will model muscle aging in vitro, using dynamically stiffening gels modified with ECM components characteristic of aging. Single cell RNA sequencing and machine learning bioinformatics approaches will identify unique mechanically regulated drivers of cell fate that reduce MuSC regenerative potential in aging. Aim 3 will develop novel materials for 3D cell culture with dynamic tuning of viscoelastic properties to establish the first human model of muscle “aging in a dish.” This project stands to identify new therapeutic targets to improve muscle function with aging and to develop engineered platforms to study numerous heritable diseases and aging in diverse tissues. PROJECT NARRATIVE Fibrosis, which causes dysfunction and ultimate failure of numerous tissues with aging, is characterized in part by increased tissue stiffness. Despite the profound impact of fibrosis on the health of our aging population, no adequate model system exists to study fibrotic stiffening on individual cells in real-time. This project aims to develop a dynamic material platform that enables user-directed manipulation of stiffness and to apply this system to identify aging-related changes in muscle stem cells that could lead to novel therapies to improve muscle function in aged individuals.",Elucidating Effects of Fibrosis on Aged Stem Cells with Dynamic Biomaterials,10299996,K99AG071738,"['Adhesives ', ' Aging ', '

"Organizational and Cultural Dynamics in Genomics Companies: Industry Engagement in Navigating Social and Ethical Issues This K99/R00 Award is designed to generate scholarship and interventions to guide genomics companies towards more just practices. It does so through a five-year training and research project, which investigates perspectives from members of the genomics industry, and leverages them to inform normative analyses and identify feasible paths towards concrete change. The project addresses issues of price, access and industrial control, with a focus on the ethics of profit and social responsibility. Through the proposed training program, the project prepares the candidate as an independent scholar whose research program links empirical and normative research with practical interventions to positively influence ethics and justice in private sector genomics. The first phase of research (conducted during the K phase, alongside training activities) is a comparative study examining social and cultural factors involved in perceptions of ethical issues among members of industry. The comparative study focuses on three biotech hubs in the US (the Bay Area, San Diego, and Boston), as well as an additional site in South Africa (Cape Town). The South African site helps place investigation of the US industry in light of a shifting global industry, and especially South Africa’s policy focus on genomics for population health (as well as its role in the H3Africa initiative). The study also considers industry subsector and individual company culture, in examining influences on industry approaches to social and ethical issues. During its R phase, the project then involves a systematic normative analysis of profit and social obligation in the genomics industry, based on key theories from bioethics and business ethics. The project will then feed this scholarly analysis back to industry stakeholders; using a Delphi study, it allows members of industry to use results of the normative analysis in strategizing interventions with the greatest likelihood of influencing the genomics industry in ethically desirable ways. This project addresses the NHGRI ELSI research priorities of genomic equity and social justice, as well as genomics and public health. Its career development plan focuses on training in normative analysis and Delphi methods, as well as content training in genomics and entrepreneurship. The training will be conducted at Johns Hopkins University, where the school’s preeminent bioethics center houses world experts in qualitative and quantitative empirical bioethics, alongside the University’s leading research and training in the biomedical sciences and their application in industry. The integrated research and training plan will prepare the candidate as an independent ELSI scholar with a rigorous research program focused on empirical and normative analysis of the business of biomedicine and genomics, and engagement with industry stakeholders. This Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) investigates and leverages perspectives from members of the health-related private sector genomics industry, to develop guidance for improving approaches to social and ethical issues in the industry. It does so through in-depth qualitative analysis (interviews, cases studies, comparative analysis), scholarly normative analysis (drawing on theories from bioethics and business ethics), and a Delphi process of iterative questionnaires with industry stakeholders, aimed at strategizing concrete change regarding social obligations of the industry.

"Estrogen Administration for the Treatment of NASH in Postmenopausal Women PROJECT ABSTRACT Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of liver disease worldwide; progression to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) cirrhosis occurs in a subset of patients and is the second leading indication for liver transplantation in the United States. The factors leading to the development of NAFLD and progression to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), including inflammation and fibrosis, are poorly understood. Moreover, there is a lack of effective therapies for these disorders. Studies in animals and humans suggest that estrogen deficiency may be an important mechanism underlying the development of NAFLD and progression to NASH. However, no prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled studies have examined the impact of estrogen administration on steatosis, inflammation or fibrosis in postmenopausal women with NASH. Our overall hypothesis is that low-dose, transdermal estrogen administration will decrease hepatic fat, inflammation and fibrosis in women with biopsy-proven NASH. Further, we will explore estrogen’s immune and metabolic effects in the liver, including changes at the single-cell level. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that estradiol administration will decrease fibrosis, inflammation and steatosis in women with biopsy-proven NASH. Aim 2 will determine the impact of estrogen on intrahepatic metabolic pathways and on the transcriptional landscape of intrahepatic immune cells. We hypothesize that estrogen will decrease fibrogenesis, decrease hepatic de novo lipogenesis, and increase lipid beta oxidation. These hypotheses will be tested with a rigorously designed, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the effects of low-dose transdermal estrogen replacement therapy in postmenopausal women with NASH. State-of-the-art liver imaging, liver biopsies, whole liver transcriptomics and unbiased single cell RNAseq by SeqWell will be leveraged to investigate these hypotheses. We have assembled a team of investigators with extensive research experience in endocrinology (Dr. Miller), NAFLD (Dr. Corey), liver imaging (Dr. Bredella), and hepatic immunology (Dr. Lauer), which is uniquely positioned to carry out this multi-disciplinary proposal. Elucidating the effects of low-dose, transdermal estrogen administration on liver fibrosis, inflammation and steatosis has the potential to further our understanding of this disease process and identify new therapeutic targets where few currently exist.

"Computational approaches to unravel immune receptor sequencing for cancer immunotherapy PROJECT SUMMARY  The adaptive immune system is responsible for the specific recognition and elimination of antigens originating from infection and disease. It recognizes antigens via an immense array of antigen-binding antibodies (B-cell receptors, BCRs) and T-cell receptors (TCRs), the immune repertoire. Because of the enormous breadth of epitopes recognized by immune repertoires, immune repertoires are extremely diverse and dynamic. Advances in immune receptor sequencing (Rep-seq), such as next generation sequencing, have driven the quantitative and molecular-level profiling of immune repertoires, thereby revealing the high-dimensional complexity of the immune receptor sequence landscape. However, current analysis tools lack the ability to track and examine the dynamic nature of the repertoire across serial time points or to identify the common features across repertoires thoroughly and efficiently. We will develop computationally efficient methods with advanced machine learning techniques, including network analysis, feature selection and classification, and advanced statistical approaches, to interrogate and measure immune repertoire architecture longitudinally, to identify common features across repertoires and to assess their clinical relevance. Network analysis is a powerful approach that can identify TCRs sharing antigen specificity and highly mutable BCR, which can help to develop or improve existing immunotherapeutics and immunodiagnostics. However, network construction is computationally expensive, therefore, we will develop an adaptive subsampling strategy to relieve computation burden. We will implement the proposed methods on two studies to better illustrate the diversity and richness of the data to demonstrate the flexibility and power of the proposed tools. Furthermore, we will develop bioinformatics software by incorporating the proposed methods and techniques to tackle the complexity of the Rep-seq data in a translational fashion and provide a comprehensive platform with user-friendly visualization tools. PROJECT NARRATIVE T cells and B cells as the crucial components of the adaptive immune system.

"Computational Tools to Characterize the Effects of Protein and RNA Variability in Function and Interactions Project Summary  The scientific goals of the funded parent project of this proposal (R35 MIRA for ESI) include the development of global probabilistic and computational models of biomolecules that characterize and quantify the landscape of protein variability and their interactions. The ultimate goal is to elucidate the landscape of functional mutations, which is hidden within the much larger non-functional space. We are using this functional landscape to engineer hybrid transcriptional regulators as well as to predict specificity networks in two-component systems. Another important goal is to devise models to characterize the sequence dependance on protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions. These models will allow us to encode and predict recognition from inferred landscapes and to integrate our results with experimental technologies. Devising the spectrum of functional biomolecular variability sculpted by evolutionary processes will be used to estimate the effects of mutations in disease, antibiotic resistance, biomolecular sensor design and the impact of sequence composition on interaction networks. As the research program of the parent grant benefits from generative modeling and atomistic molecular simulations, we have turned our attention to build a framework that will produce more accurate estimation of the sequence statistics of biomolecules and perform molecular dynamics in an efficient way. For this reason, we request additional funds to build a new Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) system based on NVIDIA A100 technology and large memory CPU nodes. This technology will accelerate the goals of the parent research program in problems related to machine learning, biomolecular simulation and linear algebra calculations.

"Integration of Evolution to Avoid Resistance in Structure Based Drug Design Integration of Evolution to Avoid Resistance in Structure Based Drug Design Many of the most deadly diseases that plague our society evolve quickly, challenging our therapeutic strategies. Drug resistance occurs as a result of this evolution when drug pressure changes the balance of molecular recognition events, selectively weakening inhibitor binding while maintaining the biological function of the therapeutic target. Disrupting the therapeutic target’s activity is necessary but not sufficient to avoid resistance. We hypothesize that the multi-dimensional landscape of resistance evolution can be elucidated through integration of experimental and computational data to reveal the key pathways and coupled molecular mechanisms to resistance. Furthermore, we hypothesize that this strategy can be incorporated into structure-based drug design to evaluate novel inhibitors.  Resistance occurs under gradual and persistent drug pressure, and interestingly the mutations are not limited to the active site of a drug target, but can occur throughout the enzyme to confer high levels of resistance. The molecular mechanism by which this resistance occurs is not clear.

"Multiscale theory of synapse function with model reduction by machine learning Project Summary/Abstract  This project constructs a unifying model that links synaptic morphodynamics, the fundamental process of learning and memory in the brain, to the underlying molecular signaling pathways that regulate it. The motivation for this work is a new class of machine learning methods for multiscale modeling that are a promising candidate for linking the disparate spatial and temporal scales involved, from s calcium events in nano-domains to actin reorganization on the order of minutes across a dendritic spine head. Previously, it has only been possible to study each of these scales in isolation. The project brings together experts in (1) modeling the biochemistry at synapses, (2) modeling the growth of the actin cytoskeleton, and (3) developing the theory and algorithms of multiscale modeling with machine learning. The result of this collaboration will be a milestone model in cellular neuroscience that mechanistically connects calcium signaling in dendritic spines to the growth of the actin cytoskeleton in spine remodeling. Currently, there are few models that can e ectively make predictions about actin structure formation based on changes in calcium in ux into the post-synaptic spine. Since the new data-driven models will be more computationally ecient than exact simulations, it will also be possible to incorporate them into coarse-scale models of synapses used in network simulations and in neuroengineering applications. Additionally, the methods developed in this work an important contribution to modeling in cellular neuroscience, particularly because they are data-driven and therefore widely applicable. Finally, the development of a suite of software tools for multiscale modeling with machine learning will catalyze future collaborations and scienti c developments in the neuroscience community, particularly using models that aim to connect cellular phenomena with mechanisms at sub-second resolution. Such models can potentially bene t the development of pharmaceutical targets for learning de cits associated with aging and neurological disorders such as Alzheimers.

"The Integrated Stress Response in Human Islets During Early T1D ABSTRACT The pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes (T1D) encompasses a spectrum ranging from aggressive autoimmunity toward islet β cells to defects in β-cell function that arise from inflammation. A perspective that has been gaining traction in recent years posits that intracellular signaling pathways arising from the β cell response to inflammation can lead to the production of aberrant proteins that serve as neoantigens that initiate or exacerbate autoimmunity. This perspective has prompted our Team to identify and intervene in intracellular signaling pathways that affect β-cell resilience as T1D progresses from the presymptomatic to symptomatic stages. This proposal takes a multidisciplinary Team Science approach that is responsive to RFA-DK-19-024 to define and intervene in early T1D disease processes affecting human islets. The integrated stress response (ISR) is a cytoprotective process whereby environmental stress signals are transduced intracellularly to activate a host of eIF2α kinases. The phosphorylation of eIF2α halts general mRNA translation initiation in an effort to redirect energy expenditure to mitigate the prevailing stress. The translationally inhibited mRNAs and their associated proteins are sequestered into intracellular stress granules (SGs), the formations of which are thought to divert cellular signaling toward an emergency response. Our preliminary data suggest that the ISR is activated in islets during early T1D, and that the pathway linking membrane-derived lipids to the production of proinflammatory lipid intermediates may trigger the ISR and the formation of SGs. We hypothesize that the activation of the ISR and formation of SGs is an early cellular response initiating β cell stress in T1D that determines cell survival and can be monitored in pre- and early T1D individuals with minimal invasiveness. Our collaborative Team will test this hypothesis through the following aims:  Aim 1: Define the mechanisms of stress granule formation and their fate upon activation of the integrated stress response in human islets.  Aim 2: Determine the molecular events linking lipid metabolism, activation of the ISR, and stress granule formation in human islets.  Aim 3: Identify protein, RNA, and lipid cargo in EVs as putative biomarkers of the human islet integrated stress response and T1D risk.  This application leverages the expertise of 6 Multi-PIs in β-cell biology, lipid and eicosanoid biology, functional genomics, proteomics, computational modeling, and clinical islet studies. The impact of this project will be to deliver new knowledge on an unstudied stress pathway in human islets and to identify and validate biomarker panels that reflect this stress state. PROJECT NARRATIVE Type 1 diabetes is a heterogeneous disorder that results from dysfunction and death of islet β cells. The identification and characterization of new pathways promoting stress in β cells would allow for the institution of defined therapies that protect β cells and their function. This application proposes to study the integrated stress response in human β cells and to identify biomarkers that will collectively reflect the ""signature"" of stressed β cells in type 1 diabetes in humans.",The Integrated Stress Response in Human Islets During Early T1D,10262963,U01DK127786,"['Affect ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Arachidonate 12-Lipoxygenase ', ' 12-Lipoxygenase ', ' Arachidonic Acid 12-Lipoxygenase ', ' Autoimmunity ', ' Autoimmune Status ', ' Biology ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Brittle Diabetes Mellitus ', ' IDDM ', ' Juvenile-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Sudden-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T1 DM ', ' T1 diabetes ', ' T1D ', ' T1DM ', ' Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 1 diabetes ', ' Type I Diabetes Mellitus ', ' insulin dependent diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes mellitus ', ' ketosis prone diabetes ', ' type I diabetes ', ' type one diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Eicosanoids ', ' Energy Metabolism ', ' Energy Expenditure ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Inflammation ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lipids ', ' Membrane Lipids ', ' Cell Membrane Lipids ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Pancreas ', ' Pancreatic ', ' Phospholipase ', ' Lecithinases ', ' Phosphorylation ', ' Protein Phosphorylation ', ' Phosphotransferases ', ' Kinases ', ' Phosphotransferase Gene ', ' Transphosphorylases ', ' Production ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Registries ', ' Ribonucleoproteins ', ' Risk ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Science ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Traction ', ' Translating ', ' Genetic Translation ', ' mRNA Translation ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' stress response ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Collaborations ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' cell biology ', ' Cellular biology ', ' Event ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' fat metabolism ', ' lipid metabolism ', ' cohort ', ' trafficking ', ' Prevention ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Proteomics ', ' functional genomics ', ' diabetes risk ', ' Insulin Cell ', ' Insulin Secreting Cell ', ' β-cell ', ' β-cells ', ' βCell ', ' Beta Cell ', ' Institution ', ' LOX ', ' LOX gene ', ' Defect ', ' Data ', ' Cellular Stress ', ' cell stress ', ' Small Business Technology Transfer Research ', ' STTR ', ' Translation Initiation ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' resilience ', ' islet ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' iPS ', ' iPSC ', ' iPSCs ', ' minimally invasive ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' insulin dependent diabetes mellitus onset ', ' type 1 diabetes onset ', ' Emergency response ', ' biomarker panel ', ' marker panel ', ' small molecule inhibitor ', ' extracellular vesicles ', ' neoantigens ', ' neo-antigen ', ' neo-epitopes ', ' neoepitopes ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' stress granule ', ' stress state ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,U01,2021,768337,IL-01
"Integrative Multi-Scale Systems Analysis of Gene-Expression-Driven Aging Morbidity Project Summary In a well-received preprint, the investigator identified through unbiased analysis of own and published datasets that during aging, and infection of the lung with influenza A, there is a progressive imbalance in the transcript levels encoded by short genes relative to those encoded by long genes. Failure of gene expression homeostasis impacts the rheostatic ability of almost all cellular processes implicated in aging impairing organ function, particularly in response to systemic stress. Transcriptome imbalance could account for manifestations of aging through several potential mechanisms, including: 1) The dysregulation of individual genes, 2) A dysregulation of the stoichiometry of macromolecular complexes, 3) A relative upregulation of short early-response inflammatory genes, 4) A breakdown of the coordination between molecular pathways and processes encoded by genes of different lengths and 5) A reduction in the capacity of protein homeostasis and cell stress responses to respond towards external stimuli by sequestering its activity toward a buffering of transcriptome imbalance. The investigator will test the hypothesis that during aging transcriptome imbalance globally interferes with the functions encoded by the genome and contributes to the loss of resilience in older individuals. To address this fundamental question, he will focus on innovative mammalian ex vivo, in vitro, and in vivo models of age-dependent transcriptome imbalance, and machine-learning approaches. Reflecting the interdisciplinary character, he will work under the supervision of his main mentor Dr. Amaral, a network scientist and data- scientist, and his co-mentor Dr. Morimoto, a molecular biologist studying protein homeostasis and aging. Further marking his transition to independence, he will be mentored by Dr. Budinger, an immunologist studying changes in immune aging, and Dr. McNally, a geneticist and bioinformatician, which is not part of a project grant of his mentors. Aim 1 (K99): To determine whether SFPQ regulates transcriptome imbalance in aging. Aim 2 (K99): To determine whether adaptive changes in proteostasis buffer transcriptome imbalance during aging after influenza A pneumonia. Aim 3 (R00): To causally link transcriptome imbalance to the age-related susceptibility to influenza A pneumonia. Importantly, the investigator’s mentoring committee has a very strong track record of training postdoctoral fellows in transitioning into independent investigators. He will engage in seminars and learn recent experimental techniques, grant writing, bioethics training, and training on running a laboratory, and obtain additional off-site training on the biology of aging in mice with the purpose to facilitate collaborations. Combining the new skills learned during his K99 mentored phase with his prior expertise in data science and transcriptomics will ensure a strong technical foundation to launch an independent laboratory on gene expression homeostasis in aging and the mechanisms underlying multi-system dysfunction. Project Narrative The ability to sustain gene expression homeostasis, is one of the most integral parts of cellular biology but declines with age. In a well-received preprint, the project investigator discovered that most organs of 24 months old mice, and lungs infected with influenza A, display a genome-wide imbalance in the transcript levels encoded by short genes relative to those encoded by long genes.

"Imaging Molecular Level Details of Collagen Fibers by VSFG Microscopy In this proposed project, we plan to fill the knowledge gap of the relationships between microscopic self-assembled structures, collagen-molecule interactions and macroscopic fiber morphologies of type-I collagen, the primary component of most human tissues and a commonly used biomaterial for tissue engineering. By investigating collagen-water and collagen-protein interactions in in vitro systems that mimic basic aspects of physiologically relevant three- dimensional fibrillar tissue architectures, we aim to fill knowledge gaps in fundamental collagen research. We will achieve this goal by developing a hyperspectral imaging technique – vibrational sum frequency generation (VSFG) microscopy – at high repetition rates (400 kHz) and apply it to collagen. The long-term vision is to develop new biophysics methods to reveal molecular-level structures and interactions for pericellular space research and other complex biological environments, and eventually applying it to study various pericellular environment related diseases. In order to correlate spectral features to microscopic and macroscopic structures of type I collagen, we plan to apply machine-learning techniques to analyze our data and extract spectral signatures of collagen’s micro/macrostructures. We will two major scientific focuses: (A) understanding molecular signatures of microscopic self-assembly fibrils structures and its relationship to the macroscopic morphology (plan 1 and 2); and (B) investigating molecular level collagen-molecule interactions (plan 3 and 4). Specific plans include:  1. Obtaining hyperspectral VSFG images of collagen tissues to study their morphology in a  label free and non-invasive manner  2. Establishing molecular spectral signatures of self-assembled collagen fibril structures  3. Understanding collagen-water interaction in first solvation layer of collagen fibers.  4. Imaging spatial locations of chemicals and peptides that interact with collagens. If successful, the significance is that a label free, vibrational mode specific imaging technique specific for pericellular space will be available, which can reveal molecular level insights of collagen structures and its interactions with surrounding molecules, pertinent to fibrosis and cell— pericellular space interaction related diseases. This proposed project contributes to the scope of NIGMS by developing new technology to reveal fundamental molecular-level principle, mechanism and signatures related to morphology of collagen I at both micro- and macroscopic scales, and collagen-molecule interactions, laying foundations for biophysical/biochemical principles for future biomedical applications related to collagens. This proposed development of vibrational sum frequency generation microscopy, in the short term, will spatially resolve collagen tissues with chemical structure and molecular interaction information in a complicated environment. Machine learning and simulation approaches will be employed to build a data base to convert hyperspectral images of collagen into a spatial map with microscopic structures and molecular interaction information. In the long term, the fundamental biochemical knowledge learned from this development will lay foundations for rationally design biomedical approaches to monitor and control pericellular spaces and its interaction with cells, and further advance treatment to diseases related to it.",Imaging Molecular Level Details of Collagen Fibers by VSFG Microscopy,10259748,R35GM138092,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Biocompatible Materials ', ' Biomaterials ', ' biological material ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Collagen ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' In Vitro ', ' Maps ', ' Microscopy ', ' Peptides ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Collagen Type I ', ' Type 1 Collagen ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Generations ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Label ', ' Microscopic ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Biochemical ', ' Chemicals ', ' Chemical Structure ', ' Collagen Fiber ', ' Fiber ', ' insight ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Morphology ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' human tissue ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Location ', ' vibration ', ' bioengineered tissue ', ' engineered tissue ', ' Tissue Engineering ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Collagen Fibril ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' molecular profile ', ' molecular signature ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' NIGMS ', ' National Institute of General Medical Sciences ', ' Sum ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' molecular imaging ', ' molecule imaging ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' self assembly ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' biophysical techniques ', ' biophysical approaches ', ' biophysical methodology ', ' biophysical methods ', ' ']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R35,2021,395000,CA-52
"Understanding the regulation and impact of transposable elements in Vertebrate health and disease Project summary  The overarching goal of my lab is to understand understudied mechanisms of genomic regulation, and how they influence lifelong Vertebrate health and disease. In multi-cellular organisms, diverse cell types are characterized by specific genomic regulation patterns, and the precise control of these patterns is key not only for development, but also for cell/tissue homeostasis in adults. Indeed, loss of fine control in genomic regulation has been linked to disease (e.g. cancer, neurodegeneration) and age-related functional decline. An interesting and understudied family of genomic elements lies in dormant genetic parasites (e.g. transposons, also called “jumping genes”). Although transposons can represent up to 80% of some eukaryotic genomes, they remain critically understudied, since they were historically dismissed as unimportant (i.e. “junk DNA”), and their high copy numbers and repetitive nature pose unique technical challenges. Consistent with their potential impact in health and disease, the ability of cells to suppress transposon activity is disrupted with disease and with aging. In addition, accumulating evidence suggests that many aspects of biology and genomic regulation differ between males and females, including emerging data suggesting potential sex-dimorphism in transposon activity. However, how transposable elements are regulated throughout life in healthy somatic tissues and across biological sexes, and how they influence vertebrate health, remains largely unknown. Thus, we propose to decipher how transposons are controlled in healthy somatic cells (including in male vs. female cells), and how loss of that control could influence Vertebrate health and disease. To explore this question, my group will use a unique combination of ‘omics’ approaches, machine-learning, and experimental validation in animal models. We use two vertebrate models for their respective strengths: the laboratory mouse (e.g. powerful genetics, validated antibodies, etc.) and the African turquoise killifish, a naturally short-lived model organism I have helped develop (e.g. short generation time/lifespan, strain diversity, cost-effectiveness, etc.). First, we will decipher sex-dimorphic regulation of transposon activity, determining the impact of gonadal hormones vs. sex- chromosomes on such regulation. Second, we will use functional genomics to identify new regulators of transposon activity in somatic cells. Finally, we will evaluate the impact of transposon control in key somatic tissues and across sexes on lifelong vertebrate health using the naturally short-lived African turquoise killifish as a model. Ultimately, understanding the fine control of transposon in healthy cells will help devise strategies to prevent their misregulation in disease, by allowing us to maintain youthful and healthy genomic regulation landscapes. 1 Project narrative  Disruption of genomic regulation is accompanied by striking functional changes across cell types and species. However, how mobile genetic elements are regulated throughout life, across biological sexes, and how they influence physiology in response to external or internal cues, remains largely unknown. By leveraging big data and state-of-the-art experimental approaches on vertebrate models including mouse and the emerging African turquoise killifish, the proposed research program will advance our understanding of mobile genetic element control in healthy somatic cells, and shed light on how these elements can influence vertebrate health and disease. 1",Understanding the regulation and impact of transposable elements in Vertebrate health and disease,10265910,R35GM142395,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Aging ', ' Antibodies ', ' Biology ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Cues ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA Transposable Elements ', ' Transposable Elements ', ' Elements ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' male ', ' Laboratory mice ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Parasites ', ' Physiology ', ' Research ', ' Sex Chromosomes ', ' Gonosomes ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Generations ', ' Link ', ' African ', ' Gonadal Hormones ', ' Genetic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' sex dimorphism ', ' sexually dimorphic ', ' sexual dimorphism ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' gene desert ', ' Junk DNA ', ' Somatic Cell ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' functional genomics ', ' Genomics ', ' Jumping Genes ', ' Mobile Genetic Elements ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' functional decline ', ' decline in function ', ' decline in functional status ', ' functional status decline ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' Killifishes ', ' biological sex ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R35,2021,412500,CA-37
"Integration of Evolution to Avoid Resistance in Structure Based Drug Design Integration of Evolution to Avoid Resistance in Structure Based Drug Design Many of the most deadly diseases that plague our society evolve quickly, challenging our therapeutic strategies. Drug resistance occurs as a result of this evolution when drug pressure changes the balance of molecular recognition events, selectively weakening inhibitor binding while maintaining the biological function of the therapeutic target. Disrupting the therapeutic target’s activity is necessary but not sufficient to avoid resistance. We hypothesize that the multi-dimensional landscape of resistance evolution can be elucidated through integration of experimental and computational data to reveal the key pathways and coupled molecular mechanisms to resistance. Furthermore, we hypothesize that this strategy can be incorporated into structure-based drug design to evaluate novel inhibitors.  Resistance occurs under gradual and persistent drug pressure, and interestingly the mutations are not limited to the active site of a drug target, but can occur throughout the enzyme to confer high levels of resistance. The molecular mechanism by which this resistance occurs is not clear. Our aim is to exploit the rich and versatile experimental data, integrating inhibitor potency and crystallographic structures with ensemble dynamics in an internally consistent manner using machine learning to elucidate both the molecular mechanisms of drug resistance and generate predictive models of inhibitor potency.

"Systems Biology of Shape and Size Regulation Abstract The molecular regulation of body shape and size during development and regeneration involves numerous pathways precisely integrated together with the biophysical properties of cellular and tissue dynamics, a complex process poorly understood at the level of whole animals. The overall goal of this project is to gain a mechanistic understanding of the genetic regulation and coordination of large-scale tissue growth by developing and applying a novel integrated systems biology approach. Combining in vivo experiments and their morphological formalization with machine learning of mathematical biophysical models, we will discern the molecular mechanisms that control growth, shape, and size regulation. We will leverage the robustness of the planarian worm to address the molecular and physical mechanisms regulating their extraordinary homeostatic and regenerative capacity to grow, degrow, and regenerate their whole-body shapes and organs from almost any amputation and across one order of magnitude in sizes. This work will develop novel computational systems biology methods and integrate them with whole-body gene expression imaging and surgical and genetic manipulations assays to elucidate the molecular regulators of body shape and size. Morphological, genetic, and surgical data will be formalized with novel mathematical ontologies, which will serve as input to new machine learning methods able to infer mechanistic gene regulatory networks. The regulatory networks will be quantitatively modeled with a novel mathematical continuous approach for whole-body biophysical simulation, including tissue growth, adhesion molecules, and gene regulation. This computational framework combining machine learning with biophysical modeling will be able to discover the mechanisms of growth and shape regulation from large formalized experimental datasets. Novel genetic interactions will be discovered by the machine learning methodology, which predictions in terms of morphological and gene expression outcomes resulting from genetic and surgical manipulations will be validated at the bench via RNAi and in situ hybridization assays. Integrating machine learning, biophysical mathematical modeling, ontological formalizations, and in vivo surgical and molecular assays represents a comprehensive systems biology approach for elucidating the regulation of shape and size. This work will provide a mechanistic understanding of the diverse genetic pathways that regulate tissue growth dynamics and how they interact precisely between them and with tissue biophysics to create and maintain whole-body scale targeted shapes and sizes. This work will pave the way for new applications and novel therapies in human developmental, regenerative, and cancer medicine. Project Narrative The genetic regulation of the shape and size of internal organs and whole body is crucial during development, regeneration, and homeostasis.

"Developing a virtual placenta biobank Project Summary / Abstract The placenta is the first organ to develop and functions as the fetal lung, kidney, gut, skin, immune and endocrine systems. It is the cause of, and reflects changes from, most diseases in pregnancy, yet remains understudied. This career development proposal will train me in the tools and practice of digital pathology, while I apply them to the placenta with the hypothesis that there are reproducible, quantitative changes in the placenta that can be modeled and used to identify abnormalities via artificial intelligence (AI). I will create a publicly available atlas of microscopically normal placentas from throughout the 2nd and 3rd trimesters. Whole slide imaging will be performed on microscopic slides of placentas from the beginning of the 2nd trimester (13 weeks) through post-term (42 weeks). I will lead a team to annotate tissue type, structures, and cells. Algorithms will be trained to replicate the manual annotations. To study the changes in the placenta over time, automated measurements will be performed to identify changes in shape, size, and cellularity of placental structures that correlate with gestational age. This research can be used to develop a model of placental development and study prematurity. I will demonstrate detection of diseases of pregnancy, using preeclampsia (PreE) as an example. Placentas with microscopic changes classically seen in PreE will be scanned and annotated and algorithms trained and tested to identify them. Like many diseases of pregnancy, placental changes in PreE are variable and sometimes absent. Slides from PreE cases with no microscopic abnormalities will be scanned and examined using the quantitative parameters developed for normal placentas, testing the hypothesis that one or more of them will significantly differ between PreE cases and gestational age- matched controls. I am an Assistant Professor of Pathology at Northwestern University with an emerging focus in informatics and machine learning for diseases of pregnancy. The mentor for this project is Lee D.A. Cooper, PhD, an expert in digital pathology and machine learning. The co-mentor is David M. Aronoff, MD, an expert in maternal-child health. Mentor and co-mentor both have a history of NIH funding and graduating mentees to independence. The advisory committee consists of a digital pathology expert (Gutman), a pediatrician (Mestan) and a pathologist physician scientist (Yang). They have proposed an aggressive schedule of one-on-one meetings, coursework, seminars, and scientific meetings to supplement learning by doing the science. Completion of these studies will build my expertise in the application of machine learning to placental pathology while creating a new, publicly- accessible tool for the rapid assessment and understanding of organ structure and function with great potential to improve maternal-child health. Project Narrative The placenta grows over the course of gestation from a single layer of cells to a complex organ that acts as the fetal skin, lung, gut, kidney, immune system, and endocrine system.

"EDAC: ENCODE Data Analysis Center PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project is to catalog all functional elements in the human genome through the integration and analysis of high-throughput data. We propose to continue the ENCODE Data Analysis Center (EDAC, DAC) which will provide support and leadership in analyzing and integrating data from the ENCODE project as well as work closely with other ENCODE groups including the Data Coordination Center. Our proposed DAC team (Zhiping Weng, Mark Gerstein, Manolis Kellis, Roderic Guigo, Rafael Irizarry, X. Shirley Liu, Anshul Kundaje, and William Noble) has expertise across a wide range of fields including transcriptional regulation, epigenetics, evolution, genomics and proteomics, regulatory RNA, biophysics, and computational biology, where they are the leaders in machine learning, statistical genetics, networks, and gene annotation. These investigators also have a history of successfully working collaboratively in large consortia, particularly with other ENCODE groups. Their publication records demonstrate their synergistic approach to producing high-impact science and useful resources that benefit the broader biomedical communities. The proposed DAC will pursue the following four aims: Aim 1. Analyze and integrate data and metadata from a broad range of functional genomics projects; Aim 2. Serve as an informatics resource by supporting the activities of the ENCODE Analysis Working Group; Aim 3. Create high-quality Encyclopedias of DNA elements in the human and mouse genomes; Aim 4. Assess quality and utility of the ENCODE data and provide feedback to NHGRI and the Consortium.

"Assessment of murine retinal acuity ex vivo by machine learning of multielectrode array recordings Project Summary: Darwin Babino, PhD, a trained pharmacologist/electrophysiologist, has spent the last ten years working on several disciplines in the vision sciences. His proposal entitled “Assessment of murine retinal acuity ex vivo by machine learning of multielectrode array recordings” presents his overarching goal to improve vision restoration approaches by developing methods to test the potential of these techniques thereby accelerating the development of effective interventions. Dr. Babino and his primary mentor, Dr. Russell Van Gelder, have assembled a strong team of co-mentors at the University of Washington SOM and collaborators to guide him through the proposed training and research. His previous training will be supplemented with goals to help his development as an independent investigator: 1) Study design and practical learning in performing panretinal (MEA) biological experiments; 2) Fundamental and advanced techniques of the proposed optogenetic and stem-cell restoration techniques; 3) Application of advanced machine learning techniques; 4) Develop leadership and professional skills to establish an independent group. The ability to assess the function of panretinal circuitry will foster our understanding of the advantages and weaknesses of different restoration techniques (Aim 1). The work proposed here will improve an existing retinal acuity assessment tool which combines machine learning techniques on novel, high-density multielectrode array recordings of ganglion cell responses in several mouse models. The utility of this system will be demonstrated in assessing visual potential of the mouse retina in three different approaches to vision restoration that are challenging for in vivo assessment (Aim 2). In collaboration with Dr. Deepak A. Lamba at UCSF, we will apply our system to animals which have undergone stem-cell replacement of retinal cells including photoreceptor cells. An optogenetics approach will also be evaluated in collaboration with Dr. John Flannery at UC Berkeley whose group has developed vectors for expressing rhodopsin and cone opsins in ganglion and bipolar cells. Finally, differences between native and restored vison with small molecule photoswitches, light-activated inhibitors of voltage-gated potassium channels, which confer light-dependent firing on treated cells, will be assessed. The resulting advanced electrophysiology application will help elucidate fundamental questions about the functional retina, mechanisms that lead to retinal degeneration and the potential of several therapeutics for the treatment of retinal diseases. Furthermore, this career development award will facilitate Dr. Babino’s development into an independent investigator by priming an R01 grant application. Project Narrative: Project Narrative: The prevalence of vision loss from retinal degeneration numbers in the millions world-wide and is expected to double by the year 2050, and despite the development of several promising approaches to restore vision in the blind, progress in developing these therapies has been hampered by challenges in analysis of these methods in animal models. We describe a novel system that analyzes, by machine learning, retinal ganglion cell output in native, degenerated and therapeutically treated blind retinas which can characterize the visual information content of the ‘reanimated’ blind retina and thereby facilitate the development of these technologies. The system developed through this grant, as well as the career development pursued by the investigator, will be readily applicable to the assessment of potential retinal acuity restoration by current and novel therapeutic approaches.",Assessment of murine retinal acuity ex vivo by machine learning of multielectrode array recordings,10244896,K99EY031333,"['Aftercare ', ' After Care ', '

"Informatics Tools for Quantitative Digital Pathology Profiling and Integrated Prognostic Modeling PROJECT SUMMARY Accurate biomarker-driven prognostic stratification, response prediction, and cohort enrichment are critical for realizing precision treatment strategies and population health management approaches that optimize quality of life and survival for cancer patients. Genomics holds promise for improving classification and prognostication of malignancies, yet oncology practice continues to rely heavily on immunohistochemistry (IHC) as a fundamental tool due to its practicality and ability to provide protein-level and subcellular localization information. The goal of this proposal is to create an open-source software resource for the quantitative analysis of IHC stained tissues and effective integration of IHC, genomic, and clinical features for cancer classification and prognostication. This proposal builds on our collective experience in computer-assisted analysis of microscopic images (including IHC images), development of machine-learning methods to address the challenges of classification and prognostication with heterogeneous and high-dimensional data, and leadership in collection and large-scale analysis of cancer outcomes involving collaboration with multiple medical centers. This effort for the first time will create tools to integrate quantitative IHC imaging, clinical, and genomic information that will in turn enable the research community to explore strategies for the classification of malignancies and prediction of outcomes. The proposed tools will be developed and extensively validated in close collaboration with clinical, genomic, and digital pathology data from the NCI-supported Lymphoma Epidemiology of Outcomes (LEO) cohort study. The software tools produced by this proposal will enable the characterization of subcellular protein expression in cell nuclei, membranes and cytoplasmic compartments. Spatial features of protein expression heterogeneity, along with patient-level summaries of protein expression will be used to develop machine-learning classifiers for cancer subtypes, using diffuse large b-cell lymphomas as a driving application. Technology for automatic tuning of machine learning algorithms will enable a broad class of clinically and biologically motivated users to utilize these tools in their investigations. We will also provide an interactive dashboard that enables users to integrate genomic and IHC-based features to explore prognostic models of patient survival. These tools will be released and documented under an open-source model, integrated with HistomicsTK (https://histomicstk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and available to the broader cancer research community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Classification of a patient’s cancer is critical for personalizing their therapy, and in many cases involves the pathologic examination of tissues treated with multiple immunohistochemical stains. This process is highly subjective, leading to problems with reliable classification and suboptimal treatment and this proposal is focused on developing software tools to improve the reliability of cancer diagnosis and prognosis. These tools will provide a reliable means of interpreting information derived from a practice known as immunohistochemistry to improve the consistency of diagnosis and patient outcomes.",Informatics

"Resolving Spatiotemporal Determinants of Cell Specification in Corticogenesis with Latent Space Methods Project Summary High-throughput profiling of hundreds of thousands of cells in the central nervous system (CNS) is currently underway. One of the goals of the BRAIN initiative is to build a census of cell types in the CNS, however previous work in single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) has demonstrated that reliance on small collections of marker genes for cell type/state/position classification is insufficient to account for the dynamic nature of and variation in cellular classes/states. Previous work from both myself and others has demonstrated that latent space methods identify low dimensional patterns from high dimensional profiling data can discover molecular drivers of cell types and states in scRNAseq. However, the use of algorithms untethered to biological constraints or not extensively functionally validated can lead to the arbitrary delineation of cell class/state and the trivial designation of “novel” cell types. As proper development of the CNS requires precise regulation and coordination of spatial and temporal cues, the overall objective of this application is to develop analytic and experimental methods that integrate spatiotemporal information with scRNAseq to learn meaningful latent spaces. Specifically, I will 1) generate a comprehensive collection of transcriptional signatures for spatial features of the brain, 2) build dimension reduction software to encode spatial and cell cycle information to account for the highly specific organization of cells in the CNS, 3) derive a statistic, projectionDrivers, that allows for quantification of the gene drivers of differential latent space usage, and 4) define a statistic, proMapR, that will tell you the probability of a cell existing in a particular location in the brain at a given point in time from the cell's transcriptional signature. The ability to define and validate biologically meaningful latent spaces not only enables multiOmic data integration and exploratory analysis of scRNA-seq data via the massive amount of publicly available data, but also lays the groundwork for multimodal data integration—a necessary next step to characterize how individual cells and complex neural circuits interact in both time and space. Resolving Spatiotemporal Determinants of Cell Specification in Corticogenesis with Latent Space Methods Applicant: Genevieve Stein-O’Brien, PhD MHS Proper development of the brain requires precise regulation and coordination of spatiotemporal cues. We hypothesize human genetic variation manifests phenotypic differences by introducing small biases in spatiotemporal determinants that have accumulated effect over development. To test this hypothesis, we build novel computational and experimental tools to resolve transcriptional regulation of anatomical identity (space) and cell cycle length (time) in the brain and apply these tools to induced pluripotent stem cells from ALS patients in a model of brain development to show the effect of genetic background.",Resolving Spatiotemporal Determinants of Cell Specification

"Development of a Machine Learning Model to Integrate Clinical, Laboratory, Sonographic, and Elastographic Data for Noninvasive Liver Tissue Characterization in NAFLD Abstract Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is exceptionally common, with an estimated one hundred million afflicted people in the United States. Detection and risk stratification of this very common disease remains a major challenge. Despite recent advances, including development of numerous therapeutic agents presently in phase 2 and 3 trials, NAFLD remains a silent disease in which the vast majority of patients accumulate progressive liver damage without signs or symptoms and, undiagnosed, receive no medical care. The NAFLD patients at highest risk of cirrhosis are those with moderate or greater liver fibrosis at the time of diagnosis, a group of patients who are described as having high risk non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (hrNASH). The current reference standard for identifying people with hrNASH is liver biopsy, which is expensive, invasive, and limited by interobserver variability. The focus of this project is to develop and validate low cost non-invasive diagnostic technology to diagnose hrNASH. We propose to accomplish this in three Specific Aims. First, we will expand and annotate an existing database of patients with chronic liver disease from 328 subjects to 1,000 subjects, ~40% of whom will have NAFLD. The database will contain ~20,000 images (~10,000 ultrasound elastography images and ~ 10,000 conventional ultrasound images) and multiple demographic and clinical data points for each subject (a total of ~30,000 clinical, laboratory, and demographic data points). We have previously developed advanced image processing techniques to make ultrasound elastography more accurate and less variable. We will use this large database to develop, customize and refine our image processing techniques for NAFLD evaluation (Aim 1), with the goal of improving ultrasound elastography diagnosis of hrNASH. Second, we will combine conventional ultrasound elastography imaging, conventional ultrasound imaging, our advanced image analysis techniques, and the demographic, clinical, and laboratory data in a machine learning model to predict hrNASH and will compare the performance of our predictive model with the FIB4, a widely-used blood test-based prediction rule (Aim 2). Third, we will validate our predictive model in an independent prospective cohort of NAFLD subjects undergoing biopsy for NAFLD risk stratification (Aim 3). We hypothesize that the combination of image processing-enhanced elastography and conventional ultrasound imagery combined with demographic, clinical, and laboratory data will have greater predictive power for hrNASH than clinical or sonographic data alone. The proposed predictive models have the potential to (1) reduce the number of liver biopsies performed for hrNASH detection, (2) facilitate recruitment for clinical trials of NAFLD therapeutics, and (3) improve care quality for the most common liver disease in the United States. Project Narrative In this project, we aim to create low-cost non-invasive technology to diagnose people with high risk non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (hrNASH), a common liver disease that has a high risk of cirrhosis.

"A system for long-term high-resolution 3D tracking of movement kinematics in freely behaving animals PROJECT SUMMARY The aim of this proposal is to deliver an innovative and easy-to-use experimental platform for measuring and quantifying naturalistic behaviors of mammalian animal models used for biomedical research, including rodents and monkeys, across a range of spatial and temporal scales. This will require developing a method for tracking movements freely behaving animals with far higher spatiotemporal resolution and more kinematic detail than currently possible. To overcome the limitations of current technologies, a new solution is proposed that synergistically combines two methods - marker based motion capture and a video- based machine learning approach. First, using marker-based motion capture, the gold standard for 3D tracking in humans, the position of experimental subjects' head, trunk, and limbs will be tracked in 3D with submillimeter precision. An innovative marker design, placement strategy, and post-processing pipeline will ensure an unprecedentedly detailed description of rodent behavior over a large range of timescales. To make the system more efficient, robust, affordable and better suited for high-throughput longitudinal studies, the unprecedentedly rich and large 3D datasets generated by the motion capture experiments will be leveraged to train a deep neural network to predict pose and appendage positions from a set of 1-6 normal video cameras. To best capitalize on the large training datasets, the latest advances in convolutional neural networks for image analysis will be incorporated. Together, these advances will promote generalization of the high-resolution 3D tracking system to a variety of animals and environments, thus establishing a cheap, flexible, and easy-to use kinematic tracking method that can easily be scaled up and adopted by other labs. The large ground-truth datasets will allow the system to be benchmarked and compared against state-of-the art technologies in quantitative and rigorous ways. Preliminary studies have been very positive and suggest large improvements over current methods both when it comes to the range of behaviors that can be tracked and the precision with which they can be measured. Importantly, all new technology will be readily shared with the scientific community, thereby leveraging from this single grant the potential for numerous investigators to dramatically improve the efficiency of their research programs requiring rigorous quantitative descriptions of animal behavior. Narrative We will develop and disseminate innovative new technology for measuring precise 3D kinematics in freely moving animals over long time-periods. Our proposed experimental platform will illuminate how natural behaviors are organized and help us understand how they are controlled by the nervous system, and how this control goes awry in disease. The technological leap made possible by this grant will catalyze a host of studies on the neural mechanisms underlying motor control, learning, and mental disorders, and thus help in the discovery of new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for afflicted patients.",A system for long-term high-resolution 3D tracking of movement kinematics in freely behaving animals,10120068,R01GM136972,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Animal Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Callithrix ', ' Hapale ', ' Marmosets ', ' Short-Tusked Marmoset ', ' Cephalometry ', ' head measurement ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Gold ', ' Grant ', ' Hand ', ' Head ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Intelligence ', ' Learning ', ' Learning Disorders ', ' Lighting ', ' Illumination ', ' Logic ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Methods ', ' Deer Mouse ', ' deermouse ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Monkeys ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Nervous System Physiology ', ' Neurologic function ', ' Neurological function ', ' nervous system function ', ' Patients ', ' Posture ', ' Rattus ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rat ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' skeletal ', ' Neurologic Deficit ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Performance ', ' appendage ', ' computer science ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' kinematic model ', ' kinematics ', ' expectation ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' scale up ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' motor control ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic strategies ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Nervous System control ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' neural network ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' ']",NIGMS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,411071,MA-05
"Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia Spasmodic dysphonia (SD) is isolated focal laryngeal dystonia characterized by selective impairment of voluntary voice control during speech production. Despite well-characterized clinical features of SD, its causes and pathophysiology remain unclear. Consequently, the absence of objective biomarkers of SD leads to diagnostic inaccuracies, while the lack of understanding of neural and molecular targets of SD pathophysiology hinders the development of novel therapeutic opportunities for SD patients. Our long-term goal is to determine the causes and pathophysiology of SD and to develop new diagnostic and treatment options for this disorder. The objective of this application is to identify imaging and genetic biomarkers of SD development and manifestation. Our central hypothesis is that functional and structural brain abnormalities, shaped, in part, by underlying causative genetic factors, exhibit disorder-characteristic features, which can be used as diagnostic and predictive SD biomarkers. Our central hypothesis has been formulated on the bases of our preliminary data. The rationale for the proposed studies is that identification of SD neural and genetic biomarkers would have direct clinical impact by establishing enhanced criteria for accurate differential diagnosis, screening of potential persons at-risk, and evaluation of mechanism-based novel pharmacological and/or surgical therapies for these patients. Using a comprehensive approach of multi-modal neuroimaging, machine learning algorithms, and next-generation DNA sequencing, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) Identify and validate SD phenotype- and genotype-specific neural markers; (2) Establish endophenotypic markers of SD development; and (3) Identify SD gene(s) and their association with neural markers of SD susceptibility. This research is innovative, because it uses a cross-disciplinary approach as a tool for discovery of the mediating neural mechanisms that bridge the gap between the DNA sequence and SD pathophysiology. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to vertically advance and expand the understanding of the mechanistic aspects of brain alterations, identify neural markers and discover SD gene mutations. Ultimately, the results of these studies are expected to establish new knowledge, which will be critical for enhancement of SD clinical management and identification of novel approaches to new treatment options in these patients. The proposed research aims to identify the neural markers and causative genetic factors of spasmodic dysphonia (SD), which is a form of isolated focal dystonia characterized by involuntary spasms in the laryngeal muscles during speech production. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the elucidation of the mechanistic aspects of abnormal brain organization and underlying genetic factors is ultimately expected to have a positive translational impact on establishing the enhanced criteria for improved clinical management of SD, including its detection, accurate diagnosis and treatment. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help reduce the burden of human disability.",Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia,10112878,R01DC011805,"['Affect ', ' Botulinum Toxins ', ' Botulin ', ' Clostridium botulinum Toxins ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communication ', ' Differential Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Dystonia ', ' Muscle Dystonia ', ' Exhibits ', ' Genes ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laryngeal muscle structure ', ' Laryngeal Muscles ', ' larynx muscle ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Production ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Social isolation ', ' Spasm ', ' Hyperkinesia ', ' Hyperkinesis ', ' Hyperkinetic Movements ', ' Muscle Spasm ', ' Muscular Spasm ', ' Speech ', ' Testing ', ' Voice ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Family history of ', ' Family Medical History ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Spastic Dysphonias ', ' Laryngeal dystonia ', ' spasmodic dysphonia ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' genetic etiology ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Deep Brain Stimulation ', ' Hereditary ', ' Inherited ', ' Oral ', ' Parietal ', ' Occupational ', ' Penetrance ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' experience ', ' Gene Alteration ', ' Gene Mutation ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Focal Dystonias ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' symptom management ', ' manage symptom ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' next generation ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' symptomatic improvement ', ' improve symptom ', ' symptom improvement ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' exome sequencing ', ' exome-seq ', ' screening ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' Genetic study ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' imaging genetics ', ' translational impact ', ' DNA sequencing ', ' DNA seq ', ' DNAseq ', ' Injections ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' side effect ', ' ']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY,R01,2021,696730,MA-08
"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways Project Summary  We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated, open access biomolecular pathway database that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by clinicians, geneti- cists, genomics researchers, and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomic studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and disease variant pathways.  Our curators, PhD-level scientists with backgrounds in cell and molecular biology work closely with in- dependent investigators within the community to assemble machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated Reactome pathways currently cover 8930 protein- coding genes (44% of the translated portion of the genome) and ~150 RNA genes. We also offer a network of reliable ‘functional interactions’ (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, which covers an additional 3300 genes, for a combined coverage of roughly 60% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we will: (1) curate new macromolecular entities, clinically significant protein sequence variants and isoforms, and drug-like molecules, and the complexes these entities form, into new reac- tions; (2) supplement normal pathways with alternative pathways targeted to significant diseases and devel- opmental biology; (3) expand and automate our tools for curation, management and community annotation; (4) integrate pathway modeling technologies using probabilistic graphical models and Boolean networks for pathway and network perturbation studies; (5) develop additional compelling software interfaces directed at both computational and lab biologist users; and (6) and improve outreach to bioinformaticians, molecular bi- ologists and clinical researchers.

"Knowledge Management Center for Illuminating the Druggable Genome SUMMARY The understudied protein targets that are the focus of the implementation phase of the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) project need to be placed in the contexts of gene-sets/pathways, drugs/small-molecules, diseases/phenotypes, and cells/tissues. By extending our previous methods, we will impute knowledge about the understudied potential target protein kinases, GPCRs, and ion channels listed in the RFA using machine learning strategies. To establish this classification system, we will organize data from many omics- and literature- based resources into attribute tables where genes are the rows and their attributes are the columns. Examples of such attribute tables include gene or protein expression in cancer cell lines (CCLE) or human tissues (GTEx), changes in expression in response to drug perturbations or single-gene knockdowns (LINCS), regulation by transcription factors based on ChIP-seq data (ENCODE), and phenotypes in mice observed when single genes are knocked out (KOMP). In total, we will process and abstract data from over 100 resources. We will then predict target functions, target association with pathways, small-molecules/drugs that modulate the activity and expression of the target, and target relevance to human disease. To further validate such predictions, we will employ text mining to identify knowledge that corroborates with the data mining predictions, perform molecular docking of predicted small molecules using homology modeling, and seek associations between variants and human diseases by mining electronic medical records (EMR) together with genomic profiling of thousands of patients. In addition, we will develop innovative data visualization tools to allow users to interact with all the collected data, and develop social networking software to build communities centered around proteins/genes/targets as well as biological topics including pathways, cell types, drugs/small-molecules, and diseases. Overall, we will develop an invaluable resource that will accelerate target and drug discovery.

"Modulation of Lung Disease by Genetic/Epigenetic Profiling Project Summary/Abstract Therapeutic management of lung disorders hallmarked by the loss-of-function of the Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) leading to CF are challenged by genetic and epigenetic diversity found in the CF population. Given the Precision Medicine Initiative (All of Us for You (https://allofus.nih.gov/) and the large amount of genomic and phenomic diversity found in patients, it is now generally recognized that we must find new approaches to address the complexity in CF presentation in the clinic. This will require an understanding of fundamental principles dictating disease onset at birth, defined by familial genetic variation, and its progression, influenced by epigenetic programs, both unique to the individual. This proposal is about understanding the role of genetic and epigenetic diversity in CF in response to Histone DeACetylase (HDAC) activity. We have shown these relationships to be responsive to the activity of HDACs, proteins that manage the acetylation/deacetylation balance of the genome and the proteome (the epigenome) to integrate the complex functions linking the genome to the proteome and phenome. Based on the premise that the genome and epigenome are sensitive to manipulation(s) that will favor increased functionality of the CFTR variant fold, the objective of this proposal is to mechanistically define the impact of HDAC modulation on CFTR function observed at the bench and the bedside. We hypothesize that CF can be best understood based on the rationale that disease can be defined by the collective of variation found in the CF population that alters CFTR sequence-to-function-to-structure relationships in the individual as now described using Variation Spatial Profiling (VSP) and the new principle of Spatial CoVariance (SCV) (Wang and Balch, 2018, In press). It is the objective of this proposal to apply VSP/SCV to analysis of the role of the epigenome in CF. Key goals to be achieved in this proposal are to 1) define molecular, cellular and physiological states that 2) describe the role of genetic/epigenetic/proteomic diversity in the CF population to 3) provide a sequence-to-function-to-structure characterization of disease in the individual. Aim 1 will explore the impact of HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) to define, from a biochemical/genetic diversity perspective, how variation across the entire CF population will respond to rebalancing of acetylation/deacetylation dynamics. Aim 2 will focus on the role of HDAC7 in the management of CF genetic diversity using molecular, biochemical and cellular approaches. Aim 3 will analyze the role of select HDAC7-sensitive CFTR interactors to address their role in the management of CF variation from an epigenetic perspective. We hypothesize that the completion of these Aims will describe relationships in the population that define the epigenome-linked genome features that impact progression of CF in the individual. Our integrated genome/epigenome/proteome platform will advance our understanding of the contribution of genetic diversity in the progression and management of CF as a complex disease. Project Narrative CF is a complex loss-of-function disease caused by genetic and epigenetic variation in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR). We will focus on understanding spatial relationships defined by genetic diversity across the CF population that are sensitive to Histone DeACetylase (HDAC) activity to understand the role of the acetylation/deacetylation balance in facilitating function in the individual. We will use a combination of genomic/epigenomic/proteomic approaches based on the principles of Variation Spatial Profiling (VSP) and Spatial CoVariance (SCV) to dissect the role of HDAC in integrated pathways that affect CFTR variant synthesis, folding, trafficking and stability/function at the cell surface that may be responsive to chemical and/or biological manipulation of the epigenome.",Modulation of Lung Disease by Genetic/Epigenetic Profiling,10134401,R01HL095524,"['Acetylation ', ' Affect ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biology ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Cell Death ', ' necrocytosis ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cystic Fibrosis ', ' Mucoviscidosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Biochemical Genetics ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Histone Deacetylase ', ' HDAC ', ' HDAC Proteins ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' disease of the lung ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' Mucous body substance ', ' Mucus ', ' mucous ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Proteins ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator ', ' CFTR ', ' CFTR Protein ', ' cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Biochemical ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Funding ', ' Onset of illness ', ' disease onset ', ' disorder onset ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' success ', ' trafficking ', ' Structure ', ' Cell surface ', ' Proteome ', ' response ', ' Proteomics ', ' Genomics ', ' HDAC7 ', ' mHDAC7 ', ' HDAC7 histone deacetylase ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' Address ', ' Deacetylation ', ' HDAC Agent ', ' HDAC inhibitor ', ' Histone deacetylase inhibition ', ' Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor ', ' Collection ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' epigenomics ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' cystic fibrosis patients ', ' CF patients ', ' individuals with CF ', ' individuals with cystic fibrosis ', ' patients with CF ', ' patients with cystic fibrosis ', ' Population ', ' bench to bedside ', ' bench bed side ', ' bench bedside ', ' bench to bed side ', ' bench to clinic ', ' loss of function ', ' spatial relationship ', ' epigenetic variation ', ' phenome ', ' phenomics ', ' epigenome ', ' Precision Medicine Initiative ', ' epigenetic profiling ', ' Mendelian disorder ', ' Mendelian disease ', ' Mendelian genetic disorder ', ' monogenic disease ', ' monogenic disorder ', ' single-gene disease ', ' single-gene disorder ', ' Gaussian model ', ' Gaussian statistics ', ' Gaussianity ', ' Gaussianity model ', ' genomic platform ', ' healthspan ', ' health-span ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' genetic condition ', ' genetic disorder ', ' ']",NHLBI,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,483750,CA-49

"Gradient biomaterials to investigate niche regulation of hematopoiesis ABSTRACT Replicating the cascade of signals responsible for controlling stem cell behavior remains a critical challenge for biology and medicine. Hematopoiesis is the process where the body’s blood and immune cells are generated from a small number of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). HSC quiescence, self-renewal, and differentiation take place in, and are regulated by, unique regions of the bone marrow termed niches. HSCs are also the functional unit of therapeutic bone marrow transplants following myeloablative therapies. A major goal of the hematology community is to selectively expand HSCs without sacrificing a subpopulation of quiescent, long-term repopulating HSCs required for life-long hematopoiesis. Perivascular niches (PVNs) within the bone marrow are increasingly believed to present a constellation of matrix, biomolecular, and metabolic signals to support HSC expansion and quiescence, however their rarity and complexity can complicate direct in vivo examination. The long-term goal of this Stimulating Hematology Investigation – New Endeavors (SHINE) project is to advance a tissue engineering platform to achieve HSC expansion without exhaustion. In the previous funding period (R01DK099528), we established a tissue engineering ecosystem to examine the coordinated impact of niche- inspired biophysical signals and marrow-derived niche cells on HSC fate. We showed the kinetics of HSC-niche cell crosstalk can be manipulated via biomaterial design to dramatically alter HSC fate decisions. And we developed machine learning tools to identify secretome signals generated by niche-associated MSCs that enhance retention of quiescent HSCs. We build on these findings to investigate the coordinated effect of multicellular crosstalk, cell-mediated extracellular matrix remodeling, and hypoxic stress within the perivascular niche using biomimetic models of marrow sinusoidal vs. arteriolar vascular niches. The overall objective of this project is to define patterns of multicellular signaling and remodeling within an engineered PVN biomaterial in order to identify synthetic niches that promote HSC expansion without exhaustion. To address this goal we will first construct and thoroughly characterize an engineered perivascular niche (Aim 1). We will subsequently resolve patterns of niche remodeling and HSC-PVN crosstalk in response to hypoxia (Aim 2). And we will establish a microdroplet-based artificial marrow niche to encapsulate single murine HSCs in nanoliter-volume hydrogel droplets (Aim 3). Throughout, we will benchmark patterns of in vitro HSC expansion via the gold standard in vivo competitive repopulation assay. This proposed research is unified in our focus to use the well- characterized murine hematopoietic system to develop engineered niche technologies for HSC expansion. Consistent with score-driving criteria of the SHINE program, we will generate innovative tissue engineering infrastructure to define dynamic processes of remodeling and intercellular HSC-niche crosstalk necessary to achieve durable HSC expansion without exhaustion. NARRATIVE The body’s full complement of blood and immune cells are generated from a small number of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in regions of the bone marrow termed niches. Niches provide diverse and dynamic matrix, metabolic, and cell-cell communication signals to regulate HSC stemness. The proposed research will develop and thoroughly characterize a tissue engineering ecosystem to replicate physiological signals within the niche in order to selectively expand HSCs ex vivo for therapeutic and experimental applications.",Gradient biomaterials to investigate niche regulation of hematopoiesis,10413538,R56DK099528,"['arteriole ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biocompatible Materials ', ' Biomaterials ', ' biological material ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biology ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Bone Marrow ', ' Bone Marrow Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Bone Marrow Transplantation ', ' Bone Marrow Grafting ', ' Bone Marrow Transplant ', ' Marrow Transplantation ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Engineering ', ' Extracellular Matrix ', ' Cell-Extracellular Matrix ', ' ECM ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Hematology ', ' Hematopoiesis ', ' Hematopoietic Cellular Control Mechanisms ', ' blood cell formation ', ' Hematopoietic stem cells ', ' Blood Precursor Cell ', ' Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells ', ' blood stem cell ', ' hematopoietic progenitor ', ' hematopoietic stem progenitor cell ', ' hemopoietic progenitor ', ' hemopoietic stem cell ', ' Hematopoietic System ', ' Hematologic Body System ', ' Hematologic Organ System ', ' Hematopoietic Body System ', ' In Vitro ', ' Kinetics ', ' Medicine ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' pressure ', ' Research ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' stem cells ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Mediating ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' base ', ' Encapsulated ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Hypoxia ', ' Hypoxic ', ' Oxygen Deficiency ', ' Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation ', ' HSC transplantation ', ' Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant ', ' Funding ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Metabolic ', ' tool ', ' Marrow ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' exhaustion ', ' Investigation ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Pattern ', ' extracellular ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' nano litre ', ' nanoliter ', ' nanolitre ', ' bioengineered tissue ', ' engineered tissue ', ' Tissue Engineering ', ' Adventitial Cell ', ' Pericapillary Cell ', ' Perivascular Cell ', ' Rouget Cells ', ' Pericytes ', ' Hydrogels ', ' Structure ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Biological Mimetics ', ' Biomimetics ', ' Cell to Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell-Cell Signaling ', ' intercellular communication ', ' Address ', ' in vivo ', ' Process ', ' hematopoietic stem cell fate ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' cell behavior ', ' cellular behavior ', ' self-renewal ', ' self-renew ', ' stemness ', ' Infrastructure ', ' hematopoietic stem cell niche ', ' HSC niche ', ' blood stem cell niche ', ' hematopoietic stem cell expansion ', ' HSC expansion ', ' blood stem cell expansion ', ' hematopoietic stem cell quiescence ', ' HSC quiescence ', ' blood stem cell quiescence ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R56,2021,99847,IL-13

"Role of extracellular matrix in age-related declines of muscle regeneration PROJECT SUMMARY  The capacity for muscle regeneration decreases markedly with aging. While regeneration is led by muscle stem cells (MuSC), complex age-related changes in the skeletal muscle extracellular matrix (ECM) provide potent signals that drive aberrant lineage specification. The complexity of the interactions between aging MuSC and their environmental niche defined by biomechanical, architectural, and dynamic changes in the ECM suggests a data-driven analysis can elucidate underlying mechanisms, increase our fundamental understanding of aging and stem cell biology, and point to novel therapeutic strategies. In this research, -omics data (i.e., single cell RNA-seq and imaging flow cytometry assessments of myogenic markers) obtained from cells cultured onto substrates of varying elasticity and cell-adhesion will be used to probe signaling pathways including mitochondrial/metabolic signaling pathways in cultured MuSCs. We propose that the implementation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) paradigms represents a critical next step for integrating multi- layer -omics datasets and building predictive models that will more comprehensively elucidate stem cell responses to the extrinsic biophysical environment.  The overarching goal of this Supplement is to test the central hypothesis that Biological data and domain knowledge relating to muscle aging can be embedded in a framework of Bayesian optimization will allow for elucidating mechanisms and accurately predicting regenerative responses. This central hypothesis will be tested by conducting three specific aims: Specific Aim 1. To prepare -omics data for ML models: Curate datasets, identify and impute missing data, compile metadata, and pre-process data to quantify descriptors used in model building. Adopt data management protocols associated with best practices. Specific Aim 2. To perform benchmark ML modeling with Bayesian optimization: Identify environmental variables (ECM stiffness and composition, signaling molecules) and cellular characteristics (age, expression markers) that correlate with epigenetic signatures and myogenicity, then develop mechanistic ML models and estimate posterior distributions. Specific Aim 3. To broaden approaches to ML modeling and broaden researcher engagement in the biology of aging: CMU will host a hackathon with teams that combine students and researchers from regional universities and HBCU partners. PROJECT NARRATIVE For elderly individuals, muscle injury often results in dramatic functional declines, with these declines being largely a result of an impaired regenerative response. The focus of the parent grant is to investigate how age- related changes in the biophysical skeletal muscle microenvironment contribute to an impaired muscle stem cell function and defective healing after an acute injury. In this Administrative Supplement, we will extend the aims of this project by developing machine learning/artificial intelligence models that estimate biological age of muscle stem cells and predict regenerative potential.",Role of extracellular matrix in age-related declines of muscle regeneration,10410777,R01AG061005,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Cell Adhesion ', ' Cellular Adhesion ', ' Cultured Cells ', ' Elasticity ', ' Environment ', ' Extracellular Matrix ', ' Cell-Extracellular Matrix ', ' ECM ', ' Flow Cytometry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometries ', ' Flow Cytofluorometry ', ' Flow Microfluorimetry ', ' Flow Microfluorometry ', ' flow cytophotometry ', ' Goals ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Natural regeneration ', ' Regeneration ', ' regenerate ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' stem cells ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' Acute ', ' Biological ', ' Individual ', ' Skeletal Muscle ', ' Voluntary Muscle ', ' Descriptor ', ' Metabolic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' data management ', ' muscle progenitor cell ', ' muscle stem cell ', ' Muscle satellite cell ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Biology of Aging ', ' Data ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Signaling Molecule ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' muscle regeneration ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' functional decline ', ' decline in function ', ' decline in functional status ', ' functional status decline ', ' healing ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Impairment ', ' parent grant ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic strategies ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' stem cell biology ', ' muscle aging ', ' aged muscle ', ' Bayesian Modeling ', ' Bayesian adaptive designs ', ' Bayesian adaptive models ', ' Bayesian belief network ', ' Bayesian belief updating model ', ' Bayesian framework ', ' Bayesian hierarchical model ', ' Bayesian network model ', ' Bayesian nonparametric models ', ' Bayesian spatial data model ', ' Bayesian spatial image models ', ' Bayesian spatial models ', ' Bayesian statistical models ', ' Bayesian tracking algorithms ', ' Regenerative response ', ' regeneration response ', ' model building ', ' hackathon ', ' hack day ', ' hackfest ', ' age-related muscle loss ', ' age associated muscle atrophy ', ' age-associated decline in muscle ', ' age-associated muscle decline ', ' age-associated muscle deterioration ', ' age-associated muscle loss ', ' age-associated muscle wasting ', ' age-related decline in muscle ', ' age-related muscle decline ', ' age-related muscle deterioration ', ' age-related muscle wasting ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' stem cell function ', ' progenitor cell function ', ' regeneration potential ', ' regenerative potential ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,281359,PA-18
"Identifying novel targets for cardioprotection with non-traditional animal models Project Summary/Abstract:  Low-cost sequencing has ushered in a new era of drug discovery that can that utilize genomic information from hundreds of thousands of people. However, humans are a limited resource for identifying novel drug targets, and attempts at therapeutic development often rely on an already well-known set of genes and pathways. Greater potential for discovery exists if we broaden our search throughout the animal kingdom. In particular, animal adaptations for disease resistance have great potential to unearth novel biological pathways to counteract human diseases. Hibernating mammals are an especially rich resource to inspire novel therapeutics as they exhibit numerous transient phenotypes that mirror critical human health problems such as ischemia-reperfusion injury, Alzheimer’s disease, osteoporosis, muscle atrophy, and obesity/diabetes, yet they are able to avoid or reverse pathologies. A systematic understanding of the gene networks utilized to generate the protective and healing phenotypes of hibernators has great potential to reveal novel therapeutic avenues; however, targets that reproduce across independent datasets, including associating with the same phenotype across multiple species have higher likelihood of translating to humans. In this proposal, specifically, we propose to (1) obtain high-throughput phenotypic data to test our platform (2) create a better model for identifying targets based on machine learning and (3) grow our approach into new disease areas. Our long-term vision is to develop a genomics discovery platform centered on hibernating animals for all of the diseases discussed above. We believe that our approach will identify novel therapeutic targets that will translate to humans, and we will advance our discoveries through strategic pharmaceutical partnerships. Project Narrative: Genomic drug discovery leverages data from hundreds of thousands of people, but humans are a limited resource for identifying novel drug targets, and drug developers focus too often on well-known genes and pathways.

"Diversity Candidate Research Supplement to Study Human Cell Models of Aging PROJECT SUMMARY – Overall Since aging is the biggest risk factor of most human diseases and the overall functional decline in individuals, there is great interest in understanding its biological underpinnings, with the ultimate goal of increasing the number of healthy and productive years of human life (i.e., healthspan). Conserved mechanisms of aging and longevity have been identified via investigations into the basic biology of aging. These include studies in model organisms that have also shown that aging is pliable, opening the door for healthspan-promoting interventions. However, a major complicating factor that impedes our understanding of aging and our ability to intervene is the intrinsic and induced heterogeneity of the process. Distinct cell types have intrinsically different aging modalities, and even identical cell types age at different rates depending on physiological context or environmental exposures. These and other cellular heterogeneities (e.g., altered epigenetic states and gene expression) can drive tissue dysfunction and age-related pathology that ultimately impact healthspan and lifespan. Unravelling this complexity experimentally requires application of robust single-cell and imaging approaches to address the heterogeneity of cellular aging head-on, as well as computational and mathematical modelling approaches to illuminate aging networks and pathway interactions that involve known hallmarks of aging. Another major gap in aging research is the need for new and better human cell and tissue models to allow basic research directly relevant to human aging. Thus, the overarching premise of the proposed San Diego Nathan Shock Center (SD-NSC) is to create the requisite infrastructure to facilitate and promote the systematic study of cellular heterogeneity in aging and to provide novel cell and tissue models for basic human aging studies. The SD-NSC will establish cutting-edge Research Resource Cores focused on: 1) novel human cell and organoid models of aging, including from a unique human aging cohort that is annotated for physical and functional measures of biological age, 2) single-cell and high resolution -omics and imaging techniques, and 3) computational modelling of aging networks. The SD-NSC Research Resource Cores will provide scientific services to the NSC Network and the aging research community, and disseminate samples, datasets protocols, and computational tools. These resources will be complemented by a Research Development Core and Center outreach activities that will provide: 1) pilot grants and customized mentoring programs to encourage and support early-stage and established investigators new to aging research, 2) innovative in- person and virtual training in advanced methods and technologies to address cellular heterogeneity, and 3) intellectual leadership through novel programming to encourage collaboration and the dissemination of knowledge related to the basic biology of aging. The SD-NSC will bring together complementary expertise and resources from three renowned San Diego research Institutions with the common goal of understanding the role of cellular heterogeneity in aging to ultimately enable interventions to extend human healthspan. PROJECT NARRATIVE The cells and tissues of the human body age at different rates depending on their precise anatomical location and environment. We currently do not have a full understanding of this “heterogeneity” and how it contributes to overall human aging or the enhanced risk of diseases with age.

"The Nature and Function of Genomic Imprinting in Monoaminergic Neurons Mental illnesses are complex, affected by stressors and metabolic factors and involve changes to multiple behavioral components and decision-making processes. Thousands of genetic variants with small effects are typically involved. Thus, we lack a coherent genetic, cellular and evolutionary model for understanding and modifying important behavioral components affecting decision-making, activity and stress. If such a fundamental model of control could be uncovered for conserved, naturalistic behavior, our capabilities for understanding and therapeutically modifying behavioral disorders would be improved. Foraging has been studied for decades to uncover the basic principles and mechanisms of decision-making. Studies typically use simplified binary choice tests. However, we recently published a naturalistic foraging assay and unsupervised machine-learning methods to study complex, naturalistic decision patterns in mice. We discovered that foraging is composed of reproducible, genetically controlled behavioral sequences that we call “modules”. Using these methods, we investigated roles for maternally and paternally imprinted genes in controlling naturalistic decision patterns in males and females. Canonical imprinting involves complete silencing of one parent’s allele; however, we previously described genes with “noncanonical imprinting effects” that involve parental allele expression biases at the tissue level. We now have evidence that noncanonical imprinting effects at the tissue level involve allele silencing in subpopulations of cells. Moreover, we uncovered important roles for noncanonical imprinting effects in controlling naturalistic foraging and risk-reward-effort decision patterns. Currently, we do not fully understand the behavioral roles for different noncanonical imprinted genes. MEGs (maternally expressed genes) and PEGs (paternally expressed genes) are postulated to have opposing functional roles, suggesting an enticing genetic and evolutionary model of mammalian decision control. Imprinting effects in different cell populations could regulate the form, expression, timing and/or sequential order of different behavioral components of foraging. Therefore, our proposed study tests the hypothesis that noncanonical MEGs and PEGs have opposing effects on discrete behavioral components of naturalistic foraging and their cell-type specific imprinting effects reveal cell populations controlling discrete behaviors. In Aim 1, we will determine how MEGs and PEGs co-expressed with Th (tyrosine hydroxylase) and Ddc (dopa decarboxylase) in monoaminergic brain cells affect naturalistic decisions. In Aim 2, we will define functional links between discrete cell populations with imprinting effects for particular genes and discrete behavioral components of naturalistic foraging and decision patterns. Our proposed study is significant because it will help define an important genetic, cellular and evolutionary model of behavioral and decision control. Our long-term objective is to define a new conserved mechanistic model of control over decision patterns that helps delineate targets for therapeutically modifying human behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will make a substantial contribution towards improving our understanding of the expression and function of imprinted genes in the brain and the genetic and cellular mechanisms controlling complex behavior. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it could lead to improvements in our ability to evaluate genetic risk factors for mental illness according to whether mutations are maternally or paternally derived and uncover therapeutic strategies to help improve behavioral pathologies.",The Nature and Function of Genomic Imprinting in Monoaminergic Neurons,10367506,R01MH109577,"['Exhibits ', ' Fasting ', ' fasted ', ' fasts ', ' Female ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Heterozygote ', ' heterozygosity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Cetacort ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cortef ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortril ', ' Dermacort ', ' Eldecort ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Hytone ', ' Nutracort ', ' Proctocort ', ' Hypothalamic structure ', ' Hypothalamus ', ' hypothalamic ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' male ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Methods ', ' Mutant Strains Mice ', ' mouse mutant ', ' Genetic Models ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Parents ', ' Pathology ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Serotonin ', ' 5-HT ', ' 5-Hydroxytryptamine ', ' 5HT ', ' Enteramine ', ' Hippophaine ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase ', ' Tyrosine Hydroxylase ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' Genomic Imprinting ', ' Genetic Imprinting ', ' Parental Imprinting ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' Reporter ', ' Nature ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavior Control ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' brain cell ', ' stressor ', ' HPA axis ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis ', ' hypothalmus-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' monoamine ', ' novel ', ' offspring ', ' behavioral test ', ' behavior test ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Brain region ', ' Length ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Behavioral ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' Population ', ' Heritability ', ' imprint ', ' paternal imprint ', ' maternal imprint ', ' parental involvement ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' behavioral response ', ' behavior response ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' behavioral phenotyping ', ' behavior phenotype ', ' Dependovirus ', ' Adeno-Associated Viruses ', ' Dependoparvovirus ', ' adeno associated virus group ', ' Adrenal Glands ', ' Adrenals ', ' suprarenal gland ', ' Adrenal Medulla ', ' adrenal gland medulla ', ' Affect ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' DOPA decarboxylase ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Disorders ', ' behavioral disorder ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Catecholamines ', ' Sympathins ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Decision Making ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Epinephrine ', ' Adrenaline ', ' Therapeutic Epinephrine ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2021,762322,UT-02
"Next-generation clinical phenotyping and pathophysiology of laryngeal dystonia and voice tremor PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Laryngeal dystonia (LD) and voice tremor (VT) are hyperkinetic neurological disorders that significantly impair voice and speech production and negatively impact the patient’s quality of life, extending beyond speech motor alterations and often causing occupational disability and life-long social isolation. The standards of clinical care of LD and VT are not established; that is, the differential diagnostic criteria remain vague, leading to a high rate of misdiagnosis, whereas treatment is largely limited to temporary symptom management with botulinum toxin injections into the affected laryngeal muscles. One of the major causes of suboptimal clinical care of these patients is the limited understanding of their distinct clinical characteristics and neural pathophysiology. We propose a multi-institutional, cross-disciplinary Center research program that will focus on the delineation of unique clinical and pathophysiological features of LD and VT in order to establish the fundamental framework for the enhanced clinical management of these disorders, including their accurate diagnosis and disorder-specific therapies. The Center research goals will be accomplished through collaborative clinical research studies at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, Massachusetts General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, and University of Utah, which will include three Center Projects, a Scientific Core that incorporates the Clinical Research and Data Science components, and an Administrative Core that provides an overall organizational infrastructure to the Center activities. The overall Specific Aims of this Center will be (1) Characterization of clinical phenotypes of LD and VT; (2) Understanding disorder-specific neural pathophysiology in LD and VT; (3) Deep brain stimulation in LD and VT, and (4) Machine-learning platforms for differential diagnosis of LD and VT. We expect that our cross-disciplinary and collaborative Center, encompassing the expertise in otolaryngology, speech-language pathology, neurology, neurosurgery, brain and larynx imaging, invasive neurophysiology, and clinical neuroscience and applying complementary multimodal methodologies across these fields, will have a significant positive impact on developing new knowledge about the links between symptomatology and pathophysiology of LD and VT, which will help define the new standards of enhanced clinical care of these disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The overall goals of this Center are to (1) identify integrated features of clinical, behavioral and neural characteristics that reflect overlapping and distinct pathophysiology of laryngeal dystonia and voice tremor, and (2) develop predictive analytics for differential diagnosis of these disorders. This research is relevant to public health because it is expected to advance the understanding of the disorder pathophysiology and help define new approaches for their clinical management. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to NIH’s mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help reduce the burdens of human disability.",Next-generation clinical phenotyping and pathophysiology of laryngeal dystonia and voice tremor,10340118,P50DC019900,"['Affect ', ' Botulinum Toxins ', ' Botulin ', ' Clostridium botulinum Toxins ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' California ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communication ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Differential Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dystonia ', ' Muscle Dystonia ', ' Ear ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' General Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laryngeal muscle structure ', ' Laryngeal Muscles ', ' larynx muscle ', ' Larynx ', ' Laryngeal ', ' Larynx Head and Neck ', ' voice box ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Movement Disorders ', ' Dyskinesia Syndromes ', ' Movement Disorder Syndromes ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurology ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' neurosurgery ', ' Otolaryngology ', ' otorhinolaryngology ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Production ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recommendation ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' San Francisco ', ' Social isolation ', ' Spasm ', ' Hyperkinesia ', ' Hyperkinesis ', ' Hyperkinetic Movements ', ' Muscle Spasm ', ' Muscular Spasm ', ' Speech ', ' Speech Acoustics ', ' Speech-Language Pathology ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Tremor ', ' Universities ', ' Utah ', ' Voice ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Spastic Dysphonias ', ' Laryngeal dystonia ', ' spasmodic dysphonia ', ' Essential Tremor ', ' Benign Essential Tremor ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' programs ', ' Deep Brain Stimulation ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Occupational ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' treatment planning ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' research study ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Stratification ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' symptom management ', ' manage symptom ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' next generation ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Impairment ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' clinical care ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' phenomenological models ', ' phenomenology ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' Data Science ', ' early detection biomarkers ', ' early biomarkers ', ' early detection markers ', ' symptomatology ', ' Injections ', ' Infrastructure ', ' clinical examination ', ' clinical exam ', ' ']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY,P50,2021,2478460,MA-08
"Quantifying heterocellular communication and spatial intratumoral heterogeneity from high dimensional spatial proteomics data The tumor microenvironment (TME) is composed of malignant and non-malignant cells, each contributing to spatial intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) and heterocellular communication altering the composition and architecture of the TME. A high degree of ITH is correlated to metastatic progression and therapeutic response. Previous studies investigating spatial ITH have been limited due to a steep trade-off between cellular resolution, spatial context, and dimensionality of biomarkers. A recent explosion of multi to hyperplexed imaging modalities (e.g., fluorescence imaging, mass-spec imaging) enable the quantiﬁcation of greater than 7 and up to > 100 biomarkers through sequentially multiplexed imaging of 2 to 3 biomarkers using iterative cycles of label-image-dye inactivation. The generation of this new type of data poses both unique opportunities and challenges. There are no state-of-the-art methods for harnessing the complexity of spatial data to infer tumor biology with a high dimensionality of biomarkers. In this project, we will probe the spatial complexity of a TME in hyperplexed immunofluorescence (HxIF) based spatial proteomics colorectal carcinoma (CRC) data (51 biomarkers + DAPI, 356 patient samples) to elucidate the heterocellular communication networks promoting spatial ITH through cellular phenotyping, microdomain extraction, and network biology inference algorithms. We will demonstrate the applicability of our algorithms to cancer types beyond CRC with multiplexed immunofluorescence breast cancer tissue samples  In Aim 1, we will continue to develop unsupervised learning algorithm for cellular phenotypic heterogeneity (LEAPH) to identify specialized, rare, and transitional cell populations. Initial results applying LEAPH on the HxIF CRC data have revealed cellular heterogeneity patterns consistent with CRC literature (STEM cell differentiation, immune evasion, macrophage evolution). We will incorporate machine learning- based methods into LEAPH to measure spatial distribution patterns of each phenotype and correlate them with CRC progression (e.g., recurrence). In Aim 2, we will quantify spatial ITH in greater detail by identifying differentially expressed pair- or group-wise spatial relationships based on outcome data (e.g., recurrence vs no-recurrence within 5 years) to reveal phenotypic domains, microdomains, with prognostic potential. We expect improvement of prognostic power with pair- or group-wise spatial interactions in comparison to the single-phenotype based spatial ITH characterization of Aim 1. In Aim 3, we will dissect the microdomain- specific heterocellular communication dynamics with causal inference network models. We expect to identify emergent signaling networks conferring malignant phenotypes, such as known features from CRC consensus molecular subtypes. The algorithms constructed in this project will be implemented and disseminated through the Tumor Heterogeneity Research Interactive Visualization Environment (THRIVE), an open source tool to assist cancer researchers in interactive hypotheses testing and guiding the design of therapeutic strategies. The recent explosion of next-generation, high-content, high-throughput spatial imaging technologies for intact tissues measuring protein expressions, DNA and RNA probes has attracted the interest of NIH and other international agencies in funding precision medicine efforts (e.g., HTAN, IOTN, HuBMAP, HCA, HPA). The overarching goal of this proposed project is to probe the spatial complexity of the tumor microenvironment in hyperplexed image datasets of tumor samples to elucidate the heterocellular communication networks promoting spatial ITH and related to disease progression through cellular phenotyping, microdomain extraction, and spatial network biology inference algorithms. The algorithms will be disseminated through the Tumor Heterogeneity Research Interactive Visualization Environment (THRIVE), an open source tool to assist cancer researchers in interactive hypotheses testing and guiding the rational design of therapeutic strategies.",Quantifying heterocellular communication and spatial intratumoral heterogeneity from high dimensional spatial proteomics data,10331796,F31CA254332,"['Algorithms ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Biology ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Large Intestine Carcinoma ', ' Colo-rectal Carcinomas ', ' Colorectal Carcinomas ', ' Large Bowel Carcinoma ', ' Communication ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA Probes ', ' DNA Hybridization Probes ', ' Drug resistance ', ' drug resistant ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' Dyes ', ' Coloring Agents ', ' Environment ', ' Evolution ', ' Explosion ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' International Agencies ', ' Isotopes ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' macrophage ', ' Mφ ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' Metastasis ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastatic Lesion ', ' Metastatic Mass ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' RNA Probes ', ' RNA Gene Probes ', ' Metastatic to ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Spatial Distribution ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Immunofluorescence Immunologic ', ' Immunofluorescence ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' tumor progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' Label ', ' Malignant -

"MADIVA  (Multimorbidity in Africa: Digital innovation, visualisation and application) Project summary – MADIVA: Multimorbidity in Africa: Digital innovation, visualisation and application Research Hub Our research hub will develop data science to address the complex interplay, individual and public health challenges, and rising prevalence of multimorbidity in Africans. Epidemiological transition in Africa has greatly changed health risks at both individual and public health levels. Trauma, infectious & non- communicable diseases are major health challenges; multiple occurrences multiply burdens for individuals and communities. The inherent value from the increasingly rich and varied existing data has not been exploited. We have rich longitudinal epidemiological data sets, partial but increasingly available clinical and laboratory records, and genomic data. The data, as is common in the domain, is highly heterogeneous, and in parts, fragmented and incomplete. The Hub will be led by the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg collaborating with the African Population and Health Research Center (Nairobi, Kenya), IBM Research Africa, the South African Population Research Infrastructure Network and Vanderbilt University Medical Center. The initial sites are an urban population in Nairobi, and a rural, transitioning, site in Bushbuckridge, South Africa: each has rich longitudinal data of >100,000 individuals. Although incomplete, clinical records are increasingly being captured digitally. Notably there is genomic data from a subset of individuals at each of the sites. Multimorbidity is inherently multi-factorial — fragmented unlinked data retards solutions. Project 1 focuses on linking. Integrated data sets will aid in understanding these communities, representative of many in Africa, and protocols developed will be applicable elsewhere. A researcher dashboard will allow researchers to find data and plan projects. A clinic dashboard will help clinic managers and health officials to monitor and plan effectively. Project 2 will be solution-oriented to develop novel data science methods to provide actionable insights. We will develop robust methods for risk profiling of individuals and communities using heterogeneous data. We pioneer the use of polygenic risk scores in Africa. Key data science questions are explicability of results and managing high-dimensional data without loss of power. An innovative aspect of our grant will be translational work with public precision health to provide insights into drug dispensing, pharmacogenomics, and behavioral or possible social interventions. The Capacity Development & Pilot Project Core will support a tiered set of pilot projects for African researchers at different career stages, leveraging our strong research platforms and networks. We aim to build capacity in key areas including incubation and cost modelling for data science. The Administrative and Leadership Core will provide the necessary leadership and project management and linking to other DS-I components. The Data Management and Analysis Core will develop protocols for the responsible sharing of data, data quality control, technical support as well as innovate new analysis techniques. The MADIVA Research Hub will develop data science techniques and solutions to tackle the problem of multimorbidity in Africa – the problem of multiple co-occurring diseases significantly adding to the health burden in Africa. Our primary research sites in rural Bushbuckridge, South Africa and urban Nairobi, Kenya each have rich data sets from longitudinal studies collected by the health and demographic surveillance systems based there, together with a nascent set of clinical health records and genomic data. We will develop and apply data science techniques to link the different data sets, build dashboards for different stakeholders and apply new machine learning techniques to automatically stratify populations for risk profiles to different diseases, including the use of polygenic risk scores.","MADIVA  (Multimorbidity in Africa: Digital innovation, visualisation and application)",10314291,U54TW012077,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Africa ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Kenya ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leadership ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality Control ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' South Africa ', ' Technology ', ' Universities ', ' Urban Population ', ' Work ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Rural ', ' Policies ', ' data quality ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' data management ', ' Gene x Environment Interaction ', ' GxE interaction ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' health record ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Pharmacogenomics ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Population-based research ', ' Population-level research ', ' Population Research ', ' Stratification ', ' Subgroup ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' data integration ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Trauma ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' high risk ', ' public health research ', ' population health ', ' epidemiologic data ', ' Epidemiological data ', ' Epidemiology data ', ' data sharing ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' multimorbidity ', ' clinical risk ', ' public health intervention ', ' data visualization ', ' Network Infrastructure ', ' Data Science ', ' South African ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' dashboard ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' population stratification ', ' Precision Health ', ' multidimensional data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' risk prediction model ', ' social interventions ', ' Visualization ', ' heterogenous data ', ' data heterogeneity ', ' data set heterogeneity ', ' dataset heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous data ', ' heterogeneous data sets ', ' heterogeneous datasets ', ' heterogenous data sets ', ' heterogenous datasets ', ' data infrastructure ', ' data standards ', ' data standardization ', ' polygenic risk score ', ' metadata standards ', ' Data Store ', ' ']",FIC,"WITS HEALTH CONSORTIUM (PTY), LTD",U54,2021,1299340,
"Confocal video-mosaicking microscopy to guide surgery of superficially spreading skin cancers 1 FROM PARENT PROJECT R01CA240771  2 Superficially spreading types of skin cancers such as lentigo maligna melanomas (LMMs) and non-melanoma  3 skin cancers (NMSCs) occur mostly on older patients, with diffuse sub-clinical sub-surface spread over large  4 areas and with poorly defined margins that are difficult to detect. To treat these cancers, dermatologists rou-  5 tinely perform a large number of mapping biopsies to determine the spread and margins, followed by surgical  6 excision with wide ""safety"" margins. Not surprisingly, such a ""blind"" approach results in under-sampling of the  7 margins, over-sampling of normal skin, too many false positives and false negatives, and too much loss of  8 normal skin tissue. What may help address this problem is reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) imaging to  9 noninvasively delineate margins, directly on patients. RCM imaging detects skin cancers in vivo with sensitivity 10 of 85-95% and specificity 80-70%. In 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services granted reim- 11 bursement codes for RCM imaging of skin. RCM imaging is now being increasingly used to noninvasively 12 guide diagnosis, sparing patients from biopsies of benign lesions. While the two-decade effort to date was fo- 13 cused on imaging-guided diagnosis, emerging applications are in imaging to guide therapy. We propose to 14 create an approach called RCM video-mosaicking, to noninvasively map skin cancer margins over large areas 15 on patients, with increased sampling, accuracy and sparing of normal tissue. The parent project specific aims 16 are (1) to develop a real-time and robust RCM video-mosaicking approach and incorporate into a handheld 17 confocal microscope for use at the bedside, (2) to test the approach for image quality and clinical acceptability, 18 and (3) to prospectively test on 100 patients, with video-mosaicking of LMM margins and superficial NMSC 19 margins, followed by validation against post-surgical pathology. 20 PROPOSED DIVERSITY SUPPLEMENT PROJECT FOR Ms. ANABEL ALFONSO 21 The proposed project for Ms. Anabel Alfonso will build upon the parent project and extend it in a completely 22 novel direction. In the parent project, RCM video-mosaics will be visually read by Mohs surgeons during sur- 23 gery. The innovation in Anabel’s project will be the development of a new machine learning-based algorithm 24 for automated detection and mapping of LMM margins in video-mosaics, toward automating, standardizing and 25 increasing the speed and efficiency of video-mosaicking for Mohs surgeons at the bedside. The specific aims 26 for Anabel’s project are to (1) develop an image classification and segmentation algorithm that automatically 27 analyzes RCM video-mosaics, highlights diagnostically significant areas (malignant versus normal) in LMM 28 margins and provides real-time diagnostic feedback to Mohs surgeons; (2) to test and validate the algorithm on 29 RCM videos and video-mosaics obtained from LMMs on 50 patients. Acquisition of the videos and video- 30 mosaics will occur during the parent project. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH SAME AS PARENT PROJECT R01CA240771 Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) imaging can noninvasively diagnose skin cancers and spare patients from biopsies of benign skin conditions. We will develop an approach to noninvasively map skin cancer margins, to help guide less invasive surgery, and help more accurately and completely remove cancer while preserving more of the surrounding normal skin.",Confocal video-mosaicking microscopy to guide surgery of superficially spreading skin cancers,10309506,R01CA240771,"['Algorithms ', ' Biopsy ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Skin Cancer ', ' Malignant Skin Neoplasm ', ' malignant skin tumor ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Feedback ', ' Grant ', ' Hybrids ', ' Learning ', ' Maps ', ' Microscopy ', ' Mosaicism ', ' mosaic disorders ', ' Motion ', ' Noise ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Surgical Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Safety ', ' Specificity ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Universities ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', "" Hutchinson's Melanotic Freckle "", ' Lentigo Maligna ', ' Lentigo Maligna Melanoma ', ' Malignant Lentigo ', ' Malignant Lentigo Melanoma ', ' Melanotic Freckle ', ' base ', ' Microscope ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Malignant ', ' Lesion ', ' Visual ', ' Video Microscopy ', ' Videomicrography ', ' Videomicroscopy ', ' Dermatologist ', ' noninvasive diagnosis ', ' non-invasive diagnosis ', ' non-invasive diagnostic ', ' noninvasive diagnostic ', ' Collaborations ', ' Normal Tissue ', ' Normal tissue morphology ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Surgeon ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' cutaneous tissue ', ' Skin Tissue ', ' Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer ', ' nonmelanoma skin cancer ', ' Skin Carcinoma ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Skin ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Address ', ' Detection ', ' MSKCC ', ' Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' blind ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' parent project ', ' image guided ', ' image guidance ', ' learning network ', ' microscopic imaging ', ' microscope imaging ', ' microscopy imaging ', ' prospective test ', ' clinical imaging ', ' reflectance confocal microscopy ', ' in vivo confocal microscopy ', ' imaging approach ', ' imaging based approach ', ' preservation ', ' deep learning ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' classification algorithm ', ' segmentation algorithm ', ' automated algorithm ', ' automatic algorithm ', ' ']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2021,81243,NY-12
"Mentoring and Research to Classify  Atrial Cardiomyopathy This K24 grant will provide the PI, Dr. Lin Yee Chen, a midcareer NIH-funded patient-oriented research (POR) investigator, with the protected time and support needed to (1) accelerate his current trajectory in mentoring junior clinicians and investigators who are conducting POR in cardiovascular (CV) science, (2) acquire additional training in mentoring methods, machine learning, and omics science, (3) promote his current research that aims to define the mechanisms underlying the relationship of the abnormal atrial substrate—atrial cardiomyopathy—and atrial fibrillation (AF) to ischemic stroke and other CV outcomes. Trainees in his AF Clinical Research Group will be recruited from the NIH-funded T32 training programs in the University of Minnesota's Division of Cardiology, Division of Epidemiology, and Division of Biostatistics; Department of Medicine Physician Scientist Training Program; KL2 and TL1 Programs of the CTSI; and graduate programs (MS in Clinical Research, MPH, and PhD) in the School of Public Health. For his career development, Dr. Chen will hone his mentoring skills and learn new skills in cutting-edge areas (machine learning and omics science) through focused study, selected coursework, seminars, and guidance from senior collaborators with domain expertise. Finally, this grant will support a research project that is based on the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, which extends Dr. Chen’s ongoing work to elucidate the role of atrial cardiomyopathy in driving AF-related outcomes. The specific aims are: (1) Identify atrial cardiomyopathy subtypes by using machine learning approaches to analyze the extensive data at ARIC Visit 5 (2011-13): clinical, 2D-echocardiographic, heart rate variability, arterial stiffness, ECG, and multi-omics data, (2) Evaluate association of subtypes with ischemic stroke and other CV outcomes, and (3) Discover specific risk factors for subtypes by analyzing risk factor measures collected at Visits 1-4 (1987-98). Crucially, findings will be validated in 2 independent community-based cohorts: Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) and Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). This project has significant impact: (1) This K24 grant will provide the PI with the protected time to enhance his current mentoring of trainees involved in POR. By assembling a team of senior collaborators that comprise experts in mentoring, data science, and molecular epidemiology, the PI provides an outstanding platform for his mentees to acquire cutting-edge skills in POR, (2) By resolving heterogeneity in atrial cardiomyopathy, the team will advance the NIH’s Precision Medicine initiative by personalizing current treatment for patients based on biological underpinnings, (3) The findings will lead to a clinically meaningful improvement in classification of stroke risk in patients with AF, which will improve patient outcomes, (4) By efficiently leveraging existing resources of deeply phenotyped NHLBI cohorts, this project will fill critical knowledge gaps in prevention and treatment, thus achieving a sustained and powerful impact on CV public health, clinical practice, and education of the next generation of researchers in POR. The abnormal atrial substrate (atrial cardiomyopathy) is associated with elevated risks of ischemic stroke dementia, and other cardiovascular outcomes, such as heart failure. Progress in preventing these adverse outcomes has been hampered by unresolved heterogeneity underlying atrial cardiomyopathy; hence, this K24 grant will support a project that will use machine learning and dense phenotypic data to identify clinically relevant subtypes of atrial cardiomyopathy. Additionally, this K24 grant will foster a supportive environment for the mentoring of junior investigators involved in patient-oriented research and facilitate acquisition of new cutting-edge skills by the PI and his mentees.",Mentoring and Research to Classify  Atrial Cardiomyopathy,10307378,K24HL155813,"['Aging ', ' Anticoagulants ', ' Anticoagulant Agents ', ' Anticoagulant Drugs ', ' blood thinner ', ' thrombopoiesis inhibitor ', ' Anticoagulation ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Cardiology ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' ECG ', ' EKG ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Heart Atrium ', ' Atrial ', ' Cardiac Atrium ', ' atrium ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Learning ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Minnesota ', ' Morbidity -

"Development of a pipeline for parallel elucidation of protein structures Advances in biophysical technologies have accelerated our ability to probe the mechanisms of even the most complex cellular systems, and such studies have enabled researchers to design modifications to known protein structures and design completely new proteins. This “protein design” technology has given rise to an ability to manipulate protein structures as a means of improving on or introducing new medical diagnostics and therapeutics. The bases of these studies rely on computational modeling of protein candidates, although the accuracy of protein structure prediction, protein de novo design, and single-mutation effects prediction remain below the threshold for many use cases, such as structure-guided drug design and rational enzyme engineering. Thus, success of a protein engineering effort relies on high-resolution structure determination, which involves laborious screening and optimization in order to obtain stable proteins or active enzyme variants. However, our ability to observe protein structure using common structure determination strategies (X-ray crystallography, NMR, and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM)) lags far behind our ability to design and produce new sequences, creating a knowledge gap that prevents biochemists from accessing the range of protein functions seen in nature. While current technologies enable rapid synthesis of hundreds of proteins with varied sequences, there do not exist technologies for rapid structural characterization of these generated proteins. The ability to obtain high- resolution structural information for hundreds of sequences in parallel would provide invaluable insights in protein engineering methods. Importantly, rapid structure determination would enable structural characterization of genetic variation in the human genome underlying disease by enabling the structural and mechanistic interpretation of rare and de novo disease-related variants. Cryo-EM enables numerous high-resolution structures to be determined from a small amount of sample without requiring homogeneity, an aspect of this method that we plan to exploit for parallel elucidation of protein structures. We will establish the feasibility of this technique for rapidly investigate the structures of engineered protein libraries, where the molecular weight range is near or below the lower detection limit of cryo-EM. We will also probe the limits of our ability to identify the location and structural impact of tested mutations at limited structural locations, such as active sites. We will explore the feasibility of our parallel structure determination approach in two aims: Aim 1 will identify the limit of current single-particle analysis methods to discriminate between structurally similar protein complexes. Aim 2 will implement machine learning algorithms to push the current limits of classification using a combination of synthetic and real data. These exploratory studies will pave the way to rapid structure determination of multiple protein complexes from a single cryo-EM experiment, providing the ability to rapidly obtain high-resolution structures for many engineered proteins, thereby enabling unprecedented design and testing feedback cycles to help treat human disease. Narrative Our understanding of structure-function relationships has matured to the point that we can now manipulate the composition of proteins as a means of producing diagnostics or therapeutics for human disease. However, in order to fully elucidate the biochemical mechanisms of function that drive these protein design studies, structures of the designed proteins must be determined. However, structure determination is a massive bottleneck, which we plan to overcome by establishing a platform for massively parallelized structure determination of protein targets that is commensurate with the rate of protein production involved in protein design studies.",Development of a pipeline for parallel elucidation of protein structures,10231713,R21GM142196,"['Amino Acid Sequence ', ' Primary Protein Structure ', ' protein sequence ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Crystallography ', ' Crystallographies ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug Design ', ' Engineering ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Heart ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Libraries ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Structural Models ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' Molecular Weight ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Names ', ' Production ', ' Protein Engineering ', ' genetic protein engineering ', ' protein design ', ' Proteins ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Structure-Activity Relationship ', ' chemical structure function ', ' structure function relationship ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' protein folding ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Medical ', ' Active Sites ', ' X-Ray Crystallography ', ' Single Crystal Diffraction ', ' X Ray Crystallographies ', ' X-Ray Diffraction Crystallography ', ' X-Ray/Neutron Crystallography ', ' Xray Crystallography ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' particle ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Cryo-electron Microscopy ', ' Electron Cryomicroscopy ', ' cryo-EM ', ' cryoEM ', ' Cryoelectron Microscopy ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Structure ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' Proteomics ', ' rapid method ', ' rapid technique ', ' protein complex ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' genome sequencing ', ' protein structures ', ' proteins structure ', ' protein structure ', ' Biochemical Process ', ' Data ', ' Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Protein Biochemistry ', ' Resolution ', ' Preparation ', ' Modification ', ' protein function ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' protein structure prediction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' human disease ', ' therapeutic development ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' screening ', ' variant of unknown significance ', ' unclassified variant ', ' variant of uncertain clinical significance ', ' variant of uncertain significance ', ' variant of undetermined significance ', ' Structural Protein ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' deep learning ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' classification algorithm ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' in silico ', ' de novo mutation ', ' de novo variant ', ' detection limit ', ' ']",NIGMS,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R21,2021,221875,CA-49

"Leveraging a Natural Experiment to Estimate the Effects of School Racial Segregation on Cardiovascular Risk Factors among Youth and Young Adults ABSTRACT  Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors disproportionately affect black adults, and these disparities are evident early in the life course. Genetic factors do not appear to explain this difference, and studies have increasingly implicated socioeconomic risk factors. Among the most prominent risk factors for racial disparities in CVD is educational attainment, which is strongly correlated with smoking, hypertension, and CVD over the life course. Yet it is unclear which aspects of schooling are most salient. One possible explanation for racial disparities in CVD is that black youth often attend highly racially segregated schools. Segregation is thought to be linked with CVD due to increased stress and discrimination; social norms and peer influence; and the constraining of socioeconomic opportunities that reduces income and healthcare access later in life. Yet despite the fact that school segregation has increased in recent years, there are no studies examining the effects of recent school segregation trends on CVD risk factors. The goal of this study is to provide this urgently needed evidence. In particular, we take advantage of a unique natural experiment, overcoming methodological challenges in the previous literature on the effects of education on CVD. Since 1990, numerous local court decisions have resulted in “resegregation” in school districts across the country. We link nationwide data on these court decisions and school district-level measures of school segregation with CVD outcome data from two large nationally representative U.S. cohort studies of affected youth: the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health, N≈90,000) and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (N≈8,000). We employ the quasi-experimental technique of instrumental variables analysis, which reduces typical confounding by factors such as unobserved individual and family characteristics. In Aim 1, our goal is to estimate the short- term effects of school segregation on CVD risk factors—including smoking, physical activity, obesity, and mental health—among youth while they are still in school. In Aim 2, we will examine the long-term effects of school segregation in the decades that follow, with outcomes including those in Aim 1 in addition to objectively measured CVD biomarkers, diabetes, and hypertension. We will also undertake exploratory analyses to determine possible mediating pathways. In Aim 3, we will identify vulnerable subgroups whose development of CVD risk factors differs in response to school racial segregation. This will enable future interventions to be tailored to the most vulnerable individuals. We will employ both hypothesis-driven and hypothesis-generating statistical techniques, including innovative machine learning methods that allow for more complex and robust subgroup identification. Overall, the expected outcome of this research is to produce rigorous evidence on the effects of school racial segregation on CVD risk factors, helping to inform school-based, clinical, and community interventions to reduce persistent and inequitable racial disparities in CVD. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The goal of this research is to examine the short-term and long-term effects of school racial segregation on risk factors for heart disease. We will also assess whether specific subgroups may be more vulnerable to school segregation. This will inform the development of public health programs and school-based interventions to address black-white disparities in heart disease.",Leveraging a Natural Experiment to Estimate the Effects

"Leveraging biomarkers for personalized treatment of alcohol use disorder comorbid with PTSD Overall Summary The overarching goal of the proposed center is to leverage molecular and circuit biomarkers to advance the understanding of mechanisms and personalized treatment of topiramate treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder comorbid with PTSD. We propose an integrative translational focus on alterations in excitatory and inhibitory signaling, focusing on GABA and glutamate and related circuitry, to model the neurobiology of PTSD comorbid with PTSD and the mitigating effects of topiramate. We will characterize excitatory and inhibitory molecular markers in an animal model of AUD comorbid with PTSD, utilizing genomic markers in the brain and plasma markers in rodents. In clinical trial participants we will characterize excitatory and inhibitory neuronal signaling by ascertaining plasma markers, GRIK 1 genotype and neural circuit markers utilizing TMS evoked potentials in EEG, task-based functional MRI and MR spectroscopy. This goal will be achieved through the activities of three research projects supported by two research cores, the administrative core and the Scientific Advisory Board (Figure1). In Project 1 lead by Silvia Fossati Ph.D. and Jorge Manzanares Robles Ph.D. we will study the behavioral and molecular effects of two doses of topiramate vs. vehicle in animal models of AUD alone, PTSD alone and AUD+PTSD. In Project 2 lead by Michael Bogenschutz M.D. and Joshua Lee M.D. we will study the behavioral, genetic and plasma biomarker effects of topiramate vs. placebo in 150 participants with co-occurring AUD and PTSD. In project 3 lead by Amit Etkin M.D., Ph.D. and Charles R. Marmar M.D. we will ascertain multi-modal imaging markers including task based fMRI, TMS evoked potentials in EEG and MRS. Imaging markers will be used to characterize excitatory and inhibitory circuits in Project 2 clinical trial participants with AUD+PTSD to determine predictors and mechanisms of topiramate vs. placebo treatment outcomes. Plasma biomarkers in Project 2 will be related to the same or homologous plasma biomarkers in Project 1. Circuit markers from Project 3 will be related to genomic markers in the same or homologous brain regions in Project 1. The Biofluids Biomarker Core (BBC) lead by Dr. Fossati will support collection of plasma biomarkers (GABA, glutamate, HPA axis, neuropeptides, neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress) in animals in Project 1 and clinical trial participants in Project 2. The Analytics and Biostatistics Core (ABC) lead by Eugene Laska Ph.D. and Carole Segal Ph.D. will support experimental design, formulation of hypothesis, power calculations, and data integrity, management and analysis for Project 1, 2 and 3, implementing advanced statistical models for individualized prediction of response to topiramate in Project 1 and Project 2. Overall Narrative We aim to advance personalized topiramate treatment for comorbid AUD and PTSD by focusing on network excitatory and inhibitory imbalances underlying heightened negative emotions and impairments in executive function and emotion regulation. Excitatory and inhibitory targets will be assessed with brain, plasma and circuit markers, where possible harmonizing the approach for optimizing discovery of mechanisms and prediction of topiramate treatment in animal models and in clinical trial participants. We will achieve this aim with a center driven approach to discovery with three integrative design elements and four cross-project center aims, creating translational bridges among animal model,

"Improving Liver Ultrasound Image Quality in Difficult-to-Image Patients ABSTRACT The prevalence of obesity in the United States has risen to record levels over the past 40 years, putting strain on the healthcare system and creating difficult challenges for medical imaging. We propose to overcome the challenges that obesity poses to ultrasound imaging by (1) developing novel image-quality improvement techniques, and (2) implementing them on pulse-echo ultrasound imaging systems to yield high-quality images of the liver. Ultrasound imaging is uniquely affected by the presence of additional connective tissue and thick subcutaneous fat layers in overweight and obese patients; these additional subcutaneous layers greatly exacerbate reverberation and phase-aberration of the acoustic wave, leading to high levels of clutter, degraded resolution, and overall poor-quality ultrasound images. Our proposed methods will determine the local speed-of-sound in abdominal tissue layers and use this information to accomplish distributed phase-aberration correction. We also apply machine learning techniques to model and suppress the effects of reverberation clutter and speckle noise. The combination of these techniques is expected to achieve significant improvements in liver image quality. These image-quality improvement methods will be implemented on a real-time ultrasound scanner and will be evaluated in clinical imaging tasks of overweight and obese patients undergoing ultrasound surveillance of hepatocellular carcinoma. Successful development of the proposed technology will not only enable high-quality ultrasound imaging of the liver in otherwise difficult-to-image overweight and obese patients, but also facilitate improved image quality across nearly all ultrasound imaging applications, for all populations. NARRATIVE This proposal aims to develop and test several new techniques to overcome the current limitations of ultrasound to make high-quality images in overweight and obese individuals. These novel ultrasound techniques will be initially applied to improve liver imaging in overweight and obese patients in a pilot study, though the benefits of this new high-quality imaging technology will extend to all other areas of clinical ultrasound imaging.",Improving Liver Ultrasound Image Quality in Difficult-to-Image Patients,10236260,R01EB027100,"['Abdomen ', ' Abdominal ', ' Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Affect ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Connective Tissue ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Primary carcinoma of the liver cells ', ' Hepatocarcinoma ', ' Hepatocellular Carcinoma ', ' Hepatocellular cancer ', ' Hepatoma ', ' Liver Cells Carcinoma ', ' liver carcinoma ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Liver diseases ', ' Hepatic Disorder ', ' hepatic disease ', ' hepatopathy ', ' liver disorder ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Noise ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' sound ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thyroid Gland ', ' Thyroid ', ' Thyroid Head and Neck ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' United States ', ' Weight ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' improved ', ' liver imaging ', ' liver scanning ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Phase ', ' Lesion ', ' Subcutaneous Tissue ', ' Hypodermis ', ' Subcutis ', ' Superficial Fascia ', ' Tela Subcutanea ', ' subdermal tissue ', ' Attenuated ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' subdermal ', ' subcutaneous ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' fetal ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' Speed ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Modeling ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Cardiac ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Cirrhosis ', ' cirrhotic ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prototype ', ' patient population ', ' elastography ', ' elastic imaging ', ' elasticity imaging ', ' radio frequency ', ' radiofrequency ', ' imaging system ', ' clinical imaging ', ' neural network ', ' Patient imaging ', ' obese person ', ' obese individuals ', ' obese people ', ' obese population ', ' obese subjects ', ' high body mass index ', ' high BMI ', ' obese patients ', ' patients with obesity ', ' ']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,585234,CA-18
"Genomic medicine and gene function implementation for an underserved population PROJECT SUMMARY Here we propose to advance the goal of NHGRI to implement genomic medicine and focus on individuals who have not been able to afford DNA testing. The research takes place in the Department of Molecular and Human Genetics at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) and Texas Childrens Hospital (TCH). Our team of clinicians, geneticists, computer scientists, genomicists and model organism researchers has had a five-year term of success with the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) Model Organisms Screening Center (MOSC). This has included successfully identifying a number of new disease genes such as EBF3, IRF2BPL, NACC1, TBX2, TOMM70, CDK19, ACOX1, WDR37, and ATP5F1D. We propose to recruit 100 individuals from an underserved population in Houston, Texas with suspected rare disease and without the means to pay for DNA sequencing through insurance. We will provide whole-exome sequencing which will generate a CAP/CLIA report that we anticipate could diagnose 35-40 individuals per year. The remaining individuals will then be converted to a family-based trio exome design. All the sequencing costs of this project will be covered by philanthrophic donation to our hospital and are not budgeted to the grant. We will make every effort to diagnose the remaining 60 individuals per year through machine learning and informatics using the MARRVEL platform, Drosophila functional studies of candidate genes and through ongoing 6 month, 12 month and 2 year follow-up with the patients where we will use matchmaking efforts such as GeneMatcher and Matchmaker exchange as well as our own genomic databases from the UDN and other studies to come to a genetic diagnosis. All subjects will receive genetic counseling from a trained team and will provide us with valuable medical, psychological and social data to guide how genomic implementation in an underserved population is perceived, impacts care and impacts the family. This work will not only produce novel insights into rare disease, diagnosis for undiagnosed families and an expanded role for genomics, it will guide us in the future to provide genomics and functional research to serve all individuals regardless of their ability to pay. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research study uses DNA sequencing to find a diagnose for families with children with a rare disease who may not be able to afford DNA sequencing studies. We use clinical testing, followed by more extensive computer technology and genetic research using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster to study genetic variation in patients with rare and undiagnosed disease.

"Prospective Health Outcomes and Inflammatory Biomarkers Associated with e-Cigarette Use Project Summary. This project is designed to identify validated biomarkers for use in the assessment of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) by the FDA. Since the introduction of ENDS, commonly referred to as e-cigarettes, there has been a large increase in ENDS use among young adults and older traditional cigarette smokers who also use ENDS (dual users). Since 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has had regulatory authority over ENDS, and there is an acute need for ENDS-related biomarkers that can be used as validated surrogate endpoints for evaluation of new ENDS products. With the goal of validated biomarker discovery in two independent cohorts, the COPDGene and UCSD ENDS studies, we propose to identify ENDS-related inflammatory biomarkers in ENDS only and dual users and relate these biomarkers to five-year lung health outcomes. COPDGene is an ongoing, longitudinal study of >6,000 current and former traditional cigarette (t-cig) smokers enriched for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with detailed longitudinal lung phenotyping data (including chest CT), genome-wide blood RNA-seq, and proteomic data. The UCSD ENDS Study is a controlled study of young ENDS only users and controls with detailed assessment of inflammatory biomarkers in the oropharynx, airways and blood.  Biomarkers used as validated surrogate measures must be 1) associated with ENDS use, 2) predictive of health outcomes, and 3) have a strong biological rationale. We hypothesize that inflammatory biomarkers of ENDS use will be predictive of five-year lung health effects. In Aim 1 of this proposal, discovery of inflammatory transcriptomic and proteomic biomarkers of ENDS exposure will be performed in subjects from the COPDGene five-year study visit, and biomarkers will be validated in two independent sets of subjects from the COPDGene ten-year visit and the UCSD ENDS Study. In Aim 2 we will identify antibody-specific adaptive immune response biomarkers of ENDS exposure using adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-seq). Auto-antibodies are biomarkers that are associated with the degree of lung damage in COPD. AIRR-seq is a powerful tool for inflammatory biomarker discovery that characterizes an individual’s decades-long history of antibody responses. In Aim 3 we will use machine learning predictive models to relate ENDS-associated biomarker panels to five-year lung health outcomes from COPDGene. The investigative team for this grant is well-positioned to identify novel inflammatory biomarkers of ENDS use. The COPDGene and UCSD cohorts have the detailed lung phenotyping and molecular characterization necessary to discover and clinically validate biomarkers in two important populations of ENDS users, i.e. ENDS only and dual users.

"Novel mechanisms and treatment of arrhythmia during resuscitation Resuscitation from sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is typically initiated in patients with ongoing ischemia and ventricular fibrillation (VF) or tachycardia (VT) that, even if successful, is commonly followed by repeated rearrest. Despite significant efforts to improve resuscitation from SCA, survival remains poor prompting NIH to identify resuscitation as a high priority for emergency care research. Beat-to-beat alternans of cellular repolarization in the myocardium (repolarization alternans) is a substrate for arrhythmias, is rampant during resuscitation, and is manifested on the ECG as T-wave oscillations that can alternate (2:1) or as more complex oscillations. In preliminary studies, we observed in resuscitation patients and in an in vivo translational model of resuscitation from SCA, that rearrest due to VT/VF is preceded by T-wave oscillations that are complex; whereas, rearrest due to pulseless electrical activity (PEA) is preceded by increased T-wave oscillations that alternate. Accordingly, we contend that when T-wave oscillations are complex, repolarization alternans in the myocardium is spatially discordant, which is repolarization alternans occurring out-of-phase in adjacent regions and is highly arrhythmogenic. In contrast, when T-wave oscillations alternate, repolarization alternans in the myocardium is spatially in-phase (concordant), which poses no known immediate arrhythmia risk but is associated with mechanical dysfunction and, thus, PEA. Finally, in the absence of any repolarization alternans, risk of rearrest due to PEA or VT/VF is low. We hypothesize that during resuscitation rearrest due to VT/VF or PEA is strongly linked to repolarization alternans in the myocardium that is spatially discordant or not, respectively, and that specifically targeting the underlying mechanisms can prevent rearrest due to VT/VF and, possibly, PEA. In addition, the full spectrum of ECG T-wave oscillations can be utilized to predict no rearrest and rearrest from VT/VF or PEA and, thus, be used in the future as a biomarker to guide therapy and significantly improve outcomes. Our hypotheses will be tested with the following aims. 1) Determine the mechanistic relationship between cellular repolarization alternans and rearrest due to VT/VF or PEA in an in vivo model of resuscitation. 2) Determine if targeting the mechanisms of repolarization alternans can prevent rearrest during resuscitation, thereby gaining additional mechanistic insight. 3) Develop and test an ECG biomarker for predicting risk of rearrest due to VT/VF and PEA in resuscitation patients. To achieve these aims, we will utilize sophisticated instrumentation and signal processing in an in vivo translational model of resuscitation as well as in pre-hospital and in- hospital resuscitation patients. We have also established a highly translational collaboration that combines expertise in emergency medicine, cardiac arrhythmia, and clinical electrophysiology. Our scientific environment provides a unique opportunity to develop a better understanding of arrhythmia mechanisms relevant to resuscitation in order to develop novel and effective therapies. Project Narrative Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) due to arrhythmia is a major public health problem and despite significant efforts to improve resuscitation from SCA, rearrest and survival remain poor. Consequently, improved approaches are needed, and NIH has recently identified resuscitation as a high priority for emergency care research.

"Rule-based machine learning to address heterogeneity in high-dimensional survival data Project Summary In the post-genomic era, researchers are met with an abundance of data to analyze and interpret. Genome- wide association analyses (GWAS) often boast millions of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), alongside increasingly large epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic (multi-omic) and other data sets. While the current standard in genetic epidemiology emphasizes increased sample sizes, we propose that substantial progress can be made by developing improved methods to analyze the vast amount of multi-omic data that currently exists. A number of methodological challenges including dimensionality and the multiple testing burden have limited the success of many approaches thus far. Furthermore, only considering simple, linear associations leaves out the more likely scenario of complex genetic and multi-omic relationships driving risk and outcomes in common diseases. Heterogeneity is just one of the complex mechanisms that underlies disease risk and outcomes, but is arguably among the most difficult to model and detect. This project tackles this and other challenges in glioma, a highly heterogeneous cancer type. Improving upon available treatment strategies in cancer and glioma specifically will undoubtedly require a full characterization of genetic heterogeneity and epigenetic mechanisms. In addition to confronting the dimensionality of genetic and epigenetic data using a feature selection strategy that can detect both main effects and interaction and preserve heterogeneity, we will modify an existing method for detecting heterogeneity to accommodate censored survival data. First, in Aim 1, we will use simulated genetic survival data to establish the utility of a Relief-based feature selection algorithm in capturing complex genetic architectures (i.e., main effects, heterogeneity, and epistasis). We will compare it against standard approaches for high-dimensional feature selection of survival data. Aim 2 updates a learning classifier system (LCS), a type of rule-based machine learning that uses IF/THEN rules to model complex and heterogeneous problem spaces. To our knowledge, no LCS that handles censored survival data has been developed to date. After testing our survival LCS on simulated data and comparing it to standard survival methods, in Aim 3 we will implement it using somatic mutation and methylation data from the TCGA glioma dataset. Finally, as part of Aim 3, we will perform a pathway analysis using the LCS output in an effort to identify common biological pathways underlying heterogeneous associations. We will also utilize a network visualization tool to better understand interactions between features and provide a visual interpretation of the results. Findings from this project will lay the foundation for precision care and treatment of glioma. Our innovative approach to high-dimensional, heterogeneous survival data will be both generalizable and interpretable, qualities that are missing from current machine learning approaches. This project and the accompanying training plan undeniably provide an ideal setting to develop the skills and experience necessary to become and independent investigator at the forefront of genetic epidemiology and informatics. Project Narrative Current approaches to analyzing genetic and other large data sets fail to suitably model heterogeneity – a phenomenon where different mechanisms give rise to the same disease; these methods similarly struggle with capturing interactions and other complex patterns of association. A full characterization of this complexity is necessary to fully understand and predict risk and outcomes in common diseases. Using both simulated and publicly available survival data, this proposal will develop and evaluate a machine learning method for identifying important variables and making predictions in the context of complex associations.",Rule-based machine learning to address heterogeneity in high-dimensional survival data,10141575,F31LM013583,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Alkylating Agents ', ' Alkylators ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Brain Neoplasms ', ' Brain Neoplasia ', ' Brain Tumors ', ' tumors in the brain ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cox Models ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Elements ', ' Genetic Epistasis ', ' Epistasis ', ' Epistatic Deviation ', ' Interaction Deviation ', ' epistatic relationship ', ' gene x gene interaction ', ' genetic epistases ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' Glioma ', ' Glial Cell Tumors ', ' Glial Neoplasm ', ' Glial Tumor ', ' Neuroglial Neoplasm ', ' Neuroglial Tumor ', ' glial-derived tumor ', ' neuroglia neoplasm ', ' neuroglia tumor ', ' Head ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Histones ', ' Incidence ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Methylation ', ' Genetic Models ', ' Persons ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Promoter Regions ', ' Promotor Regions ', ' genetic promoter element ', ' genetic promoter sequence ', ' promoter sequence ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' temozolomide ', ' Temodal ', ' Temodar ', ' methazolastone ', ' forest ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' tumor progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant -

"Mechanoresponsive Engrailed-1-negative fibroblasts activate Engrailed-1 to promote fibrosis in wound healing 7. Project Summary/Abstract Adult human skin heals by developing fibrotic scar tissue, which can result in devastating disfigurement, growth restriction, and permanent functional loss. Despite a plethora of clinical options, no current treatment strategies successfully prevent or reverse this fibrotic process, and scars and their sequelae cost the United States over $20 billion every year. Progress towards the development of new therapies has been significantly hindered by a lack of understanding of the specific cell populations responsible for scarring. In 2015, our group reported that Engrailed-1 (En-1) lineage-positive fibroblasts (EPFs) are responsible for the vast majority of dorsal scar production in postnatal mice. In early fetal gestation, mice heal scarlessly via skin regeneration, an ideal outcome mediated by En-1 lineage-negative fibroblasts (ENFs; the predominant fetal fibroblast). However, it has not been established if ENFs contribute to postnatal wound healing. In this proposal, we explore for the first time the postnatal conversion of ENFs to pro-fibrotic EPFs (postnatally-derived EPFs; pEPFs) within the wound environment. First, histology, immunohistochemistry, and wounding in a novel transgenic mouse model will be used to study the conversion of ENFs to pEPFs during wound healing. By examining the behavior of ENF subpopulations (derived from papillary dermis, reticular dermis, and hypodermis) in the wound environment and confirming our findings in a tamoxifen-inducible mouse model of En-1 activation, we will precisely define the ENF population that gives rise to pro-fibrotic pEPFs. Second, we will establish the specific wound environment cues that drive ENF-to-EPF transition. Given that mechanical forces are known to modulate both scar burden and fibroblast activity, we will use in vitro and in vivo models to examine the effects of mechanical environment on En-1 activation. We will further use transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling to explore the role of mechanotransduction signaling in ENF-to-EPF transition and pEPF function. Third, having established a mechanotransduction mechanism underlying En-1 activation in wound ENFs, we will inhibit mechanotransduction signaling with the goal of blocking ENF-to-EPF transition. Specifically, we will assess whether blocking mechanotransduction results in ENF-mediated wound healing with reduced fibrosis. Our ultimate translational goal is to develop therapeutics that target fibrogenic fibroblasts to promote regenerative healing. Collectively, the proposed work will significantly enhance our understanding of the key molecular and cellular determinants of cutaneous scarring, inform the development of novel anti-scarring therapies, and shed light on the cellular origin of dermal scarring fibroblasts. 8. Project Narrative Scarring is the end result of injury in adult human skin and results in an enormous financial and medical burden for our society. There are currently no effective molecular therapies that prevent scarring or its sequelae, and development of therapeutics has been hindered by lack of understanding of the precise cell populations that mediate fibrosis in wound healing. Therefore, we propose to explore the contribution of a specific fibroblast subpopulation (Engrailed-1 lineage-negative fibroblasts; ENFs) in fibrotic wound healing, in order to inform novel directions for targeted treatments that minimize scarring and promote regenerative wound healing.",Mechanoresponsive Engrailed-1-negative fibroblasts activate Engrailed-1 to promote fibrosis in wound healing,10130573,R01GM136659,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Behavior ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cultured Cells ', ' Chromatin ', ' Cicatrix ', ' Scars ', ' Collagen ', ' Connective Tissue ', ' Cues ', ' Dermis ', ' Corium ', ' Cutis ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Extracellular Matrix ', ' Cell-Extracellular Matrix ', ' ECM ', ' Fibroblasts ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Histology ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' In Vitro ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Maps ', ' Transgenic Mice ', ' Microscopy ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Production ', ' Proteins ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Societies ', ' Mechanical Stress ', ' Tamoxifen ', ' Time ', ' tissue culture ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' wound healing ', ' Wound Repair ', ' wound resolution ', ' Focal Adhesion Kinase 1 ', ' PTK2 Protein Tyrosine Kinase 2 ', ' endogenous substrate pp120 ', ' focal adhesion kinase ', ' focal adhesion protein tyrosine kinase ', ' focal adhesion-associated protein tyrosine kinase pp125FAK ', ' Transposase ', ' Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting ', ' Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting Fractionation ', ' Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sortings ', ' Measures ', ' Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV ', ' Adenosine Deaminase-Binding Proteins ', ' CD26 ', ' CD26 Antigens ', ' Mediating ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' Dorsal ', ' Site ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Papillary ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Medical ', ' Chemicals ', ' Cutaneous ', ' Dermal ', ' Hair follicle structure ', ' Hair Follicle ', ' Fiber ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' analog ', ' Subcutaneous Tissue ', ' Hypodermis ', ' Subcutis ', ' Superficial Fascia ', ' Tela Subcutanea ', ' subdermal tissue ', ' Engraftment ', ' tool ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' BPD verteporfin ', ' BPD-MA ', ' Benzoporphyrin Derivative Monoacid Ring A ', ' Visudyne ', ' benzoporphyrin D ', ' verteporphin ', ' Verteporfin ', ' postnatal ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' fetal ', ' Hydrogels ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' Skin ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Protein Inhibition ', ' in vivo ', ' in vivo Model ', ' Anatomic Surface ', ' Cellular Assay ', ' cell assay ', ' Wild Type Mouse ', ' wildtype mouse ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' epigenomics ', ' cost ', ' healing ', ' reconstruction ', ' digital ', ' Outcome ', ' wound ', ' tissue wound ', ' wounding ', ' wounds ', ' Population ', ' transcriptomics ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' therapeutic target ', ' functional loss ', ' therapeutic development ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' treatment strategy ', ' regenerative ', ' skin regeneration ', ' regenerate skin ', ' skin healing ', ' High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing ', ' High-Throughput Sequencing ', ' mechanotransduction ', ' mechanosensing ', ' mechanical force ', ' skin wound ', ' cutaneous wound ', ' dermal wound ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' wound environment ', ' wound bed ', ' ']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,317427,CA-18
"Analysis of Nematode Sex Determination and Dosage Compensation PROJECT SUMMARY  Studies are proposed to dissect one of the fundamental, binary development decisions that most metazoans make: their sex. The nematode C. elegans determines sex with remarkable precision by tallying X- chromosome number relative to the sets of autosomes (X:A signal): ratios of 1X:2A (0.5) and 2X:3A (0.67) signal male fate, while ratios of 3X:4A (0.75) and 2X:2A (1.0) signal hermaphrodite fate. We have discovered much about the nature and action of the X:A signal and its direct target, a master sex-determination-switch gene that also controls X-chromosome dosage compensation. However, a fundamental question remains: how is the signal interpreted reproducibly in an ""all or none"" manner to elicit fertile male or hermaphrodite development, never intersexual development? We pioneer new methods using machine learning neural networks to address this question with single-molecule and single-cell resolution. We also propose to dissect the functional interplay between chromatin modification and chromosome structure in regulating gene expression over vast chromosomal territories. X-chromosome dosage compensation in C. elegans is exemplary for this analysis: we found recently that dosage-compensated X chromosomes have (i) elevated levels of modified histone H4K20me1 compared to autosomes and (ii) a unique three-dimensional architecture. Both are imposed by the dosage compensation complex (DCC). Loss of H4K20me1 disrupts 3D architecture and elevates X gene expression. In the nematode DCC, one subunit is an H4K20me2 demethylase and five subunits are homologs of condensin subunits, which compact and resolve mitotic and meiotic chromosomes. All DCC subunits are recruited specifically to hermaphrodite X chromosomes by an XX-specific subunit that triggers binding to cis- acting regulatory elements on X (rex) to reduce gene expression by half. The DCC remodels the structure of X into topologically associating domains (TADs) using its highest affinity rex sites to establish domain boundaries. Despite this knowledge, important questions underlying the mechanisms of dosage compensation remain. What DCC subunits recognize the X-enriched motifs in rex sites to bind X directly? How does the DCC regulate RNA polymerase II to repress gene expression? What mechanisms underlie H4K20me1's control of chromosome structure, and how does DCC-mediated higher-order structure affect gene expression? Our findings should have broad implications, because (i) condensin complexes control chromosome structure from bacteria to man, (ii) H4K20me1 is enriched on the inactive X of female mammals, (iii) demethylases are linked to tumor progression, and (iv) the H4K20me2 demethylase modulates nematode growth, metabolism, and entry into the quiescent dauer state. Lastly, we will exploit our unexpected finding that rex sites have diverged across Caenorhabditis species separated by 30 MYR, retaining no functional overlap despite strong conservation of the core DCC machinery. This divergence provides an unusual opportunity to study the path for a concerted co- evolutionary change in hundreds of target sites across X chromosomes and the protein complexes that bind them. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our work dissects one of the fundamental, binary developmental decisions that most metazoans make: their sex. While we have discovered detailed molecular mechanisms about the nature and action of the signal that determines sex in the nematode C. elegans and its direct target, a critical question remains that we address: how is the sex signal interpreted reproducibly in an ""all or none"" manner to elicit fertile male or hermaphrodite development, never intersexual development? Our work also explores the functional interplay between chromosome structure, chromatin modification, and long-distance regulation of gene expression by studying X- chromosome dosage compensation. The nematode dosage compensation complex, a condensin complex, equalizes X-chromosome gene expression between the sexes by imposing a unique three-dimensional architecture onto hermaphrodite X chromosomes and by catalyzing enrichment of the modified histone H4K20me1 through a subunit that is a H4K20me2 histone demethylase. Results from exploring the connection between higher-order chromosome structure and chromatin modification should have broad implications, because (i) condensin complexes control chromosome structure from bacteria to man, (ii) H4K20me1 is enriched on the inactive X of female mammals, (iii) demethylases are linked to tumor progression, and (iv) the H4K20me2 demethylase modulates nematode growth, metabolism, and entry into the quiescent dauer state.",Analysis of Nematode Sex Determination and Dosage Compensation,10130561,R35GM131845,"['Affect ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Bacteria ', ' Caenorhabditis ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Dosage Compensation (Genetics) ', ' Dosage Compensation ', ' Female ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Switch Genes ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Hermaphroditism ', ' Intersexuality ', ' Histones ', ' male ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Meiosis ', ' meiotic ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methods ', ' Nematoda ', ' Nematodes ', ' roundworm ', ' RNA Polymerase II ', ' DNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase II ', ' RNA Polymerase B ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Work ', ' X Chromosome ', ' X Inactivation ', ' Lyonization ', ' X-Chromosome Inactivation ', ' Mediating ', ' Caenorhabditis elegans ', ' C elegans ', ' C. elegans ', ' C.elegans ', ' dosage ', ' tumor progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' Site ', ' Link ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' autosome ', ' Structure ', ' Chromosomal Organization ', ' Chromosomal Structure ', ' Chromosome Organization ', ' Chromosome Structures ', ' single molecule ', ' condensin ', ' chromatin modification ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' protein complex ', ' sex determination ', ' Address ', ' Affinity ', ' Higher Order Chromatin Folding ', ' Higher Order Structure ', ' Higher Order Chromatin Structure ', ' Mitotic ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Resolution ', ' Chromosome Territory ', ' Chromosomal Territory ', ' Molecular ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' histone demethylase ', ' recruit ', ' neural network ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R35,2021,466290,CA-13
"Predictive biomarkers of treatment response in kidney transplant rejection PROJECT SUMMARY The overall purpose of this proposal is to develop predictive biomarkers of treatment outcome in kidney transplant rejection, specifically in T-cell mediated rejection (TCMR), as the response to treatment can be variable, is currently not predictable by clinical diagnostics nor understood from a mechanistic sense, and even partial treatment failure is associated with shortened graft longevity. In each aim, we make use of residual diagnostic biopsy samples with paired richly-detailed clinical data and timelines including treatments, graft functional responses and outcomes. In this manner, we track along the clinical timeline of TCMR, with each aim addressing an unsolved clinical problem in the field. Through the same approach, experimental data from this unique “model system” of tissue inflammation studied over time provides a rich discovery set for understanding tissue-resident T cell behavior in the human kidney. Aim 1 looks at the whole transcriptome profiles of initial acute episodes of TCMR prior to treatment, to identify a gene expression signature predictive of resistance/sensitivity to standard therapies for rejection. When treatment fails, grafts frequently contain residual T cell infiltrates, but the causal connection between these cells and long- term outcome is unclear. For example, residual infiltrates may represent (i) contracting/egressing populations of T cells effectively treated, (ii) newly recruited T cells mounting a fresh rejection response where repeat therapy may be prudent, or (iii) scant memory T cells with established tissue posts and capable of inciting repeat inflammation. Therefore, in Aim 2, we focus on post-treatment biopsies of treatment failure, characterizing multiple spatio-phenotypic aspects of the T cell infiltrate by high dimensional immunofluorescence microscopy with digital image processing and quantitative spatial analysis, to determine which functional phenotypic T cell subsets in which specific tissue niches, correlate with poor graft outcomes. These complementary but independent aims will be achieved through established cross-disciplinary collaborations and with partial industry support. PROJECT NARRATIVE Kidney transplantation is life saving and compared to dialysis improves patient quality of life and decreases healthcare costs over time, but graft longevity is compromised by immunologic rejection and inadequate immunosuppression. Timely appropriate therapy for rejection can preserve graft longevity, but biomarkers to predict response to therapy are lacking, leading some centers to over-treat, putting patients at risk of infection and malignancy, while clinical protocols at other centers may under-treat, putting patients at risk of accelerated graft decline. Therefore, development of tests to guide appropriate selection of therapy for rejection would be clinically useful, and discovery-based platforms for biomarker identification have the potential to yield not only clinically useful tests but also to reveal biologic mechanisms of treatment resistance and potential new targets for therapy.",Predictive biomarkers of treatment response in kidney

"Phenotype screens of Chlamydia Inclusions Abstract Chlamydia trachomatis is a major health concern with over 200 million people with active urogenital or ocular infection each year worldwide. Chlamydia are obligate intracellular bacteria with a unique biphasic developmental cycle. A better understanding of that biphasic cycle can lead to inhibitors that are specific for chlamydial infection in order to avoid overuse of antibiotics. Individual Chlamydia are too small and tightly packed to be spatially separated with conventional light microscopes, and 3D SEM is too labor-intensive for inhibitor studies. We will use a new sample preparation method that physically expands the sample with polymers termed ""Expansion Microscopy"" or ExM. Expanded samples can then be imaged with a traditional confocal microscope, and high-content analysis performed automatically using machine learning methods such as pixel classification and novelty detection. Prepared samples can be imaged and analyzed in under an hour instead of the multiple days required for 3D SEM. This R03 grant will develop an innovative high-content screening platform, called Expansion Microscopy Aided Phenotyping (ExMAP), for the quantification of changes in Chlamydia development after treatment. ExMAP can be paired with Chlamydia transformed with promoters for EUO and IhtA (RB cell types) and the promoters for HctB and Tarp (EB cell types). The combination of expansion microscopy, machine learning, and chlamydial transformation will make ExMAP a powerful tool for research on both the developmental cycle and new therapy development. Project Narrative This project will develop a new high-content platform, termed ExMAP, that will physically expand the sample of interest and then utilize machine learning for image analysis. At the completion of the project, we expect to have developed a new method for the study of the Chlamydia developmental cycle and inhibitors that disrupt that cycle.",Phenotype screens of Chlamydia Inclusions,10128374,R03AI146437,"['Acrylates ', ' Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Bacteria ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chlamydia ', ' Miyagawanella ', ' bedsonia ', ' Chlamydia Infections ', ' Chlamydial Infection ', ' chlamydial disease ', ' Chlamydia trachomatis ', ' C trachomatis ', ' C. trachomatis ', ' Rickettsia trachomae ', ' Chloramphenicol ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Eye Infections ', ' Ocular Infections ', ' Gel ', ' Developmental Gene ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Iron Chelating Agents ', ' Iron Chelates ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Malaria ', ' Paludism ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Methods ', ' Microbiology ', ' Microscopy ', ' Electron Microscopy ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Penicillins ', ' Phenotype ', ' PF4 Gene ', ' Antiheparin Factor ', ' Blood Platelet Factor IV ', ' Blood platelet factor 4 ', ' Chemokine (C-X-C motif) Ligand 4 ', ' Factor 4 ', ' Heparin Neutralizing Protein ', ' Platelet Factor 4 ', ' Recombinant Platelet Factor 4 ', ' SCYB4 ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine B4 ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine Subfamily B, Member 4 ', ' gamma-Thromboglobulin ', ' platelet factor IV ', ' Polymers ', ' Research ', ' Sodium ', ' Na element ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Drug Costs ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' Microscope ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Clinical ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Confocal Microscopy ', ' Agonist ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Hour ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Light Microscope ', ' interest ', ' novel ', ' Sampling ', ' GU Infection ', ' Genitourinary infection ', ' infectious disease of genitourinary system ', ' urogenital infection ', ' Genitourinary System Infection ', ' small molecule ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Resolution ', ' Preparation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' pathogen ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' screening ', ' small molecule inhibitor ', ' SIRT1 gene ', ' SIRT1 ', ' Sirtuin 1 ', ' chlamydia vaccine ', ' Drug Screening ', ' human pathogen ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' Chlamydia genome ', ' chlamydial genome ', ' ']",NIAID,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY,R03,2021,77243,NC-06
"Systematic discovery, characterization, and design of novel genome editing and delivery tools using a high-throughput metagenomic screening pipeline Project Summary Despite extraordinary advances in genome engineering, tools for precise and efficient gene correction and delivery across all cell types remain lacking. Current programmable DNA cleavage tools, such as meganucleases, Zinc finger nucleases, transcription activator like effector nucleases (TALENs), and CRISPR- Cas9, rely on recruiting the DNA repair machinery, either using error-prone, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair for gene knockout, or homology directed repair (HDR) for precise correction. However, HDR is inactive in post-mitotic cells, such as neurons, and is often inefficient, achieving 50% correction at most. Genome editing still lacks efficient, robust tools that can insert, delete, and recombine large stretches of DNA sequence. Moreover, delivery tools are a significant barrier to deploying tissue-specific genomic engineering technologies as current vehicles, including widely-used viral vectors and liposomal approaches, have limited capacity, offer variable efficiency, and lack precise tissue tropism. The proposed work involves computationally mining bacteria for new classes of gene editing enzymes and delivery vectors. We know that natural recombinases and transposases can mediate programmed DNA rearrangement and insertion, and these classes of enzymes are present in phage defense and mobile islands in bacteria, which largely remain uncharacterized. Additionally, recent work has demonstrated that retroviral/retrotransposon gag-like proteins can self-assemble and encapsulate nucleic acid in extracellular vesicles (EVs) and viral-like particles (VLPs) for cell-to-cell communication. As with defense islands, these proteins can also be systematically catalogued via a bioinformatic pipeline and experimentally characterized. The proposed work will focus on three main goals: 1) signatures for phage defense, mobile genetic activity, or VLP-forming activity will be mined to build a machine learning pipeline for comprehensively discovering novel gene clusters from novel metagenomic sequences with a focus for proteins that can manipulate nucleic acid or self-assemble, 2) candidate gene clusters will be cloned from metagenomic samples and undergo high-throughput screening using biochemical and bacterial assays for gene editing and capsid formation, as well as engineering to hone activity, and 3) the most promising candidates will be evaluated for activity in mammalian systems with assays for highly efficient gene insertion and VLP formation. The work will elucidate novel bacterial phage defense and VLP biology, and result in the development of new technologies for more efficient genetic manipulation and gene delivery. Moreover, this gene exploration and engineering framework will serve as a model for discovering diverse bacterial gene clusters and defense systems, evaluating biochemical activity across a range of assays, and converting these findings into high impact biotechnologies. The developed technologies will accelerate the pace of biomedical research and enable greater exploration of basic biological processes and disease mechanisms. Project Narrative There are more than 5,000 human diseases caused by known genetic variation, including mutations, insertions, and deletions, but programmable tools and delivery vectors to reliably study and model these diseases are lacking. We propose a two-pronged approach to discovering novel gene editing and delivery strategies by (1) mining bacterial and archaeal systems to identify novel defense systems and enzymes that have activities useful for genome editing and (2) identifying gene clusters linked to extracellular vesicle or viral-like particle formation that will allow development of better gene delivery systems. The technologies developed from this work will accelerate the study and modeling of disease biology and provide a framework for general prokaryotic gene discovery across many biotechnological areas.","Systematic discovery, characterization, and design of novel genome editing and delivery tools using a high-throughput metagenomic screening pipeline",10128377,R21AI149694,"['Bacteria ', '

"Novel computational approaches to predict drug response and combination effects Summary Tailoring the most desired therapy to each individual patient is the primary goal of precision medicine. A reliable and robust predictive model of drug effectiveness based on patients' unique genomic background is the key. For decades, communities have been trying to establish the relationship between molecular characteristics and drug response in complex diseases. Over the last decade, a large amount of genomic and epigenomic data together with pharmacogenomics data and response to perturbations data has been generated for many human cell lines through collaborations in the research community. These projects have led to significant therapeutic discoveries and have provided unprecedented opportunities to predict drug response using molecular fingerprints. However, even with great interest and effort in developing computational methods for predicting drug response, the prediction accuracies are at best only moderate. A related but distinct question is to understand the mechanisms of action (MOA) of drugs. Understanding drug MOAs enables characterization of drug side effects and identification of old drugs for new uses (i.e. drug repositioning). The traditional experimental assays to identify MOAs of drugs are expensive and time- consuming. There are three key questions to be addressed in the study. 1. Can novel computational approaches largely improve prediction accuracy of response to single drugs using comprehensive genomic and chemical information? 2. Can computational approaches provide a systematic way to mine genomics and drug response data to generate biological insights into the mechanisms of actions of various drugs? 3. Is it possible to develop an interpretable and accurate computation model to predict drug combination effects using pharmacogenomics data? Inherent features make it very challenging to predict drug response accurately: High-dimensionality of input data, the complex relationship between input features and response data; and heterogeneous drug/compound response patterns across different genetic lineages. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has been making remarkable strides in various applications owing to the rapid progress of “deep learning. In Aim 1 of this study, we will develop novel AI-based approaches to address the computational challenges of improving the prediction accuracy of drug response. In Aim 2 of the study, we will develop a novel computation framework to study of MOA of drugs. In Aim 3, we will develop an interpretable deep-learning based computational framework to predict drug combination effects. In addition, we will develop a user-friendly web portal as an integrated research platform to share the methodology, algorithms and data generated from this proposed study to the research community.

"Center for Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation Genomic data hold the promise of revolutionizing our understanding and treatment of human disease. Multiple barriers stand between the acquisition of the data and realizing these and other benefits. Rapid accumulation of genomic data far exceeds our capacity to reliably interpret genomic variation. New developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning, combined with increased computing power and domain knowledge, provide hope for the deployment of enhanced computational tools in both basic research and clinical practice. Use of these methods critically depends upon reliable characterization of their performance.  The Center for Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation (C-CAGI) will address these needs, through objective evaluation of the state of the art in relating human genetic variation and health. CAGI has had five editions since 2010 with 50 challenges posed to the community taken on by hundreds of predictors, leading to scores of publications about prediction methods and their assessment. We propose for C-CAGI to continue to advance the field of variant interpretation through the following Specific Aims: 1. Develop community experiments to evaluate the quality of computational methods for interpreting genomic variation data. C-CAGI will conduct community experiments in which participants make bona fide blinded predictions of disease related phenotypes on the basis of genomic data. We will engage a diverse predictor community to spur innovation. The CAGI Ethics Forum will vet studies to ensure that privacy and sharing maintain the highest standards and will educate the community. 2. Assess the quality of current computational methods for interpreting genomic variation data; highlight innovations and progress at interactive conferences. Predictions will be evaluated by independent assessors, who will be supported by new assessment approaches from C-CAGI. Results will be presented at CAGI experiment conferences with deep technical engagement, which will be interleaved with reflective CAGIâ meetings that create an environment for a comprehensive evaluation of the field, facilitating identification of major bottlenecks and problems faced by the current genome interpretation approaches. 3. Broadly disseminate the results and conclusions from the CAGI experiments and analysis. C-CAGI will outreach to the broader scientific and clinical community through its publications, and the creation of a calibrated reference integrated into the most common workflows for ready adoption. CAGI will also be represented at international meetings with presentations and workshops. 4. Operate effectively and responsively. C-CAGI will operate efficiently as it closely interacts with hundreds of participants. CAGI will build upon a robust information infrastructure that securely facilitates data dissemination, prediction submission, and assessment. Genomic variation is responsible for numerous rare diseases, for propensity for many common traits and diseases, for drug response, and is a key characteristic of cancer evolution. At present, our ability to characterize genetic differences far exceeds our capacity to interpret them either for basic research understanding or for clinical application.

Tumor cell structures that have been hypothesized as necessary for metastasis are invadopodia, protrusions rich in structural proteins (e.g. Tks5), adhesion proteins (e.g. integrin β1) and proteases (e.g. MT1-MMP), known to degrade the extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins.  A novel, real-time imaging methodology that allows investigation of the in vivo metastatic role of invadopodia found that cells which assemble invadopodia move at “Slow” speeds and are seen in perivascular niches. Outside of perivascular niches, “Fast” motile cells, which do not assemble invadopodia were observed. This method also showed that invadopodia are essential for intravasation in vivo.  Preliminary work has begun to determine which aspects of the Slow phenotype allow invadopodia assembly. Use of novel mathematical models, in vitro microscopy and novel computational image analysis demonstrates that whereas the Fast cells continuously locomote, the Slow cells are in either of two oscillating states: i. Invadopodia state, in which a cell is sessile while it degrades surrounding ECM; ii. Locomotion state, similar to a Fast cell. The oscillation dynamics appear to depend on interactions between the ECM and its receptor integrin β1. Importantly, the Invadopodia, but not Locomotion state, is limited to G1 phase of the cell cycle. Release from G1-arrest amplifies invadopodia, implying that G1-arresting therapies may promote metastasis. This project will identify the mechanisms unique to the Invadopodia state compared to cells that only proliferate or locomote, with the idea of targeting the Invadopodia state.  Overall Hypothesis: the Invadopodia state, which is essential for metastasis, requires a pause in both cell locomotion and cell cycle progression. The initiation and termination of the Invadopodia state are controlled by the interaction between the ECM, invadopodia components integrin β1 and Tks5, as well as the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 (expressed during G1). Aim 1. Determine the role of the cell cycle in regulating the Invadopodia state. Using real-time imaging of cell cycle and invadopodia markers in vitro and in vivo, this Aim tests the hypothesis that cyclin- dependent kinases and corresponding inhibitors regulate the Invadopodia state, but not the Locomotion. Aim 2. Determine the role of ECM-cancer cell interactions in regulating the oscillations between Invadopodia and Locomotion states. This Aim will provide a strategy based on in vivo modification of integrin β1 activity on how to turn Invadopodia state ”off” towards metastatic prevention. Significance. Invadopodia is suggested as a new candidate target for metastatic prevention. The use of cell cycle inhibitors in patients with invadopodia may be accelerating metastatic dissemination. The long- term goal is to predict and prevent metastasis using invadopodia. This project investigates the underlying mechanisms of invadopodia regulation by the cell cycle and oscillations between Invadopodia and Locomotion states. Outcomes will reveal new invadopodia-related targets, which can be used to prevent metastasis in breast cancer.",Targeting invadopodia-related mechanisms of cancer cell invasion and metastasis,10151585,R01CA230777,"['Actins ', ' Adhesions ', ' Affect ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Cell Communication ', ' Cell Interaction ', ' Cell-to-Cell Interaction ', ' Cell Cycle ', ' Cell Division Cycle ', ' cell motility ', ' Cell Locomotion ', ' Cell Migration ', ' Cell Movement ', ' Cellular Migration ', ' Cellular Motility ', ' Motility ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Extracellular Matrix ', ' Cell-Extracellular Matrix ', ' ECM ', ' Feedback ', ' Fluorescence ', ' Goals ', ' In Vitro ', ' Integrins ', ' Integrins Extracellular Matrix ', ' Locomotion ', ' Metalloproteases ', ' Metallopeptidases ', ' Metalloproteinases ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Microscopy ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' Metastasis ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastatic Lesion ', ' Metastatic Mass ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Phosphotransferases ', ' Kinases ', ' Phosphotransferase Gene ', ' Transphosphorylases ', ' Proteins ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' protease E ', ' Extracellular Matrix Proteins ', ' G1 Phase ', ' First Gap Phase ', ' G1 period ', ' Gap Phase 1 ', ' cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B ', ' CDK inhibitor p27 ', ' CDKN1B protein ', ' CDKN4 protein ', ' Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27 ', ' Kip1 protein ', ' p27 Kip1 protein ', ' p27 protein ', ' p27-Kip1 ', ' p27Kip1 protein ', ' base ', ' crosslink ', ' cross-link ', ' Label ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Cyclin-Dependent Kinases ', ' Cyclin-Dependent Protein Kinases ', ' cdk Proteins ', ' Cellular Structures ', ' Cell Components ', ' Cell Structure ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequencies ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' intra-vital microscopy ', ' intravital microscopy ', ' Tumor Cell ', ' neoplastic cell ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' CTTN ', ' CTTN Gene ', ' Cortactin Gene ', ' EMS1 ', ' cortactin ', ' ems1 sequence (mammary tumor and squamous cell carcinoma-associated (p80/85 src substrate)) ', ' EMS1 gene ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Cycle Control ', ' Cell Cycle Regulation ', ' kinase inhibitor ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' MMP14 ', ' MT1-MMP ', ' Matrix Metalloproteinase-14 ', ' Membrane-Type Matrix Metalloproteinase 1 ', ' Membrane-Type Matrix Metalloproteinase 14 ', ' MMP14 gene ', ' breast tumor cell ', ' Breast Cancer Cell ', ' Proliferating ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Cell Cycle Progression ', ' Extracellular Matrix Degradation ', ' G1 Arrest ', ' G1 Block ', ' Scaffolding Protein ', ' Modification ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' knock-down ', ' knockdown ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' chemotherapy ', ' loss of function ', ' intravital imaging ', ' intra-vital imaging ', ' breast imaging ', ' mammary imaging ', ' temporal measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' Structural Protein ', ' serial imaging ', ' longitudinal imaging ', ' real-time images ', ' realtime image ', ' ']",NCI,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R01,2021,379870,PA-02
"Novel Designs and Methods to Remove Hidden Confounding Bias in Health Sciences Abstract A major approach in causal inference literature aimed at mitigating bias due to unmeasured confounding is the so- called instrumental variable (IV) design which relies on identifying a variable which (i) influences the treatment process, (ii) has no direct effect on the outcome other than through the treatment, and (iii) is independent of any unmeasured confounder. IV methods are very well developed and widely used in social and health science, although validity of IV inferences may not be reliable if any of required assumptions (i)-(iii) is violated. This proposal aims to develop (a) new IV methods robust to violation of any of (i)-(iii); (b) New negative control methods that can be used to detect and sometimes to nonparametrically account for unmeasured confounding bias; (c) New bracketing methods for partial inference about causal effects in comparative interrupted time series studies. The proposed methods will be used to address current scientific queries in three major substantive public health areas:(1) to understand the health effects of air pollution; (2) to quantify the causal effects of modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer's disease and related disorders; (3) To uncover the mechanism by which a randomized package of interventions produced a substantial reduction of HIV incidence in a recent major cluster randomized trial of treatment as prevention in Botswana, Africa. Our proposal will provide the best available analytical methods to date to resolve confounding concerns in these high impact public health applications and more broadly in observational studies in the health sciences. Summary This proposal aims to develop new causal inference methods to tame bias due to hidden confounding factors in obser- vational studies as well as in randomized experiments subject to non-adherence.

"Understanding membrane proteins’ allosteric modulation with cryo-EM Project Summary/Abstract My laboratory's research is focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms key to the regulation of membrane protein function and to the modulation of their output signaling. We use cryo-EM and advanced classification methods, such as manifold embedding, combined with modeling and molecular dynamics to study how ligands produce shifts in conformation equilibria and bias signaling output. We are currently studying two systems that allow us to study how different types of ligands influence the gating of ion channels. We are studying the role of lipids in triggering gating of mechanosensitive channels of the MscS family, a model system of membrane tension-sensing which can yield important information about the fundamental principles governing ion channel gating and the role that lipid-protein interactions play in this process. We have a longstanding interest in the mechanism and modulation of the ryanodine receptor (RyR), a calcium release channel fundamental to heart and skeletal function. We are using manifold embedding, a machine learning-based method to analyze cryo-EM images, to better understand how small molecules and ions such as calcium and ATP affect the conformational energy landscape of the channel. We aim to shed light on the gating mechanism of this very large ion channel, a prerequisite to understanding of its modulation by protein ligands, post-translational modifications and drugs. Our approach to these fundamental problems is to use a commbination of cryo-electron microscopy, advanced image classification techniques, modelling and molecular dynamics simulations to delineate allosteric pathways mechanistically and then test proposed models with biophysical methods such as single-channel measurements, HDX-MS and mutagenesis. Our ultimate aim is to greatly increase our molecular understanding of the gating and allosteric modulation of ion channels. Progress towards such knowledge has the potential to open the way for the design of small molecule allosteric modulators with very well controlled effects on their targets, aiding the development of drugs with limited side effects. A longer-term aim is to further develp and use our tools towards gaining a better understanding of allosteric modulation in other classes of membrane proteins of therapeutic importance. In particular, G protein-coupled receptor ligands can induce the selective binding of different transducers in a process called biased signaling. The molecular mechanisms at play in this process are still poorly understood despite their fundamental importance for the development of safer drugs. Project Narrative Ion channels are involved in a large number of vital processes, such as heart and muscle function for the ryanodine receptor and function of kidneys and regulation of blood pressure for mechanosensitive channels. This work focuses on understanding the function and regulation of ion channels. Better understanding of small ligand and lipid-protein interactions in these channels can lead more generally to a better understanding of ion channels function and to the design of drugs treating the numerous diseases associated with their malfunction.",Understanding membrane proteins’ allosteric modulation with cryo-EM,10178048,R35GM133598,"['Affect ', ' Calcium ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug Design ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Family ', ' Heart ', ' Ion Channel Gating ', ' Ion Channel Gatings ', ' Ion Channel ', ' Ionic Channels ', ' Membrane Channels ', ' Ions ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Ligands ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Lipids ', ' Membrane Proteins ', ' Membrane Protein Gene ', ' Membrane-Associated Proteins ', ' Surface Proteins ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' Play ', ' Post-Translational Protein Processing ', ' Post-Translational Modification Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Post-Translational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Protein Modification ', ' Posttranslational Modifications ', ' Posttranslational Protein Processing ', ' Protein Modification ', ' Proteins ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Transducers ', ' Work ', ' Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel ', ' Ca Release Channel-Ryanodine Receptor ', ' Calcium-Ryanodine Receptor Complex ', ' Ryanodine Receptor ', ' Mutagenesis ', ' Genetics-Mutagenesis ', ' Mutagenesis Molecular Biology ', ' base ', ' Muscle function ', ' heart function ', ' cardiac function ', ' function of the heart ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' skeletal ', ' interest ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' Molecular Dynamics Simulation ', ' molecular dynamics ', ' Cryo-electron Microscopy ', ' Electron Cryomicroscopy ', ' cryo-EM ', ' cryoEM ', ' Cryoelectron Microscopy ', ' BP control ', ' BP homeostasis ', ' BP management ', ' BP regulation ', ' blood pressure control ', ' blood pressure homeostasis ', ' blood pressure management ', ' regulate BP ', ' regulate blood pressure ', ' blood pressure regulation ', ' G Protein-Complex Receptor ', ' G Protein-Coupled Receptor Genes ', ' GPCR ', ' G-Protein-Coupled Receptors ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' drug development ', ' native protein drug ', ' pharmaceutical protein ', ' protein drug agent ', ' therapeutic protein ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' small molecule ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' protein function ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Output ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' biophysical techniques ', ' biophysical approaches ', ' biophysical methodology ', ' biophysical methods ', ' side effect ', ' ']",NIGMS,ADVANCED SCIENCE RESEARCH CENTER,R35,2021,392500,NY-13
"Mechanisms of mechano-chemical rupture of blood clots and thrombi Mechanisms of mechano-chemical rupture of blood clots and thrombi Prashant K. Purohit, John L. Bassani, Valeri Barsegov and John W. Weisel The goal of this proposal is to explore and understand the fracture toughness of blood clots and thrombi, thus providing a mechanistic basis for life-threatening thrombotic embolization. A combination of experiments, theoretical modeling and computer simulations will reveal how mechanical stresses (due to blood flow) in synergy with enzymatic lysis induce structural damage from the molecular to continuum scales and affect the propensity of a clot to embolize. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) Measure and model fracture toughness of fibrin gels in quasi-static conditions, (2) Investigate rate dependent dissipative effects on toughness of fibrin gels, and (3) Study the effects of blood cells, prothrombotic blood composition, and fibrinolysis on rupture of blood clots. In Specific Aim (SA) 1, we will measure toughness of fibrin clots and provide a structural basis for rupture at the micron and nanometer scales. In SA2, we will delve into the thermodynamics and rate-dependence of the fracture of fibrin gels, including fluid flow through pores and fluid drag on fibrin fibers to capture how energy dissipation increases toughness. In the translational SA3, we will investigate toughness of physiologically relevant clots with effects of platelets, red blood cells, and neutrophils in the absence and presence of the physiological fibrinolytic activator (tPA). We will also study the rupture of clots made from the blood of venous thromboembolism patients to explore the effects of (pro)thrombotic alterations of blood composition on clot mechanical stability. Our preliminary studies show that i) the toughness of cross-linked fibrin gels is in the range of those for synthetic hydrogels, ii) the addition of tPA to a crack tip reduces the loads for crack growth, iii) fibers are aligned and broken along the tensile direction at the crack tip, and iv) crack propagation results from the rupture of covalent and non-covalent bonds. We also developed v) dynamic force spectroscopy in silico to mechanically test fibrin fibers and fibrin networks using pulling simulations and vi) atomic stress approach to map the stress-strain fields using the output from simulations. We will use continuum and finite element models of swellable biopolymer hydrogels, and statistical mechanical models for the forced unfolding of fibrin molecules. We will employ multiscale computational modeling based on Molecular Dynamics simulations of atomic structures of fibrin fibers, and Langevin simulations of fibrin networks accelerated on Graphics Processing Units. The proposed experiments cover the whole gamut of macroscopic tensile tests, shear rheometry, electron microscopy and confocal microscopy to visualize and quantitate the structural alterations of ruptured blood clots. Our experiments and modeling will help us to understand the mechanisms of thrombotic embolization and will address the clinically important question: why is there a strong association between clot structure/mechanical properties and cardiovascular diseases? The new knowledge will also help to design new hydrogel-based biomaterials that are currently at the forefront of research in mechanics, materials science and bioengineering.

"Advancing evolutionary genetic inference in humans and other taxa Project Summary/Abstract Background: A major challenge in evolutionary genomics is to characterize the forces shaping present-day patterns of genetic variation. For instance, the extent and manner in which natural selection affects genetic diversity remains highly controversial. Researchers have largely addressed this problem by developing statistical tests or summaries of genome sequence variation that provide insights into the evolutionary forces at play. However, because such approaches typically rely on a single univariate summary of the data, valuable discriminatory information present in the original dataset is lost. A more fruitful strategy would thus be to use multidimensional summaries of genomic data (e.g. a large vector of summary statistics) or even the totality of the input data (e.g. a matrix-representation of a sequence alignment) to make more accurate inferences. An even more powerful approach is to utilize data sets in which the same population is sampled at multiple time points, allowing one to observe evolutionary dynamics in action. Although such genomic time-series data are becoming more prevalent, the development of appropriate computational methodologies has lagged behind the proliferation of such data. Proposal: The Schrider Lab seeks to develop and apply powerful machine learning methods for evolutionary inference. Our work over the next five years will yield powerful software tools leveraging novel representations of genomic datasets, including time-series data. These efforts will dramatically improve researchers' ability to make accurate evolutionary inferences from both population genomic and phylogenetic data. Indeed, preliminary results demonstrate that our methods vastly outperform current approaches in evolutionary genetics. More importantly, we will use these tools to answer pressing evolutionary questions. In particular, our use of time-series data will reveal loci responsible for recent adaptation with much greater confidence than currently possible. Our efforts will help to resolve the controversy over the role of adaptation in shaping patterns of diversity across the human genome. This research has important implications for public health as well, as genes underlying recent adaptations are enriched for disease-associations. Moreover, we are constructing a time-series dataset in the mosquito vector species Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. We will interrogate these data for evidence of recent and ongoing adaptation—this work will reveal loci responsible for the evolution of resistance to insecticides and other control efforts. Encouraging preliminary data also suggest that our work in phylogenetics will substantially improve inferential power in this important research area. More broadly, the success of the novel approaches described in this proposal has the potential to transform the methodological landscape of evolutionary genomic data analysis. Project Narrative The work proposed here seeks to develop and apply powerful machine-learning based software tools for evolutionary genetic inference in humans, mosquito vectors, and other species. Such efforts have important health implications, as they can identify genes involved in adaptation, which in humans are often associated with disease and in mosquitos are often associated with resistance to insecticides and other control efforts.",Advancing evolutionary genetic inference in humans and other taxa,10207692,R35GM138286,"['Aedes ', ' Affect ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Evolution ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Insecticides ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Culicidae ', ' Mosquitoes ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' Sequence Alignment ', ' sequencing alignment ', ' Natural Selections ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' insight ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pattern ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Phylogenetic Analysis ', ' Phylogenetics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' vector mosquito ', ' vector ', ' time use ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Population ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R35,2021,382894,NC-04
"Computational Analysis of Enzyme Catalysis and Regulation Project Summary: It is of great fundamental and biomedical importance to understand the physical princi- ples that govern the coupling between the chemical step in a biomolecule and other events, such as penetration of water molecules into the active site, recruitment of transient metal ions, or conformational rearrangements near and afar. This is a challenging task, however, due to the intrinsic multi-scale nature of the problem. As a result, our understanding in factors that dictate the efﬁciency and speciﬁcity of enzyme catalysis remains in- complete, especially regarding contributions beyond the active site; this knowledge gap has greatly limited our ability to design highly efﬁcient enzymes de novo. Motivated by these considerations, the overarching theme of our research is to develop and apply multi-scale computational methods to reveal the underlying mechanism of enzyme catalysis at an atomic level, with a particular emphasis on establishing to what degree the chem- ical step is coupled with other processes proximal or distal to the active site. Speciﬁcally, we aim to develop an efﬁcient QM/MM framework to compute free energy proﬁles of enzyme reactions with a good balance of computational speed and accuracy; further integration with enhanced sampling approaches, machine learning techniques and modern computational hardwares enables us to gain insights into the nature of coupling be- tween the chemical step and other events during the functional cycle. Accordingly, we are in a unique position to pursue several lines of exciting applications, which include the mechanism and impact of transient metal ion recruiting in nucleic acid processing enzymes, the catalytic and regulatory mechanism of peripheral membrane enzymes, and systemic analysis of allosteric coupling in a transcription factor; an emerging research direction is to explore the interplay of stability, catalytic activity, and allostery during continuous directed evolution. Our project integrates computational method developments with applications inspired by recent experimental ad- vances, such as time-resolved crystallography, deep mutational scanning and continuous directed evolution. The research efforts will lead to novel computational tools and mechanistic insights into the regulatory mech- anisms of enzymes by processes either near or remote from the active site. Thus the project will have both fundamental impacts and implications for better design strategies for catalysis and allostery in biomolecules.

"Mouse Models of Human Cancer Database PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The laboratory mouse is the preeminent animal model system for investigation into the biology and genetics of human cancer. Mouse models have provided key insights into cancer susceptibility, the molecular genetics of tumor suppressor and oncogenes, and therapy response in pre-clinical and co-clinical studies. Human tumors engrafted into immune compromised and humanized mice (aka, Patient Derived Xenografts) are playing an increasingly important role as a powerful preclinical platform for testing new cancer treatments. The Mouse Models of Human Cancer (MMHC) database is a unique on-line compendium of mouse models for human cancer. MMHCdb provides electronic access to expertly curated and harmonized information on diverse mouse models for human cancer along with tools for accessing and visualizing associated data from these models. This in turn, facilitates the selection of appropriate strains of mice for cancer genetics research. MMHCdb integrates data derived from peer-reviewed literature and from direct submissions from researchers. Data in MMHCdb are also obtained from other bioinformatics resources including PathBase, HUGO Human Gene Nomenclature database, the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and ArrayExpress. In this proposal we describe our plans for the continued development of MMHCdb with an emphasis on expanded support for analysis of tumor genomic data and drug response data from Patient Derived Xenograft models. To accomplish these goals we will build on successful collaborations to develop data standards for PDX models that are now widely adopted. The major goals for the project renewal include the following: · continue to populate MMHCdb with data on strain-specific patterns of tumorigenesis in inbred, mutant, and  genetically engineered mice, · leverage collaborations with Seven Bridges and PDXNet to analyze genomic data for PDX models using a  common analysis pipeline, · develop a platform for the analysis of PDX genomic and drug response data, and · support the infrastructure of MMHCdb and our user community through ongoing database maintenance,  development of new software components, user support services, and community outreach activities.

"Digital behavioral phenotyping and multi-region electrophysiology to determine behavioral and neural network changes underlying the stress response in mice ABSTRACT: Chronic psychological stress triggers and exacerbates major depressive disorder (MDD) and many other psychiatric conditions – causing changes in sleep, eating habits, addictive behaviors, activity levels, circadian rhythms, mood and other domains. The rodent stress response shares many behavioral and physiologic alterations with that of humans. Chronic stress also has broad effects on the brain. But major gaps exist in our knowledge in regard to the integrated behavior and physiology as well as the corresponding brain circuit changes with chronic stress. Prior work has found many behavioral and physiologic phenotypes of stress, but we lack a cohesive sense of how these variables co-evolve over time. Our first aim is to delineate this co-evolution of stress response elements in stressed versus unstressed mice. We will accomplish this by examining mice under a chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) paradigm versus controls in our new naturalistic observation system the “Digital Homecage”. This system allows us to monitor over 50 behavioral measures simultaneously over weeks. Mice will live in these homecages for 8 weeks: 2 weeks baseline, 4 weeks CUS and 2 weeks of recovery. An exploratory element of that aim is to use machine learning to determine a coherent mouse stress biomarker for future quantitative studies. Our next goal is to determine electrophysiologic signatures of chronic stress. It is known that chronic stress alters brain circuit synaptic structure and neuromodulatory balance. It is known that the behavior is controlled by the electrophysiologic state of brain networks and that those networks operate both locally within regions and via coordinated multi-regional transmission. Therefore, we aim to study changes in electrophysiology both within and across regions. We focus on the medial prefrontal cortex, the ventral hippocampus and infralimbic medial prefrontal cortex given their strong involvement in chronic stress. We will implant tetrode arrays into these regions and will record over 8 weeks as above. In Aim 2, we will determine the effects of chronic stress on within-region spiking tendencies including spike rate variability and excitatory- inhibitory balance. In a second part of this aim we will use machine learning applied to a wider variety of within- region dynamical measures to determine a potentially more complete set of differences between CUS and control mice. In our final Aim, we will assess cross-regional coordination between these 3 regions. We will test the hypothesis that pairwise coupling between regions will be altered in a manner consistent with MDD by measuring coupling using both spiking and LFP. Again, we will then use machine learning methods on our large dataset to detect further inter-regional dynamics un-revealed in our hypothesis-driven testing. This mixture of behavior and electrophysiology is done to generate new understanding about chronic stress. We also have a long-term vision of creating large dataset for future analysis, a fully-refined Digital Homecage system for future studies, with an eye towards developing interventions based on natural electrophysiologic circuit function. PROJECT NARRATIVE Stress has a central role in mental health conditions and improved understanding of how stress affects brain and body could deliver great potential clinical impact. To determine the brain and body responses to varying stressors we will use novel instrumentation to measure 50+ behavioral metrics at sub-second resolution together with multi-brain site electrophysiology over weeks. We will then determine how varying stressors affect circadian and broader changes across animal behavior and physiology as well as neural circuit dynamics.",Digital behavioral phenotyping and multi-region electrophysiology to determine behavioral and neural network changes underlying the stress response in mice,10199475,R01MH126137,"['Affect ', ' Antidepressive Agents ', ' Antidepressant Agent ', ' Antidepressant Drugs ', ' Antidepressants ', ' anti-depressant agent ', ' anti-depressant drugs ', ' anti-depressants ', ' anti-depressive agents ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Behavior ', ' Animal Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Biology ', ' Body Temperature ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Circadian Rhythms ', ' Nyctohemeral Rhythm ', ' Twenty-Four Hour Rhythm ', ' circadian process ', ' daily biorhythm ', ' Communication ', ' Decision Making ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Elements ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Evolution ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grooming ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' instrumentation ', ' Ketamine ', ' Libraries ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Moods ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Nucleus Accumbens ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Play ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sleep ', ' REM Sleep ', ' Fast-Wave Sleep ', ' Paradoxical Sleep ', ' Rhombencephalic Sleep ', ' dreaming sleep ', ' rapid eye movement sleep ', ' Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Sucrose ', ' Saccharose ', ' Suggestion ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Addictive Behavior ', ' Diet Habits ', ' Dietary Habits ', ' eating habit ', ' Mediating ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' stress response ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Anhedonia ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Medial ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Recovery ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' preference ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' stressor ', ' cohesion ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Response Elements ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' actigraph ', ' actigraphy ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Monitor ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Behavior monitoring ', ' behavioral monitoring ', ' digital ', ' Coupled ', ' Coupling ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Implant ', ' data structure ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' hands-on learning ', ' applied learning ', ' interactive engagement ', ' interactive learning ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' Data Science ', ' neural network ', ' circadian ', ' forced swim test ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' behavioral phenotyping ', ' behavior phenotype ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,681455,MI-12
"Clinical, imaging, and endoscopic outcomes of children newly diagnosed with Crohn's disease Project Summary/Abstract Therapeutic goals in pediatric Crohn’s Disease (CD) have shifted from clinical improvement or remission to endoscopic healing (EH) by ileocolonoscopy and transmural healing (TH) by magnetic resonance enterography (MRE). This shift happened because patients who achieve complete healing (CH, TH and EH) experience lower rates of subsequent hospitalization, therapy escalation, or surgery than those with EH alone or no healing. We hypothesize that specific pre-treatment clinical, radiologic, genomic, and microbial factors along with attainment of targeted anti-TNF biologic exposure will be associated with the primary endpoint, CH, and the major secondary endpoints, EH and TH, 52 weeks after anti-TNF start.. We will test this hypothesis in a prospective cohort study of 570 newly diagnosed pediatric-onset CD subjects who initiate treatment with anti-TNF medication within 6 months of diagnosis. We will administer personalized anti-TNF biologic therapy guided by therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) using a novel dosing algorithm which we developed. Aim 1. Evaluate putative associations and explore novel associations between CH and baseline measures of clinical and radiologic severity. We hypothesize that pre-treatment nutritional status, antimicrobial serologies, and MRE findings will be associated with CH 52 weeks after anti-TNF start. Formal hypothesis tests will be carried out to confirm the predictive power of a set of pre-specified measures using a logistic regression model. We will also conduct exploratory analyses of novel predictors, identified via machine learning methods, to assess their relationship with CH after adjusting for the confirmed primary predictors. Aim 2. Evaluate putative associations and explore novel associations between CH and baseline host and microbial genomic and metabolic factors. We hypothesize that pre-treatment gene expression signatures and microbial factors will be associated with year 1 CH. We will characterize the host genotype, longitudinal microbial taxonomic and metabolomic profiles, and ileal and colon host epigenome and transcriptome at baseline and at 52 weeks after anti-TNF start. Aim 3. Use a k-fold cross-validation procedure to determine the optimal predictive model of year 1 CH. We hypothesize that a model which includes host gene signatures and microbes will improve prediction of CH beyond one based on clinical and imaging factors alone. The model will include significant clinical and imaging predictors from Aim 1 and the subset of baseline host and microbial characteristics found to be potentially explanatory in Aim 2. Impact. The proposed inception cohort study, CAMEO, will be unique in providing a robust, novel platform to study factors that contribute to healing in pediatric CD that can then be immediately translated into clinical practice, as well as guiding future therapies targeting the microbiota and host immune responses in patients unlikely to achieve healing with current approaches.

"Dissecting drug resistance in serial uveal melanoma biopsies using integrated, multi-modal single-cell profiling and novel machine learning tools. PROJECT SUMMARY Uveal melanoma (UM) is a rare melanoma subtype with an estimated annual incidence of approximately 2000 in the United States. While most patients have excellent rates of local disease control with surgery or radiotherapy, nearly half develop metastatic disease, most frequently to the liver. Metastatic UM (MUM) is very treatment resistant and shows no significant responses to conventional chemotherapies or immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). UM is molecularly characterized by canonical mutations of the Gα protein subunits (GNAQ/11), which result in hyperactivation of the MAPK pathway. Targeting this pathway with MEK inhibitors (MEKi) results in significant anti-tumor activity in vitro, and response rates of up to 14% in patients with MUM, thereby exhibiting significantly higher activity compared to other available systemic therapies. However, there remains significant potential to improve the efficacy of MEKi. To better define modifiers of MEKi sensitivity and resistance, it is important to consider the fact that most UM harbor mutually exclusive GNAQ/11co-mutations, including inactivating mutations or bi-allelic loss of BAP1 (~33%) or deleterious mutations in SF3B1 (~23%) or EIF1AX (13%), thus define distinct genomic subtypes of UM. These alterations likely provide dependencies that are not abrogated with MEKi alone, yet they may represent synthetic lethal vulnerabilities in the context of MEKi. Furthermore, there has not been a systematic evaluation of how MEKi (or any other therapy) alters cancer cell autonomous and cell non-autonomous mechanisms that could confer drug resistance. This is in part due to technical barriers and lack of in vivo models that faithfully recapitulate human MUM. In this proposal, we build on several innovations to systematically determine the impact of MEKi on the MUM ecosystem and define synthetic lethal dependencies across the UM genomic landscape and in the context of MEKi. We will achieve this in two specifim aims: In Aim 1, we will perform single-nuclei RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) in patients with MUM who underwent therapy with MEKi selumetinib and had serial biopsies (pre-, on- and off-therapy), and analyze these with several established analytical methods. Second, building on recent developments, we will build machine learning tools for the analysis of sequential single-cell data sets. In Aim 2, we will perform patient- informed CRISPR-screens with multi-modal single-cell RNA/protein readouts across the genomic spectrum of UM. Finally, we will perform genome-scale CRISPR-screens across multiple models to define genotype-shared and -unique modifiers of MEKi responses. Together, these approaches will provide the a comprehensive sequential single-cell analysis in solid tumors, develop tools for temporal single-cell analyses that can be referenced against a ground truth, and define genotype-dependent synthetic lethal vulnerabilities with concurrent MEKi therapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Uveal melanoma (UM) is a rare form of melanoma that metastasizes in 50% of affected patients, which is associated with treatment resistance poor survival. There is currently no Food-and-Drug-Administration (FDA)- approved therapy for patients with metastatic UM, but MEK inhibitors (MEKi) are promising. Here, we will use a broad spectrum of single-cell genomic, genome-editing and machine-learning tools to define drug resistance to MEKi and potential synthetic lethal vulnerabilities across the distinct genomic landscape of UM.","Dissecting drug resistance in serial uveal melanoma biopsies using integrated, multi-modal single-cell profiling and novel machine learning tools.",10290692,R21CA263381,"['Affect ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Biopsy ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cues ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA Damage ', ' DNA Injury ', ' Drug resistance ', ' drug resistant ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' Evolution ', ' Exhibits ', ' Freezing ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Maintenance ', ' melanoma ', ' Malignant Melanoma ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' Metastasis ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastatic Lesion ', ' Metastatic Mass ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Proteins ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' radio-therapy ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Splicing ', ' Small Nuclear RNA ', ' Low Molecular Weight Nuclear RNA ', ' Small Molecular Weight RNA ', ' snRNA ', ' uRNA ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' USFDA ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Uveal Melanoma ', ' Intraocular Melanoma ', ' uvea melanoma ', ' Evaluation ', ' Cutaneous ', ' Metastatic Melanoma ', ' Solid Neoplasm ', ' Solid Tumor ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Dependence ', ' Allelic Loss ', ' Loss of Heterozygosity ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' BRCA 1/2 ', ' BRCA1/2 ', ' brca gene ', ' experience ', ' single cell analysis ', ' Protein Subunits ', ' novel ', ' MEKs ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' disease control ', ' disorder control ', ' Pharmacogenomics ', ' GAQ ', ' GNAQ ', ' GNAQ gene ', ' Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase Gene ', ' MAPK ', ' Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Gene ', ' MAP Kinase Gene ', ' Data ', ' Melanoma Cell ', ' Mutate ', ' Systemic Therapy ', ' SYS-TX ', ' in vivo Model ', ' MAPK Signaling Pathway Pathway ', ' MAPK Signaling Pathway ', ' Molecular ', ' resistance mechanism ', ' resistant mechanism ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' preclinical study ', ' pre-clinical study ', ' therapy resistant ', ' resistance to therapy ', ' resistant to therapy ', ' therapeutic resistance ', ' treatment resistance ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' combinatorial ', ' chemotherapy ', ' loss of function ', ' tumor ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' in vitro activity ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' genome editing ', ' genomic editing ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' molecular subtypes ', ' expression subtypes ', ' molecular sub-types ', ' molecular subsets ', ' mutational status ', ' mutation status ', ' CRISPR screen ', ' CRISPR editing screen ', ' CRISPR-based screen ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 screen ', ' clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats screen ', ' Immune checkpoint inhibitor ', ' Checkpoint inhibitor ', ' immune check point inhibitor ', ' ']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2021,189338,NY-13
"Symmetry Breaking and Collective Cell Growth in Drosophila Oogenesis PROJECT SUMMARY In many studied animal species, including mammals, the future oocyte develops within a cluster of cells that exchange molecules and organelles through a network of cytoplasmic bridges, which are formed by stabilized and reinforced cytokinetic furrows. While the formation and structure of this interesting class of multicellular systems has been extensively studied, their dynamics is poorly understood, leaving many critical questions about oocyte determination and development unanswered. I will investigate two of these questions in Drosophila, an experimental model that continues to provide valuable insights into general mechanisms of animal oogenesis. Using experimental, modeling, and computational approaches, I will investigate how one cell within the germline cell cluster is chosen to be the future oocyte and how the germline cell cluster comprising the oocyte and supporting nurse cells grows during development. Specifically, Aim 1 is designed to evaluate the differential contributions of the prepatterning and self-organizing mechanisms of oocyte determination. Focusing on the fusome, a membranous structure that is essential for intercellular communication in early oogenesis, and on a recently discovered positive feedback loop involving mRNA localization and translation, I will establish data- driven mathematical models for oocyte selection. In parallel, Aim 2 will investigate growth of the oocyte and supporting cells, using the germline cluster as a tractable system for exploring how the scaling laws established by studies of single cell growth are altered when cells grow together.

"Statistical and Machine Learning Methods to Address Biomedical Challenges for Integrating Multi-view Data Project Summary Many diseases are complex, heterogeneous, conditions that affect multiple organs in the body and depend on the interplay between several factors that include genetic, cellular, molecular, and environmental factors. It is therefore not surprising that the pathogenesis of many complex diseases remain elusive, and therapeutic targets are lacking. The traditional approach that focus on a small number of molecules (e.g., genes or metabolites) or a single type of data (e.g., clinical or genetic) cannot address this complexity and heterogeneity. Integrative or systems biology approaches and network analysis can be used to leverage the strengths of data from multiple sources (e.g., genomics, metabolomics, epidemiology, clinical data) to achieve new insights into the pathobiology of complex diseases. Recent technological advances have enabled the production of vast amounts of diverse but related data with rich information that offer remarkable opportunities to understand biological processes involved in complex diseases and to transform medicine, yet at the same time present signiﬁcant analytical challenges including how to effectively synthesize information from the tens of thousands of data points to identify important biomarkers with potential to serve as therapeutic targets. To alleviate this, we will develop and apply a suite of novel, robust, and powerful statistical and machine learning methods for the integration and interpretation of cross-sectional and longitudinal data from multiple sources. These models will also be used to deﬁne subpopulations of patients who have different prognoses or require different therapeutic approaches based on data from different sources. Further, we will make use of recent advances in network theory to model the complex multilateral relationships in molecular data from multiple sources. The proposed methods will be applied to several publicly available datasets and cohorts to ensure that we can generalize our work to other datasets and cohorts and thus increase the long-term impact of our research. The proposed research will also contribute valuable statistical and machine learning algorithms that will be broadly applicable to data from multiple sources and multiple cohorts and will be made available to the public free of charge. Project Narrative This proposed research is expected to lay the foundation for advances in disease diagnosis, treatment, and personalized care through the integration and interpretation of cross-sectional and longitudinal data from multiple sources; it will contribute valuable tools and methods with potential for identiﬁcation of novel molecular targets for therapeutic interventions and for discovery of novel disease subtypes for improved patient prognosis.",Statistical and Machine Learning Methods to Address Biomedical Challenges for Integrating Multi-view Data,10274846,R35GM142695,"['Affect ', ' Charge ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Production ', ' Research ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' disease subgroups ', ' disease subtype ', ' disorder subtype ', ' Genomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Address ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Molecular ', ' therapeutic target ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' personalized care ', ' Precision care ', ' individualized care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' molecular targeted therapies ', ' molecular targeted therapeutics ', ' molecular targeted treatment ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' multiple data sources ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R35,2021,351514,MN-05
"Evolution-guided machine learning for inferring natural selection Project Summary/Abstract A fundamental question in genomics is to understand natural selection on coding and noncoding sequences. Signatures of natural selection encoded in polymorphism and divergence data not only elucidate the patterns of evolution but also pinpoint deleterious genetic variants responsible for genetic disorders. While numerous com- putational methods have been developed to infer sequences under various types of natural selection, the existing methods suffer from two critical limitations. First, most of the methods for inferring natural selection focus on an- alyzing individual loci. Due to the intrinsic sparsity of polymorphism and divergence data, the single-locus-based approaches are often underpowered. Second, when multiple genomic features are correlated with signatures of natural selection, the existing methods are incapable of distinguishing causal genomic features from corre- lated confounders. Due to these limitations, we still lack powerful computational frameworks to identify loci and genomic features responsible for natural selection. During the next ﬁve years, l will address the limitations of exist- ing methods by combining evolutionary models and ﬂexible machine learning techniques. Speciﬁcally, I formulate the inference of natural selection as a special regression problem in which genomic features are input covariates whereas polymorphism and divergence data are response variables. Based on this idea, my lab will develop a suite of evolution-guided machine learning models to infer negative, positive, and lineage-speciﬁc selection. These customized machine learning models will boost the statistical power of selection inference by pooling data across large numbers of loci, and will be able to distinguish genomic determinants from confounders. These new models will be applied to investigate various types of natural selection in the human genome. In addition, a genome-wide map of deleterious variants under strong negative selection will be developed for accurate variant prioritization. The proposed research builds on my recent work for predicting functional noncoding sequences, inferring selection coefﬁcients of coding variants, and unifying variant-level and gene-level prioritization methods. It will illustrate new insights into genomic determinants of functional sequences and human adaptive evolution, and will provide powerful computational tools for identifying disease mutations. It could also serve as a basis for the emerging paradigm of combining classical evolutionary theory and machine learning methods to address a variety of questions in evolutionary biology. Project Narrative Natural selection is a fundamental force of evolution and a hallmark of functional sequences. However, it is challenging to identify loci and genomic features responsible for natural selection due to the intrinsic sparsity of polymorphism and divergence data at a single locus. By combining evolutionary models and machine learning techniques, we can infer loci under natural selection at an unprecedented resolution, distinguish genomic deter- minants of natural selection from confounders, and accurately identify pathogenic variants from the footprints of negative selection.",Evolution-guided machine learning for inferring natural selection,10273742,R35GM142560,"['Biology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Evolution ', ' Genes ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Research ', ' Work ', ' Natural Selections ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' genetic condition ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Data Pooling ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIGMS,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R35,2021,373274,PA-12

"Fast and flexible Bayesian phylogenetics via modern machine learning Project Abstract/Summary The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic underlines both our susceptibility to and the toll of a global pathogen outbreak. Phylogenetic analysis of viral genomes provides key insight into disease pathophysiology, spread and po- tential control. However, if these methods are to be used in a viral control strategy they must reliably account for uncertainty and be able to perform inference on 1,000s of genomes in actionable time. Scaling Bayesian phylogenet- ics to meet this need is a grand challenge that is unlikely to be met by optimizing existing algorithms.  We will meet this challenge with a radically new approach: Bayesian variational inference for phylogenet- ics (VIP) using ﬂexible distributions on phylogenetic trees that are ﬁt using gradient-based methods analogous to how one efﬁciently trains massive neural networks. By taking a variational approach we will also be able to integrate phylogenetic analysis into very powerful open-source modeling frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. This will open up new classes of models, such as neural network models, to integrate data such as sampling location and migration patterns with phylogenetic inference. These ﬂexible models will inform strategies for viral control.  In Aim 1 we will develop the theory necessary for scalable and reliable VIP, including subtree marginal- ization, local gradient updates needed for online algorithms, convergence diagnostics, and parameter support estimates. We will implement these algorithms in our C++ foundation library for VIP. In Aim 2 we will develop a ﬂexible TensorFlow-based modeling platform for phylogenetics, enabling a whole new realm of phylogenetic models based on neural networks to learn phylodynamic heterogeneity with minimal program- ming effort. We will provide efﬁcient gradients to this implementation via our C++ library. In Aim 3 we will use the fact that VIP posteriors are durable and extensible descriptions of the full data posterior to enable dynamic online computation of variational posteriors, including divide-and-conquer Bayesian phylogenetics. This work will enable a cloud-based viral phylogenetics solution to rapidly update our current estimate of the posterior distribution when new data arrive or the model is modiﬁed. 1 Project Narrative We have seen in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, as for all major pathogen outbreaks in the last decade, how phylogenetic (i.e. evolutionary tree) methods are required to use viral genomic information to under- stand large-scale transmission patterns. However, current phylogenetic methods have two major limitations as a tool for viral control: ﬁrst, rigorous Bayesian probabilistic methods cannot scale to 1,000s of genomes, and second, models incorporating phylogenetic trees must be expressed in specialized phylogenetics pack- ages, making modern machine-learning approaches impossible. In this proposal, we develop variational ap- proaches to phylogenetics, which will allow fast inference and procedures to rapidly update inferences when new data arrives, as well as making phylogenetic trees a ﬁrst-class inferential object in major machine-learning packages. 1",Fast and flexible Bayesian phylogenetics via modern machine learning,10266670,R01AI162611,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Epidemic ', ' Foundations ', ' Genome ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Structural Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Public Health ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Trees ', ' Viral Genome ', ' virus genome ', ' Work ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Discipline ', ' Bayesian Method ', ' Bayesian Methodology ', ' Bayesian Statistical Method ', ' Bayesian approaches ', ' Bayesian classification method ', ' Bayesian classification procedure ', ' Bayesian posterior distribution ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' computer biology ', ' Computational Biology ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Viral ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Structure ', ' Graph ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' theories ', ' Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms ', ' Markov chain Monte Carlo computational algorithm ', ' Markov chain Monte Carlo method ', ' Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure ', ' Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling ', ' Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation ', ' Markov chain Monte Carlo technique ', ' Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Phylogenetic Analysis ', ' Phylogenetics ', ' Update ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Modification ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' scale up ', ' pathogen ', ' migration ', ' user-friendly ', ' open source ', ' mathematical algorithm ', ' math algorithm ', ' mathematic algorithm ', ' epidemiologic data ', ' Epidemiological data ', ' Epidemiology data ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' mathematical methods ', ' math methodology ', ' math methods ', ' mathematical approach ', ' mathematical methodology ', ' mathematics approach ', ' mathematics methodology ', ' mathematics methods ', ' cloud based ', ' social exclusion ', ' marginalization ', ' viral transmission ', ' virus transmission ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' high dimensionality ', ' TensorFlow ', ' neural network ', ' viral genomics ', ' virus genomics ', ' COVID-19 pandemic ', ' COVID crisis ', ' COVID epidemic ', ' COVID pandemic ', ' COVID-19 crisis ', ' COVID-19 epidemic ', ' COVID-19 global health crisis ', ' COVID-19 global pandemic ', ' COVID-19 health crisis ', ' COVID-19 public health crisis ', ' COVID19 crisis ', ' COVID19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 global health crisis ', ' COVID19 global pandemic ', ' COVID19 health crisis ', ' COVID19 pandemic ', ' COVID19 public health crisis ', ' SARS-CoV-2 epidemic ', ' SARS-CoV-2 global health crisis ', ' SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic ', ' SARS-CoV-2 pandemic ', ' SARS-CoV2 epidemic ', ' SARS-CoV2 pandemic ', ' SARS-coronavirus-2 epidemic ', ' SARS-coronavirus-2 pandemic ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 epidemic ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 pandemic ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 epidemic ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 crisis ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 global health crisis ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 global pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 health crisis ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 public health crisis ', ' coronavirus disease crisis ', ' coronavirus disease epidemic ', ' coronavirus disease pandemic ', ' severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 global health crisis ', ' severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 global pandemic ', ' ']",NIAID,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2021,797370,WA-07
"Building protein structure models for intermediate resolution cryo-electron microscopy maps Project Summary Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is an emerging technique in structural biology, which is capable of determining three-dimensional (3D) structures of biological macromolecules. Compared to conventional structural biology techniques, such as X-ray crystallography and NMR, a major advantage of cryo-EM is its ability to solve large macromolecular assemblies. Moreover, recent technical breakthroughs in cryo-EM have enabled determination of 3D structures at nearly atomic-level resolutions. Cryo-EM will undoubtedly become a method of central importance in structural biology in the next decade. With the rapid accumulation of cryo-EM structure data, it has become crucial to develop computational methods that can effectively build and extract 3D structures of biological macromolecules from EM maps. The goal of this project is to develop computational methods for modeling both global and local structures and for interpreting 3D structures embedded in EM maps of around 4 Å to medium-resolution. Recently, we have developed a new de novo protein structure modeling method, MAINMAST, which can model protein structures from an EM density map without using existing template or fragment structures on the map. Based on the successful development of MAINMAST, we further extend the capability of MAINMAST toward more accurate modeling and for multiple-chain modeling. In addition, we will also develop novel modeling methods for medium-resolution EM maps, which combine a coarse-grained protein structure modeling technique, methods in protein structure prediction, and a low- resolution image processing approach with deep learning, a state-of-the-art powerful machine learning method. The proposed project capitalizes on the tremendous efforts and progress made in structural determination with cryo-EM by developing computational tools that allow researchers to perform efficient and reliable structure analyses for 3D EM density maps. The project will greatly facilitate investigation into the molecular mechanisms of macromolecule function by providing an efficient means of 3D structure modeling.

"Transcriptional Regulatory Networks of Craniofacial Development Abstract Human craniofacial development is a complex process and frequently goes awry to cause a major class of birth defects, orofacial clefting, which affects approximately 1 in 700 live births. Proper facial development in mouse and human requires three sets of paired facial prominences coming together by growth, morphogenesis, and fusion. Embryonic facial development is strikingly similar in human and mouse, making the mouse the best available model system for human. Previous studies have shown that the expression of many thousands of genes changes across tissue layer, age, and/or prominence, as well as cell population during early mouse facial development. However, we still only have a rudimentary understanding of how these changes are regulated by the interaction of transcriptional modulators in the developing face. To understand how genes are transcriptionally regulated during facial development, this research seeks to construct transcriptional regulatory networks in a temporospatial manner by in silico analysis of publicly available multi- omic datasets. Aim 1 will focus on the identification and verification of transcriptional regulatory networks operating in facial mesenchyme with a focus on super-enhancers. Aim 2 will adopt a similar approach to study the ectoderm which acts as a vital signaling center for the mesenchyme. Finally, in Aim 3 I will apply knowledge from Aims 1 and 2 to build transcriptional regulatory networks at the single cell level. These aims will take advantage of available RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, histone marker ChIP-seq, transcription factor ChIP-seq, bulk and single cell RNA-seq data from wild-type or mutant mice, as well as facial enhancer expression databases. Accomplishment of these studies will predict how genes are transcriptionally regulated in a temporospatial manner during facial development and discover sets of core transcription factors and super- enhancers controlling facial development. These transcriptional regulatory networks will be relevant to the genetic and molecular underpinnings of human orofacial clefting, and will provide clear testable predictions about transcription factor function and the consequences of aberrant expression. Performance and accomplishment of these Aims will also act as a major component of my career development plan, in which my goal is to obtain and independent tenure-track faculty position and serve as a mentor to the next generation of scientists. A major aspect of my career development plan is to build on my growing strength in bioinformatics by learning more advanced techniques in this specialty alongside new computational based approaches, such as machine learning. In this respect, my Aims and career development plan are aligned with a Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) of NIDCR in Supporting Dental, Oral, and Craniofacial Research Using Bioinformatic, Computational, and Data Science Approaches (NOT-DE-20-006) for which this application is targeted. I have recruited a mentorship team with specialties in craniofacial biology, bioinformatics, machine learning, and career development to help me achieve these goals. Project Narrative Human craniofacial development is a complex process and requires suites of genes to be switched on and off at appropriate times and spaces during formation of the embryo. There is now a wealth of data available in public databases concerning which genes are expressed when and where during mammalian facial development, including for the transcription factors which are the proteins that regulate these critical expression programs, but we have not yet begun to connect this information together to derive logical predictions about the critical networks responsible for craniofacial development. This proposal will address that gap using both computational and laboratory-based methods to derive and verify transcriptional regulatory networks relevant to the genetic and molecular underpinnings of normal facial development as well as how these are disrupted to cause defects such as human orofacial clefting.",Transcriptional Regulatory Networks of Craniofacial Development,10284443,K01DE030923,"['Congenital Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Malformation ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biology ', ' bone ', ' Cartilage ', ' Cartilaginous Tissue ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Ectoderm ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Histones ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Mutant Strains Mice ', ' mouse mutant ', ' Study models ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Genetic Models ', ' Morphogenesis ', ' morphogenetic process ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Pathology ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Enhancers ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Mesenchyme ', ' Mesenchymas ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Solid ', ' Dental ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Development Plans ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Oral ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Live Birth ', ' interest ', ' craniofacies ', ' craniofacial ', ' Performance ', ' transgenic ', ' Transgenic Organisms ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' career development ', ' Genomics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' Address ', ' Defect ', ' Data ', ' Mesenchymal ', ' NIDCR ', ' NIDR ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Validation ', ' Wild Type Mouse ', ' wildtype mouse ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Instruction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Computational Science ', ' Population ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' network models ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' critical period ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' FaceBase ', ' craniofacial development ', ' orofacial cleft ', ' orofacial clefting ', ' ATAC-seq ', ' ATACseq ', ' differential expression ', ' differentially expressed ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' tenure track ', ' tenure process ', ' Data Science ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' recruit ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' in silico ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K01,2021,130135,CO-06
"Developing statistical image analysis tools for non-invasive monitoring of anemia in low birth weight infants Project Summary Our proposal is motivated by the need to develop non-invasive tools for monitoring anemia in very low birth weight (VLBW; birth weight < 1,500 grams) and reduce the number of routine painful, invasive blood sampling procedures (phlebotomy) that may alter infant neurodevelopment and behavior. Recently, a new smartphone application [Mannino et al., Nature Communications, 9, 4924 (2018)] that collects and analyzes clinical pallor in patient-sourced fingernail photos and image metadata has been developed to predict hemoglobin levels. The app uses a robust multi-linear regression model that incorporates summary color intensity values (average across pixels) of fingernail photos well as the image metadata generated by the device capturing the image to predict patient's hemoglobin level. While the current app algorithm is simple and easy to implement, there are notable limitations. First, it does not fully leverage the rich spatial information available in fingernail photos by calculating a simple average value. Second, the current algorithm is trained using only adults, whose clinical characteristics are vastly different from infants. The 95% limit of agreement between the app-predicted and blood sample-based hemoglobin level for adults is reported as 2.4 g/dL, which is higher than the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments specification variance of 1.0 g/dL, and will likely increase in VLBW infants given their tiny, non-specific fingernail beds. Such strict error requirements and heterogeneity in populations demand more accurate and tailored algorithms than what the current app employs. Lastly, a framework for applying the app to minimize blood draws across the longitudinal care continuum for VLBW infants is currently lacking. With these considerations, we propose (Aim 1) to develop a new image analysis algorithm (IAA) that produces non-invasive, accurate and stable prediction of hemoglobin level. The IAA will be based on a novel principal component analysis method that provides a non-parametric and parsimonious means to jointly model high- dimensional photos and image metadata, while fully leveraging their spatial structures and co-varying patterns. We will also consider a new partial least squares approach as an alternative method. We will train and validate the IAA based on adult data as well as VLBW infant data. In Aim 2, we will develop a new clustering method to study sub-population structures of fingernail photos and image metadata and study their relationships with the underlying physiological mechanisms of anemia. This approach will allow us to formulate a non-invasive image- based screening tool by identifying clusters of VLBW infants with high anemia risk. In Aim 3, we will develop data-driven tools that leverage longitudinal, patient-level clinical data and IAA predictions to achieve the overarching clinical goal of minimizing the number of blood draws in VLBW infants throughout the care continuum. Our proposal will use the data of VLBW infants monitored at three level III neonatal intensive care units in Atlanta. The proposed methods are generally applicable to a wide variety of settings with diverse and complex modalities of clinical data. Project Narrative Anemia of prematurity occurs in nearly all very low birth weight (VLBW; birth weight < 1,500 grams) infants who survive the initial postnatal course, and its main cause is blood loss from routine phlebotomy for its diagnosis. The proposed research project will develop a new image analysis algorithm (IAA) that analyzes full structural information of clinical pallor in fingernail photos to enable accurate, non-invasive prediction of blood hemoglobin level and anemia risk among VLBW infants. We will develop various data-driven tools that leverage longitudinal, patient-specific clinical data and IAA predictions to achieve the overarching clinical goal of minimizing the number of invasive blood sampling procedures throughout the care continuum for VLBW infants.",Developing statistical image analysis tools for non-invasive monitoring of anemia in low birth weight infants,10279575,R01HL159213,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anemia ', ' Beds ', ' Behavior ', ' Birth Weight ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Color ', ' Communication ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complete Blood Count ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Hemoglobin concentration result ', ' hemoglobin level ', ' Hemoglobin ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hybrids ', ' Infant ', ' Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' low birth weight ', ' low birth weight infant human ', ' low birthweight ', ' Neonatal Intensive Care Units ', ' Newborn Intensive Care Units ', ' neonatal ICU ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Least-Squares Analysis ', ' Least Squares ', ' Least-Squares Analyses ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Methods ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Pallor ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Premature Birth ', ' Prematurely delivering ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' premature childbirth ', ' premature delivery ', ' preterm delivery ', ' base ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Venous blood sampling ', ' Phlebotomy ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Clinical ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Ensure ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Training ', ' Structure of nail of finger ', ' Finger Nail ', ' Fingernail ', ' Measurement ', ' noninvasive diagnosis ', ' non-invasive diagnosis ', ' non-invasive diagnostic ', ' noninvasive diagnostic ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Very Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' VLBW ', ' very low birth weight ', ' Inflammatory ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Principal Component Analyses ', ' Principal Component Analysis ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' postnatal ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Necrotizing Enterocolitis ', ' Performance ', ' user friendly computer software ', ' user friendly software ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' inflammatory disease of the intestine ', ' gut inflammation ', ' inflammatory disorder of the intestine ', ' intestinal autoinflammation ', ' intestinal inflammation ', ' infant monitoring ', ' infant measurement ', ' Population ', ' user-friendly ', ' non-invasive monitor ', ' noninvasive monitor ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' Algorithmic Analysis ', ' Algorithmic Analyses ', ' Analyses of Algorithms ', ' Analysis of Algorithms ', ' non-invasive imaging ', ' noninvasive imaging ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' high dimensionality ', ' recruit ', ' smartphone Application ', ' Android App ', ' Android Application ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smartphone App ', ' iOS app ', ' iOS application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iPhone Application ', ' postnatal period ', ' post-natal period ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' statistical learning ', ' Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments ', ' intestinal injury ', ' injury to the intestines ', ' ']",NHLBI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,546500,GA-05
"Robust, Generalizable, and Fair Machine Learning Models for Biomedicine Project Summary  Modern machine learning approaches have attained substantial success in pattern recognition and high-dimensional data analyses. However, these algorithms heavily rely on association discovery, which cannot elucidate the mechanisms underpinning the observed correlations and suffers from limited generalizability. To address this challenge, the Yu Lab focuses on the development of robust and generalizable machine learning approaches to integrate various types of biomedical data, including multi-omics, pathology, and phenotypic information. The goal of the next five years is to develop novel computational methods that connect machine learning algorithms with causal inference methodologies to better understand the molecular mechanisms underpinning disease pathology and enable fair and robust predictions of drug response and toxicity. The overall vision of the proposed research program is to establish generalizable data-driven methods to transform biomedical data into robust prediction and mechanistic models. The proposed approach will systematically connect diverse biomedical signals to extract previously unknown knowledge on the molecular mechanisms and derive reliable prediction models for the effects of medications. The proposed approaches are innovative because they depart from the status quo by incorporating advanced causal inference techniques with data-driven algorithms to enhance mechanistic and predictive modeling. This research program is significant because it is expected to improve our understanding of disease pathology and provide a fair and generalizable informatics framework for drug response and adverse effects prediction in diverse populations. The proposed research activities will open new research horizons by establishing a new machine learning platform for generating reliable predictions, which will vertically advance molecular biology, pharmacology, and computational research in biomedicine. Project Narrative  The research program outlined in this proposal is relevant to public health because it will establish novel machine learning algorithms for modeling the molecular mechanisms of pathologic changes, enable robust drug response prediction, and ensure the fairness and generalizability of the analytical methods for biomedical data.

"MusIC: A multi-scale technology for integrating dynamic cellular function and molecular profiles Our objective is develop and rigorously validate a transformative technology that integrates cellular functions/activities with their deep molecular signatures at single-cell resolution, in high-throughput. Immunotherapy has emerged as a highly effective approach for the treatment of human cancer, and works by harnessing the power of the immune system and its ability to recognize and eliminate cancer cells. Immunotherapy has distinct advantages, including: (i) sustained and durable responses; (ii) defined mechanisms of action; and (iii) higher specificity and fewer-off target effects than traditional approaches. Along with antibody immunotherapy, genetically engineering T cells for redirecting immune responses has recently received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. Adoptive cell therapy (ACT), based on infusing in vitro expanded T cells bearing either T-cell receptors (TCR), or chimeric antigen receptors (CAR), have demonstrated dramatic and durable responses, even in heavily pretreated patients. Despite these initial clinical successes, patient responses vary widely. Recent correlative data indicate that variability in the manufactured T cell products may be the primary determinant of clinical success. Since cellular infusion products are a heterogeneous mixture of cells, mapping the complexity of the population requires the ability to identify the function and molecular profiles of cells at single-cell resolution. There is an essential need for technologies that are able to map this complexity in T-cell functionality and being able to link function to molecular profiles at single-cell resolution. We propose the development and validation of Multiscale Intelligent Convergence (MusIC). MusIC will provide multi-scale data from molecules to subcellular dynamics to cell-cell interaction biology on the same cells across thousands of cells. Given the heterogeneity in the composition of cells being used for ACT, it serves as the ideal system for the development and validation of MusIC. Our team of investigators has expertise in single-cell technology development and immunotherapy, machine learning, and image analysis and data modeling. We anticipate that the successful implementation of this proposal will enable the validation of MusIC as a platform for studying multi-scale cell biology. This in turn, will lead to the more reliable biomanufacturing of T-cell infusion products, and the engineering of more potent immune cells can have a broad impact on immunotherapy. We propose to develop and validate a technology for the multi-scale profiling of cells at the single-cell level. We anticipate that this technology will fundamentally alter the characterization of immune cells in the context of immunotherapy and vaccines.",MusIC: A multi-scale technology for integrating dynamic

"Spatial Regulators of Skeletal Muscle Regeneration and Disease Skeletal muscles are responsible for movement, breathing, posture and metabolism. Loss of muscle function via acute injury or chronic neuromuscular disease (NMD) is debilitating to quality of life and is associated with high healthcare burden. In the US, there are over 12 million cases of sprains and strains injuries each year, an estimated 50 million people living with age-related sarcopenia, and another 250,000 with NMDs. My long-term goal is to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms which underlie the muscle repair and develop therapies for chronic muscle disorders. A major barrier in this endeavor is our limited of understanding of the multiplicity of cell types involved during muscle regeneration. Little is known regarding functions of each cell type and how they interact with tissue-resident stem cells to regulate the restoration of muscle function. Thus, tissue cytometry, the mapping of single cells within tissues, is necessary to gain novel insights into cellular interactions during muscle regeneration and in dysregulated disease states. My central hypothesis is that local signaling in the cellular microenvironment regulate the behavior of critical cell types to remodel or repair the tissue. To this, I have optimized a novel multiplexed imaging technology (CODEX) that enables visualizes 40+ antibodies on a single muscle section. In the proposed research, I aim to (i) develop technologies to study cellular interactions using high dimensional imaging data and build a single cell resolution spatial map of the localization, abundance, dynamics, and interactions of 25 cell type within normal muscle regeneration and disease states; (ii) elucidate critical cell types and spatially-localized signaling that determine the proper expansion and differentiation of muscle stem cells; (iii) deep profile the function of M2 macrophages and fibroadipogenic precursors in process of motor neuron and neuromuscular junction remodeling. The training I will receive during the mentored phase of this proposal will be critical for the success of this project. Moreover, application of this systematic approach to study inter-cellular signaling will allow me to achieve academic independence. The proposed experiments in the K99 phase will provide novel insights into the coordinated process of tissue regeneration and will yield candidate signaling molecules with the potential to modulate the function of muscle stem cells. Further, the proposed project for the R00 phase will lead to better understanding of the cellular responses and fundamental mechanisms of motor neuron and neuromuscular junction remodeling, which has significant relevance for nerve injuries and chronic autoimmune neuromuscular diseases. Loss of muscle function in chronic neuromuscular disease (NMD) is debilitating to quality of life and is associated with high healthcare burden. A major barrier in the development of effective therapies for NMDs is our limited of understanding of the various types of cells involved in normal muscle repair and what goes awry in disease. Here, I develop novel technologies to simultaneously visualize and study the interaction of more than 25 cell types in skeletal muscle, which will allow us to uncover critical interactions that determine efficient muscle regeneration as well as pinpoint disruptions in chronic NMD.",Spatial Regulators of Skeletal Muscle Regeneration and Disease,10271399,K99NS120278,"['Algorithms ', ' Antibodies ', ' Breathing ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' inspiration ', ' Autoimmune Responses ', ' Autoimmunity ', ' Autoimmune Status ', ' Behavior ', ' Biology ', ' Cell Communication ', ' Cell Interaction ', ' Cell-to-Cell Interaction ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Denervation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' In Vitro ', ' Ligands ', ' macrophage ', ' Mφ ', ' Maps ', ' Mentors ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methods ', ' Motor Neurons ', ' Motor Cell ', ' motoneuron ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Muscular Atrophy ', ' Muscle Atrophy ', ' muscle breakdown ', ' muscle degradation ', ' muscle deterioration ', ' muscle loss ', ' muscle wasting ', ' Myopathy ', ' Muscle Disease ', ' Muscle Disorders ', ' Muscular Diseases ', ' Myopathic Conditions ', ' Myopathic Diseases and Syndromes ', ' Myopathic disease or syndrome ', ' muscular disorder ', ' Myasthenia Gravis ', ' Nerve ', ' Nerve Crush ', ' Neuroglia ', ' Glia ', ' Glial Cells ', "" Kolliker's reticulum "", ' Neuroglial Cells ', ' Non-neuronal cell ', ' Nonneuronal cell ', ' nerve cement ', ' Neuromuscular Diseases ', ' myoneural disorder ', ' neuromuscular degenerative disorder ', ' neuromuscular disorder ', ' Neuromuscular Junction ', ' Myoneural Junction ', ' Posture ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Natural regeneration ', ' Regeneration ', ' regenerate ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' sciatic nerve ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Sprains and Strains ', ' Standardization ', ' stem cells ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Technology ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' nerve injury ', ' neural injury ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' repaired ', ' repair ', ' Phase ', ' mdx mouse ', ' Training ', ' Muscle function ', ' reinnervation ', ' reinnervate ', ' insight ', ' Skeletal Muscle ', ' Voluntary Muscle ', ' Muscle Fibers ', ' Myotubes ', ' Rhabdomyocyte ', ' Skeletal Fiber ', ' Skeletal Muscle Cell ', ' Skeletal Muscle Fiber ', ' Skeletal Myocytes ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Collaborations ', ' programs ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' cell type ', ' restoration ', ' Myocytes ', ' Muscle Cells ', ' myogenesis ', ' success ', ' muscle progenitor cell ', ' muscle stem cell ', ' Muscle satellite cell ', ' novel ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Experimental Myasthenia ', ' Experimental Myasthenia Gravis ', ' Experimental Autoimmune Myasthenia Gravis ', ' Cytometry ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' sarcopenic ', ' sarcopenia ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Cell to Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell-Cell Signaling ', ' intercellular communication ', ' B220 ', ' CD45 ', ' GP180 ', ' LY5 ', ' PTPRC ', ' T200 ', ' PTPRC gene ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Signaling Molecule ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' tissue regeneration ', ' regenerate new tissue ', ' regenerate tissue ', ' regenerating damaged tissue ', ' regenerating tissue ', ' tissue renewal ', ' tissue specific regeneration ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' neuromuscular ', ' muscle regeneration ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Population ', ' transcriptomics ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' progenitor ', ' therapy development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' strain injury ', ' tissue repair ', ' connectome ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' high dimensionality ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' multiplexed imaging ', ' stem cell function ', ' progenitor cell function ', ' Autoimmune ', ' ']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,88722,CA-18
"MUFA-SIRT1 signaling as a central node regulating healthspan PROJECT SUMMARY Macronutrients serve a multitude of roles beyond provision of energy, with numerous nutrients and/or their downstream metabolites acting as signaling molecules to coordinate cellular metabolism and function. Indeed, numerous nutrient sensing pathways (e.g. mTOR, AMPK and sirtuins) have evolved allowing us to respond to specific nutrients/metabolites, which in turn impacts healthspan. Sirtuins are largely thought to be driven by redox, whereby high levels of NAD, a cofactor in the sirtuin reaction and indicator of low energy charge, drives sirtuin-catalyzed deacylation of target proteins. SIRT1, the most-studied sirtuin, is a key nutrient sensing node that regulates a plethora of cellular functions to promote lifespan extension and healthy aging. As a result, there is immense interest in the use of SIRT1 activating compounds (STACs) to prevent or treat a wide range of aging-related disease. The links between dietary macronutrients, nutrient sensing and healthspan have historically focused upon caloric or protein restriction with limited attention given to dietary lipids. However, a small and growing body of literature has linked monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) to improved healthspan. In addition to positive effects on lifespan and healthy aging in model organisms, dietary MUFAs have been linked to wide-ranging health benefits in epidemiological studies and, since they are a primary constituent of olive oil, thought to contribute to the benefits of the Mediterranean Diet. Despite these studies, little is known about the biological underpinnings through which MUFAs elicit their beneficial health effects. We have previously shown that lipid droplet catabolism (i.e. lipolysis) increases SIRT1 and downstream PGC-1a/PPAR- a signaling as a means to increase mitochondrial biogenesis and function during times of nutrient deprivation. Our preliminary data show for the first time that MUFAs released specifically from lipolysis are trafficked to the nucleus where they allosterically activate SIRT1 towards select acetylated peptide substrates. This discovery makes MUFAs the first-known endogenous allosteric activators of SIRT1. Moreover, we show that MUFAs activate SIRT1 through a similar mechanism to resveratrol suggesting that MUFA signaling may modulate the response to exogenous SIRT1 activators. Based on these preliminary data, the objective of this application is to further characterize the role of MUFAs as endogenous SIRT1 activators. We hypothesize that MUFAs selectively activate SIRT1 to modulate the response to numerous dietary interventions known to impact healthspan. To test our objective, we propose the following aims: Aim 1: To define how MUFAs modulate SIRT1 substrate selectivity. Aim 2: To characterize the SIRT1-dependent effects of MUFAs/olive oil on healthspan. Aim 3: To determine the contribution of MUFAs in mediating the response to STACs or caloric restriction.

"Integrative Biology Approach to Identify and Characterize Roles of lncRNAs Associated with Psoriasis Pathology PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate After the completion of my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics, I joined the Center for Statistical Genetics at the University of Michigan (U-M) as research fellow and acquired extensive training in analysis on high- dimensional biological data. I uncovered a strong interest in studying the genetics and genomics of psoriasis when working with Dr. James Elder at the U-M, and I developed a fascination in understanding the functional roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in cutaneous diseases. I joined the Department of Dermatology at the U-M as a faculty in summer of 2015, with secondary appointments in the Department of Computational Medicine & Bioinformatics and the Department of Biostatistics. In addition, I direct the new Center for Cutaneous Bioinformatics within the Department of Dermatology, and serve to supervise and implement an analysis pipeline for studies investigating the immunological mechanisms for different skin diseases. Career Development Plan I aim to become a future leader in combining in silico discovery and bench experiments to advance biomedical research in autoimmune skin disorders. My objective in seeking a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to acquire the additional knowledge, training, and experience necessary for me to become an independent scholar in developing novel systems biology approaches to decipher the pathology and mechanisms of cutaneous diseases. The five year training proposed will provide knowledge and experience in aspects that are critical to my success, and they are: i) To develop knowledge and experimental skills in cutaneous biology --- achieved by guidance from Dr. Elder (investigative dermatology), intense research meetings/conferences, and practical laboratory experience in cutaneous research; ii) To develop knowledge and skills to study immunological systems of autoimmune skin diseases --- achieved by supervision from Dr. Johann Gudjonsson (skin immunology), attending formal Immunology courses and seminars, and earning laboratory experience from immunology experiments; iii) To advance skills in developing statistical and computational approaches --- accomplished by mentoring from Dr. Goncalo Abecasis (computational biologist), research meetings, and conducting research projects requiring advanced skills and knowledge in quantitative science; iv) To cultivate my professional development through enhancing scientific connections, grantsmanship skills, and educator portfolio --- achieved by establishing connections with colleagues during meetings, visiting King’s College London as scholar, attending a grantsmanship workshop and bootcamp, and learning mentoring skills through teaching formal classes and mentoring research students. Through the intensive and comprehensive training, I will be well grounded in conducting basic science experiments and also be able to capitalize my advanced knowledge in quantitative science to model mechanisms in cutaneous diseases. Research Project The research project will use psoriasis as a disease model to study the roles of lncRNAs in complex cutaneous disorders. I will test the hypotheses that (i): some lncRNAs are key causal elements and potentiate pathogenic inflammatory reactions in psoriasis development and (ii) by combining in silico predictions and in vitro validations we are able to provide comprehensive characterization of skin-expressing lncRNAs in keratinocytes and lymphocytes to infer their pathological implications for psoriasis. This work will demonstrate how we can take advantages of the genomic data to develop an integrative biology framework to provide novel biological insights and understand pathological roles of lncRNAs. Significance Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated skin disease with complex genetic architecture. It is estimated that over 4 million Americans and 100 million people worldwide suffer from this disease. While genetic association studies have revealed the disease loci are highly enriched in non-coding regions, it is very challenging to translate genetic signals to biologic effects. In fact, most of the causal genes have not yet been identified. Our preliminary results showed that lncRNA is a class of gene that has largely been understudied for their roles in psoriasis, and both genetic and transcriptomic data suggested they can play important functions in psoriasis pathogenesis. By combining in silico analysis and in vitro validation we can expand our knowledge of lncRNAs in skin biology, and generate important hypotheses for future experiments. The results of this project can also identify novel biomarkers, and ultimately assist in the therapeutic drug discovery.

"Genotype First: Actionable Genetic Risk through Genotype-to-Phenotype Prediction Project Summary Early disease prevention, detection, and intervention are fundamental goals for advancing human health. Meanwhile, genetic risk is, for all intents and purposes, the earliest significant contributor to common, heritable, disease risk. Thus, in theory, genetic profiling should be the ideal tool for early disease prevention. Yet, genetic factors are rarely used directly to predict future disease risk. Rather, genetic information is typically relegated to phenotype-first scenarios: providing or confirming diagnoses for individuals with overt disease or clarifying the genetic risk for individuals with a strong family history of disease. For modern genomics to make a significant impact on disease prevention the use of genomic information must transition to a genotype-first approach; prediction of genetic disease risk in otherwise healthy individuals. A major barrier to this transition includes our limited ability to predict the precise array of risks and likely phenotypic expression of disease in an individual from genetic and other risk factors. The degree of disease risk and phenotypic expression conveyed to any single individual by genetic factors is a result of a complex interplay between direct and indirect genetic effects, other unmodifiable risk factors (age, gender, ancestry, family history), and intermediate modifiable risk factors (environment, behavior, laboratory values, health status, therapy status, etc.) many of which have their own direct genetic mediators. New approaches are required to dissect this interplay in order to personalize and contextualize preventative actions that most effectively reduce overall disease risk. The overarching goal of this proposal is the development of innovative Deep learning and machine-learning approaches to integrate baseline genetic risk predictions with the measurement of traditional risk factors in order to provide more accurate and actionable predictions of disease risk. By tying genetic risk to traditional risk factors, especially modifiable risk factors, we will enable actionability by allowing both a determination of preventative actions that may be especially effective because they offset genetic risk, as well as the identification of modifiable risk factors that should be monitored and controlled proactively given increased genetic predisposition. To accomplish this goal, we propose to develop methods to: (1) infer the likely phenotypic expressivity of monogenic risk variants via a spatial covariance machine learning approach, (2) predict prevalent disease cases and the expected value of intermediate modifiable risk factors from polygenic and other unmodifiable risk factors, and finally (3) predict prevalent disease cases through interactions between baseline genetic expectations and observed (measured) intermediate modifiable risk factors in a deep learning framework. Adjusting age and modifiable risk factors in these trained models would then allow for the interactive projection of future disease risk and the identification of modifiable risk factors that, when manipulated, lead to the greatest change in future disease risk. We focus on the development of methods for coronary artery disease given its public health importance, the known utility of polygenic risk estimation, and the current evidence for polygene-by-environment interactions. In addition, the approach we propose integrates directly with current clinical decision support tools for coronary artery disease management. However, we will build a general framework that can be extended to any common heritable adult-onset condition, especially those with known heritable, traditional risk factors Project Narrative Significant investment has been placed in the identification of genetic risk factors for common diseases. Yet, outside of family history, genetic risk is almost never included in routine clinical risk assessments. The goal of this proposal is to develop deep learning methods for the integration of genetic and traditional risk factors into comprehensive disease risk prediction.",Genotype First: Actionable Genetic Risk through Genotype-to-Phenotype Prediction,10245285,R01HG010881,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Investments ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary infarction ', ' heart attack ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart infarction ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Family history of ', ' Family Medical History ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Onset of illness ', ' disease onset ', ' disorder onset ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' genetic etiology ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Performance ', ' expectation ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Prevention ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Output ', ' disease phenotype ', ' genetic profiling ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Heritability ', ' modifiable risk ', ' malleable risk ', ' multitask ', ' multi-task ', ' genome-wide analysis ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' clinical practice ', ' clinical risk ', ' risk variant ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk allele ', ' risk gene ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk loci ', ' risk locus ', ' rare variant ', ' rare allele ', ' genetic predictors ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' genetic information ', ' variant of unknown significance ', ' unclassified variant ', ' variant of uncertain clinical significance ', ' variant of uncertain significance ', ' variant of undetermined significance ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' support tools ', ' clinical decision support ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' genetic condition ', ' genetic disorder ', ' feedforward neural network ', ' feed forward neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' feature extraction ', ' data standards ', ' data standardization ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NHGRI,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,761822,CA-49
"Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy Title: Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy ABSTRACT Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex, multifactorial, autoimmune disorder that affects ~1% of the worldwide population (~2 million adults in the US alone). It is characterized by chronic synovitis that, when left untreated, can result in irreversible joint destruction and deformity, leading to increased morbidity and all-cause mortality. The last three decades have witnessed impressive advances in the understanding of disease pathogenesis and therapeutic outcomes. In fact, the use of methotrexate first, and the subsequent incorporation of anti-TNF (TNFi) and other “biologics” have led to substantial improvements in RA clinical outcomes, enhancing the quality of life for millions of patients with inflammatory arthritis. Despite this progress, however, a significant question still remains unanswered: why do over 50% of RA patients with moderate to severe arthritis fail to respond appropriately to these agents? Pharmacomicrobiomics – an emerging field of study that investigates the effect of variations within the human gut microbiome on drugs – promises to overcome these barriers and facilitate precision medicine approaches in autoimmune disease.  Methotrexate (MTX), a dihydrofolate (DHF) reductase inhibitor, remains the anchor drug for the treatment of RA and is used widely throughout the world. While quite effective, oral MTX achieves significant results in less than 50% of patients and remission in only a quarter of them. It is well established that the inter-individual bioavailability of MTX is extremely variable, ranging from 10 to 80%. The reasons for this are presumably multifactorial. However, the intestinal microbiome and its enzymatic machinery are likely to play a significant role, based on our Preliminary Results and given that animals treated with antibiotics or kept under germ-free conditions show significant differences in MTX metabolism relative to control animals.  Our multidisciplinary team composed of rheumatologists, bioinformaticians, pharmacologists and microbiome researchers will address our overarching goal to study: a) if baseline intestinal microbiome, its genes, and associated metabolites can be used to predict the immunomodulatory responses to MTX in treatment-naïve, new-onset RA (NORA) patients; and b) if the gut microbiomes of MTX non-responders can be manipulated to modulate MTX metabolism and bioavailability. We believe that the results of our highly translational, innovative studies will directly influence therapeutic approaches for the treatment of RA and offer a more personalized approach in which the clinical efficacy response would be predicted early (and potentially improved by microbiome-targeted adjuvant therapies) in any given patient about to initiate MTX, limiting or preventing disease progression and ultimately avoiding wasteful health expenditures (estimated as ~$50,000/year/patient in direct costs). Importantly, we anticipate that our studies will establish generalizable approaches in rheumatology and autoimmunity that could be more broadly applied to the study and clinical maximization of other similar small molecules (e.g., JAK inhibitors) or even biologic agents (e.g., anti-TNF mAbs). NARRATIVE Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, autoimmune disease characterized by widespread musculoskeletal inflammation affecting 1% of the world’s population (including ~2 million adults in the US alone). While the use of methotrexate (MTX) has significantly improved the lives of many people with RA, over 50% of patients do not respond adequately to this drug. Successful completion of our proposed studies will provide key insights into the effects of the gut bacteria on MTX and the implications for prediction of clinical response, ultimately identifying patients that are either likely to improve even before this treatment is prescribed, or those that would benefit from microbiome-targeted interventions to improve MTX absorption and

"Using Remote Sensing Technology to Assess Parent-Infant Interactions as a Mechanism Linking COVID-related Stress and Infant Neurobehavioral Functioning The young child’s ability to regulate stress sets the foundation for a host of developmental outcomes, and the parent-infant relationship is the primary context in which stress regulation capacities first develop. Prior research underscores how parents’ own stress may lead to disturbances in parent-infant co-regulation of stress. Given the immense disruptions to family life resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, it is critical to understand the degree to which COVID-related stress may impact the parent-infant relationship and ultimately infants’ neurobehavioral outcomes. We posit here that (a) maternal stress due to the pandemic will be associated with disturbances in the mother-infant relationship, particularly with respect to mother-infant co- regulation of infant distress and (b) mothers’ experiences of COVID-related stress will have an indirect effect on infant neurobehavioral outcomes, in part, due to disturbances to the mother-infant relationship. We also aim to investigate risk factors (e.g., maternal depressive symptoms, substance use; infant negative emotionality) that might exacerbate such linkages, as well as protective factors (e.g., maternal social support, coping) that may attenuate them. We will partner with six sites from the NIH HEALthy Brain and Child Development Study- Phase 1 (New York University, Oregon Health Sciences University, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, Arkansas Children’s Research Institute) that will permit addressing the proposed aims among a geographically diverse sample of 240 families with infants between 6 and 18 months of age. To assess key constructs relevant to mother-infant relationship disturbance, we will use a novel multimodal sensing platform that captures infant vocalizations, stress physiology, and motor behavior, and we will employ machine learn approaches to these multimodal data to yield automated assessments of mother-infant co-regulation of infant distress. By combining assessments of (a) mothers’ COVID-related experiences, as well as maternal, family, and infant functioning, collected by the six HBCD sites via maternal reports and virtual visits and (b) mother-infant co-regulation of stress in home environments using remote multimodal sensing technology, the current study will provide unique opportunities for a nuanced and rich understanding of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on infants born during this unprecedented time. Downstream effects of COVID-19 on infants’ neurobehavioral outcomes are likely to be transmitted, in part, through disruptions in the parent-infant relationship due to parents’ heightened stress and poorer mental health. This project will investigate such downstream effects using novel technology and machine learning methods that permit remote assessment of infants and parents in the home. Results from this project may aid in the development of “just-in-time” interventions for parents and infants at risk for relationships disturbance.",Using Remote Sensing Technology to Assess

"Statistical Models for Dissecting Human Population Admixture and its Role in Evolution and Disease Project Summary Over the past decade, it has become clear that mixture between diverged populations (admixture) has been a recurrent feature in human evolution. It has also become evident that a detailed understanding of admixture is essential for effective disease gene mapping as well as evolutionary inference. Nevertheless, adequate analytical tools to dissect admixture and its impact on phenotype are lacking. As a result, disease gene mapping or evolutionary studies have either excluded admixed populations or relied on simplified models at the risk of inaccurate inferences. This proposal proposes to develop computational methods to infer the genomic structure and history of admixed populations across a range of evolutionary time scales and to leverage this structure to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the genetic architecture and evolution of complex phenotypes. The proposed methods will integrate powerful sources of information from ancient DNA with genomes from present-day human populations. These methods will enable populations with a history of admixture to be studied just as effectively as homogeneous populations. The first step in obtaining a thorough understanding of admixture is a principled and scalable statistical framework to infer fine-scale genomic structure (local ancestry) and evolutionary relationships. This proposal leverages recent advances in statistical machine learning to develop effective tools for the increasingly common and challenging problem of local ancestry inference where reference genomes for ancestral populations are unavailable (de-novo local ancestry). Further, the proposal intends to develop models to infer complex evolutionary histories as well as realistic mating patterns in admixed populations. These inferences will form the starting point to systematically understand how admixture has shaped phenotypes. For example, it is becoming clear that admixture between modern humans and archaic humans (Neanderthals and Denisovans) could have had a major impact on human phenotypes. This question will be explored by applying novel statistical methods to large genetic datasets with phenotypic measurements to assess the adaptive as well as phenotypic impact of Neanderthal alleles. Finally, large collections of genomes from extinct populations that are now becoming available due to advances in ancient DNA technologies can lead to vastly more powerful methods for evolutionary inference that overcome the limitation of methods that rely only on extant genomes. Statistical models that use ancient genome time-series to efficiently infer admixture histories, local ancestry and selection will be developed. Project Narrative Although mixture events between human populations (admixture) are now known to have been common throughout human history and are likely to have had a major impact on human phenotypes, we lack adequate methods to study these processes. Our work will lead to a suite of powerful tools to understand the history of admixture, the impact of admixture on fine-scale genomic structure and function. Our work not only lead to new insights into the genetic basis and evolution of complex phenotypes but will ensure that major population groups, many of whom descend from admixture events or from ancestral groups distinct from those of Europeans, can benefit from the advances in genomics.",Statistical Models for Dissecting Human Population Admixture and its Role in Evolution and Disease,10239056,R35GM125055,"['Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Chromosome Mapping ', ' Gene Localization ', ' Gene Mapping ', ' Gene Mapping Genetics ', ' Linkage Mapping ', ' Total Human and Non-Human Gene Mapping ', ' genetic mapping ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Evolution ', ' Genome ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Modernization ', ' Phenotype ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' European ', ' Measurement ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' mate ', ' Partner in relationship ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' structural genomics ', ' Population Group ', ' genetic evolution ', ' Admixture ', ' Collection ', ' Process ', ' Population ', ' analytical tool ', ' reference genome ', ' reference assembly ', ' genetic architecture ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R35,2021,332952,CA-33
"Multimodality imaging-driven multifidelity modeling of aortic dissection PROJECT SUMMARY. Aortic dissections are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in young and old individuals alike. Whereas type A (ascending aorta) dissections are treated aggressively via surgery, type B (descending thoracic aorta) dissections are often monitored for long periods to determine the best treatment. These lesions can cease to propagate (i.e., stabilize or heal) or they can propagate further and either turn inward and connect again with the true lumen to form a re-entry tear or turn outward and result in rupture in the case of an compromised adventitia. Notwithstanding the importance of these later events, there is a pressing need to understand better the early processes that initiate the dissection and drive its initial propagation as well as to determine whether the presence of intramural thrombus is protective or not against early or continued propagation. Over the past 5 years our collaborative team has developed numerous new multimodality imaging techniques, biomechanical testing methods, and computational modeling approaches across multiple scales that uniquely positions us to understand better the process of early aortic dissection and the possible roles played by early intramural thrombus development. In this project, we propose to use nine complementary mouse models to gain broad understanding of the bio-chemo-mechanical processes that lead to aortic dissection and to introduce a new machine learning based multifidelity modeling approach to develop predictive probabilistic multiscale models of dissection. These models will be informed, trained, and validated via data obtained from a combination of unique in vitro biomechanical phenotyping experiments (wherein we can, for the first time, quantify the initial delamination process under well-controlled conditions and regional material properties thereafter) and novel multimodality imaging of delamination / dissection both in vitro and in vivo. We will consider, for example, the roles of different elastic lamellar geometries; we will assess separate roles of focal proteolytic activation and pooling of highly negatively charged mucoid material, which can degrade or swell the wall respectively; and we will model and assess the effects of early thrombus deposition within a false lumen. We submit that our new probabilistic paradigm, based on statistical autoregressive schemes and enabled by machine learning tools, could be transformative and lead to a paradigm shift in disease prediction where historical data, animal experiments, and limited clinical input (e.g., multiomics) can be used synergistically for robust prognosis and thus interventional planning. Our work is also expected to lead naturally to an eventual better understanding of the chronic processes associated with dissection via predictive models that are aided by the expected “revolution of resolution” in diagnostic imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Mounting evidence reveals that thoracic aortic dissections – which afflict young and old individuals alike – are responsible for even greater disability and death than long thought. We will use a unique combination of multiple mouse models, advanced medical imaging, and novel computational models to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the initiation of a dissection and reasons for the extreme biological variability that characterizes these lethal lesions.",Multimodality imaging-driven multifidelity modeling of aortic dissection,10242915,U01HL142518,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aorta ', ' Aortic Rupture ', ' Arteries ', ' ascending aorta ', ' Attention ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bio-engineered ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bioengineering ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Carotid Arteries ', ' Charge ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnostic Imaging ', ' Dilatation - action ', ' Dilatation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dissection ', ' Foundations ', ' Glycosaminoglycans ', ' Mucopolysaccharides ', ' Goals ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' In Vitro ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Phenotype ', ' Platelet aggregation ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Thrombus ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Cervical ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' mucoid ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Animal Experiments ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Tunica Adventitia ', ' Adventitia ', ' disability ', ' normotensive ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Video Microscopy ', ' Videomicrography ', ' Videomicroscopy ', ' Collaborations ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Event ', ' intracranial artery ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Infusion ', ' Infusion procedures ', ' computer imaging ', ' digital imaging ', ' particle ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Prevention ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' blunt force trauma ', ' Blunt Trauma ', ' Thorace ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorax ', ' Chest ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' Clotting ', ' Coagulation ', ' Coagulation Process ', ' Address ', ' Defect ', ' Data ', ' multi-modal imaging ', ' multi-modality imaging ', ' multimodality imaging ', ' Multimodal Imaging ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Scheme ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Thoracic aorta ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' healing ', ' virtual ', ' multi-scale modeling ', ' multiscale modeling ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Rupture ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupling ', ' Heritability ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' public health relevance ', ' Geometry ', ' microSPECT ', ' micro SPECT ', ' micro single photon emission computed tomography ', ' µSPECT ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' in silico ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,559400,CT-03

"Spatial omics technologies to map the senescent cell microenvironment Project Summary/Abstract Cellular senescence is a biological program whereby cells exit the cell cycle, typically as a consequence of DNA damage accumulation. After exerting their beneficial effects in young individuals by playing a role in tissue homeostasis, wound healing and tumor suppression, senescent cells are recognized and cleared by the immune system in response to their senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). With age, immunosurveillance becomes increasingly dysregulated, senescent cells accumulate in tissues and their SASP leads to chronic inflammation which has been linked to many age-associated diseases including neurodegeneration, diabetes, osteoarthritis, fibrosis, heart disease and cancer. In addition, radiation and chemotherapy cause the accumulation of senescent cells in both normal and cancer tissues and create a microenvironment which can promote tumor relapse. Hence, methods to characterize the diversity of senescent cells in tissues are critical to improve our understanding of their roles in both normal physiology and disease and to develop more precise and effective senolytic and senostatic interventions. We propose to develop new technologies and integrative solutions to map the spatial epigenomic, transcriptome and proteomic states of senescent cells and their microenvironment in complex tissues. In the UG3 phase, we will develop spatial genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics methodologies to delineate senescent cells in a diverse set of murine tissues, including brain, liver and adipose tissue. We will also perform feasibility studies in a limited number of human samples available through tissue banks and collaborators, and in human cell culture. Our goal is to provide a proof of principle and evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of our proposed tools, technologies and methods (TTM) to identify and characterize the heterogeneity of senescent cells in multiple tissues. In the HG3 phase, we will optimize and expand our methodology to a variety of human tissues obtained from normal samples available from tissue banks, and via collaborations with other SenNet Tissue Mapping Centers (TMCs). Project Narrative Identification of senescent cells in tissues is particularly challenging as it requires detection of sets of markers that can be cell type specific. Our goal is to develop single cell multi-omic imaging technology to measure proteins, RNA and the DNA’s 3-dimensional conformation in senescent cells and in their microenvironment, in a diverse set of tissues. This new technology will allow us to better understand the heterogeneity of the senescent phenotype in tissues, and to study how senescent cells affect the status of neighboring cells.",Spatial omics technologies to map the senescent cell microenvironment,10384585,UG3CA268202,"['Adipose tissue ', ' Fatty Tissue ', ' adipose ', ' white adipose tissue ', ' yellow adipose tissue ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Aging ', ' Cell Senescence ', ' Cellular Aging ', ' Cellular Senescence ', ' Replicative Senescence ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' cell culture ', ' Cell Cycle ', ' Cell Division Cycle ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA Damage ', ' DNA Injury ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Immunologic Surveillance ', ' Immune Surveillance ', ' Immunologic Surveillances ', ' Immunological Surveillance ', ' Immunological Surveillances ', ' Immunosurveillance ', ' Inflammation ', ' Intrinsic factor ', ' Laboratories ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Microscopy ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' osteoarthritic ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Play ', ' Production ', ' Proteins ', ' Relapse ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Tissue Banks ', ' Tissue Collection ', ' Tissue repository ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Work ', ' wound healing ', ' Wound Repair ', ' wound resolution ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Dissociation ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' human tissue ', ' cell type ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Nuclear ', ' novel ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Proteomics ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Transcript ', ' Tumor Suppression ', ' Molecular Tumor Suppression ', ' Molecular ', ' epigenomics ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Imaging technology ', ' transcriptomics ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' tumor ', ' senescence ', ' senescent ', ' single cell sequencing ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' high dimensionality ', ' Multiomic Data ', ' multiple omic data ', ' Chemotherapy and/or radiation ', ' Chemotherapy and Radiation ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NCI,BROWN UNIVERSITY,UG3,2021,357900,RI-01
"A next-generation morbid map of the human genome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The impact of next-generation sequencing (NGS) on gene discovery and molecular diagnostics for Mendelian conditions (MCs) is hard to overstate. However, to provide affected individuals with precise natural history, recurrence risk, and prognosis in clinical settings, identification of pathogenic variant(s)/genotypes alone is often insufficient. This is a challenge most notably for genes that cause more than one MC or ~25% of all genes that underlie MCs. In such an instance, even with a known genotype a patient's phenotype has to be compared to that of all MCs caused by variants in a gene to determine which MC, if any, is the likely diagnosis or whether patient instead has a novel condition. This comparison is increasingly difficult because delineation of the ~5,100 MCs currently known has typically been based on subjective grouping of affected individuals by phenotypic similarity. We propose to develop a quantitative framework for assessing overlap among the distributions of phenotypes due to pathogenic genotypes the same gene and apply this framework genome-wide. NGS has enabled identification of causal genotypes in hundreds of thousands of individuals with MCs, providing a sufficiently large dataset that it is now feasible to use machine learning to quantitatively and systematically identify “clusters” of co-occurring genotypes and phenotypic features for each known gene. We will refine and validate our approach by comparing differences between conventionally-delineated and quantitatively-delineated MCs and by assessing the similarity of individuals with well-studied atypical phenotypes/genotypes to quantitatively-delineated MCs. We will then apply the optimal strategy across the genome to generate a “next- generation morbid map” based on quantitatively-delineated MCs. We will also apply machine learning approaches to identify genomic properties associated with the propensity for each gene to underlie multiple MCs (i.e., the numeric contribution of each gene to the morbid map or phenotropy). This will enable a more precise and complete understanding of the genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of each MC, enable more objective diagnosis of individuals with atypical phenotypes, and more robustly identify the existence of multiple MCs among individuals with non-specific “class” phenotypes (e.g., developmental delay, autism, hearing impairment). We will make all newly developed methods publicly available via interactive and programmatic web-based tools to facilitate extension of this work to other human and model organism datasets. PROJECT NARRATIVE The major goals of this project are to develop a quantitative framework that enables objective delineation of Mendelian conditions, apply the framework to systematically delineate conditions across all genes known to underlie a Mendelian condition, and predict the number of conditions due to each gene. This framework will provide a fuller, unbiased characterization of the genotypic/phenotypic spectrum for all Mendelian conditions, enable more precise diagnoses and counseling of individuals with difficult to diagnose phenotypes, and accelerate the detection of new Mendelian conditions.",A next-generation morbid map of the human genome,10251153,R35HG011297,"['Affect ', ' Counseling ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Risk ', ' Work ', ' Developmental Delay Disorders ', ' Developmental Delay ', ' Specific Child Development Disorders ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Natural History ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Individual ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' novel ', ' Property ', ' Genomics ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Hearing Loss ', ' Hypoacuses ', ' Hypoacusis ', ' dysfunctional hearing ', ' hearing defect ', ' hearing deficit ', ' hearing difficulty ', ' hearing disability ', ' hearing dysfunction ', ' hearing impairment ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Detection ', ' Grouping ', ' groupings ', ' next generation ', ' gene discovery ', ' discover genes ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' NGS Method ', ' NGS system ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' molecular diagnostics ', ' web-based tool ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R35,2021,454043,WA-07

"Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings - GetPreCiSe Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings (GetPreCiSe), is an NHGRI Center of Excellence in ELSI Research (CEER) that, in its first four years, established an environment for multi-disciplinary study that produced innovative ways of studying genetic privacy and identity. Specifically, the center 1) parsed the concept of genetic privacy into its often conflated constituent components, including: the “right to be let alone,” control and governance of data, and concerns about downstream uses of data; 2) documented and critically assessed the privacy practices of direct to consumer genetic testing (DTC-GT) companies; 3) examined how and why people trade off personal privacy for other social goods and services; 4) used new techniques to explore how film, television, and social media reflect and affect public perceptions of genetic privacy; and 5) refined understanding of the risk that people will be re-identified from their genomic information. During this time, many developments raised new issues of privacy and identity for genetics. First is the growth of DTC-GT, which generates genetic information used to trace ancestry, acquire health information, find relatives, uncover parentage, and pursue law enforcement investigations, among other activities. Second, laws and regulations governing data privacy and security, particularly with respect to genomics, are changing rapidly in the U.S. and abroad. These often conflict and present new challenges as genomic data move across state and international borders. Third, the creation of ever larger cohorts, such as the NIH’s All of Us Research Program, raises further dilemmas because some or all of the genomic and other data participants provide will be made available to investigators working in a variety of settings and subject to different regulatory regimes. Moreover, participants in these studies may receive research results, which could be deposited in their electronic health records, making this data subject to clinical regulation and compelling action by clinical providers who may not have the knowledge or infrastructure to respond. Thus, as our understanding of genomics increases, so, too, do its multifarious roles and implications for individuals, families, and society evolve. Given the evolving landscape, in its next four years GetPreCiSe will address three complementary specific aims: 1) Apply multimodal methods to characterize how social practices affect, and are affected by, evolving notions of genetic privacy and identity and increased availability of data, 2) Characterize how emerging legal and regulatory frameworks influence genomic privacy and identity in the US and abroad, and 3) Engineer and evaluate new technologies and quantitative frameworks that have potential to intrude on, but also protect, genetic privacy and identity. Recognizing that genetic data processing opportunities and threats are evolving, GetPreCiSe is designed to be a multi-disciplinary center, focused on training the next generation of ELSI researchers, with sufficient agility to respond to emerging issues. We anticipate these aims will need to be refined, and possibly pivoted, over the next four years and so stand ready to seed new investigations into emerging issues and compose new teams for investigation as needed. The incorporation of genetics and genomics into medical care and the public domain raises new challenges for how we understand privacy and identity, concepts that have long been closely linked in American discourse. The Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings (GetPreCiSe), an NHGRI Center of Excellence in Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications Research (CEER) will 1) characterize how social practices and genetic data access affect notions of genetic privacy and identity, 2) assess the impact of emerging laws and regulatory frameworks in the US and abroad, and 3) gauge how new technologies compromise but also uphold protections.",Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings - GetPreCiSe,10256016,RM1HG009034,"['Advertising ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Arts ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' California ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Conceptions ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Data Collection ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' European Union ', ' European Community ', ' Family ', ' Genetic Identity ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Imagination ', ' Laws ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Genetic Models ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Newspapers ', ' Perception ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Seeds ', ' Plant Embryos ', ' Plant Zygotes ', ' seed ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Societies ', ' Technology ', ' Television ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Privacy ', ' Data Protection ', ' Data Security ', ' Data awareness ', ' information security ', ' Film ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' Law Enforcement ', ' Public Domains ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' news ', ' Genetic ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' social ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' Genomics ', ' Genetic Privacy ', ' Provider ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Legal ', ' Radio ', ' ACT2 ', ' AT744.1 ', ' Act-2 ', ' CCL4 ', ' Chemokine (C-C Motif) Ligand 4 ', ' Chemokine, CC Motif, Ligand 4 ', ' Immune Activation 2 ', ' MIP1B ', ' MIP1B1 ', ' Macrophage Inflammatory Protein 1-Beta ', ' SCYA4 ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine A4 ', ' CCL4 gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Use of New Techniques ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' National Human Genome Research Institute ', ' NHGRI ', ' National Center for Human Genome Research ', ' ethical legal social implication ', ' ELSI ', ' ethical, legal, and social ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' community setting ', ' minimal risk ', ' legal implication ', ' data sharing ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' genetic information ', ' behavioral economics ', ' Genetic study ', ' social media ', ' data access ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' All of Us Research Program ', ' All of Us Program ', ' All of Us Research Project ', ' AoURP ', ' Infrastructure ', ' blockchain ', ' block chain ', ' data privacy ', ' genetic testing ', ' gene testing ', ' gene-based testing ', ' ']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,RM1,2021,1051733,TN-05
"High performance PET Detector Module for Human Brain Imaging Project Summary / Abstract This proposal is in response to PA 18-484. In the BRAIN 2025 Report, PET (positron emission tomography) is identified as “the best means to translate studies of neurotransmitters, receptors, and neuromodulators to humans.” However dynamic assessment of receptor occupancy and metabolism is hindered by the spatial resolution and sensitivity of even the most modern of clinically available PET scanners. To address this challenge, we propose a next generation PET detector with a highly innovative design: a detector module with a layered scintillator structure and a side readout configuration. The crystal slabs in the module are stacked along the depth direction and are optically separated by reflective films. The scintillation light created in each layer is measured by photodetectors located on the four sides of the crystal. Compared with traditional PET detectors, which contain pixelated crystal arrays, the new design has the following advantages: (1) The layered structure provides depth of interaction (DOI) information such that a smaller diameter detector ring can be used without increasing parallax error, increasing sensitivity while lowering costs. (2) The four-sided readout method improves the energy resolution of the system with increased scintillation light collection efficiency by reducing light loss due to total internal reflection. (3) Sub millimeter spatial resolution is achievable without using very small pitch crystal arrays, since the interaction location in each crystal layer is determined via machine learning- based decoding of the light distribution collected on the four crystal sides. Therefore the production cost of the crystals is reduced. (4) Since the interaction location and energy resolution for each layer are determined independently, the system sensitivity can be increased by stacking more layers in the module without affecting the spatial and energy resolution of the system. (5) For side readout setup, a larger ratio of cross-sectional area to length requires fewer photodetectors to cover all four sides of the module; this reduces photodetector cost. The first four points above have been demonstrated in preliminary studies using a small, prototype module. We propose to build a large scale detector module with this new design to verify the fifth advantage, and to study the effect of detector size on the first four. The outcome of this proposal will be two DOI enabled detector modules with excellent spatial resolution (~1 mm) and energy resolution (~10%), as well as good timing resolution (~400 ps), and DOI resolution (~ 3 mm) and high system sensitivity. A full characterization study for the two modules and imaging studies for both the Derenzo and Hoffman brain phantoms will address the current limitations of human brain PET scanners, and will serve as the foundation for a new dynamic PET scanner for neuroimaging. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop a novel design for detector modules used in brain-dedicated PET system with good spatial resolution, energy resolution, timing resolution, and DOI resolution, as well as high sensitivity. If successful, the study will pave the way for building a novel PET system for greatly improved dynamic PET imaging of the human brain.",High performance PET Detector Module for Human Brain Imaging,10254284,R01EB028337,"['Affect ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Neoplasms ', ' Brain Neoplasia ', ' Brain Tumors ', ' tumors in the brain ', ' Calibration ', ' Crystallization ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Foundations ', ' Gamma Rays ', ' Gamma Radiation ', ' γ-Radiation ', ' γ-Ray ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Portugal ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' PET ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET imaging ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PETT ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' Production ', ' Neurotransmitter Receptor ', ' Neurohumor Receptors ', ' Neuromediator Receptors ', ' Neuroregulator Receptors ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Silicon ', ' Si element ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Translating ', ' Measures ', ' Film ', ' base ', ' detector ', ' improved ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Imaging Phantoms ', ' Staging ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' millimeter ', ' Event ', ' Side ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' meetings ', ' Performance ', ' photomultiplier ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' brain size ', ' response ', ' Neuromodulator ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Resolution ', ' Collection ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' prototype ', ' Geometry ', ' human imaging ', ' imaging study ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' Rod ', ' ']",NIBIB,"CANON MEDICAL RESEARCH USA, INC.",R01,2021,237471,IL-10
"San Diego Nathan Shock Center PROJECT SUMMARY – Overall Since aging is the biggest risk factor of most human diseases and the overall functional decline in individuals, there is great interest in understanding its biological underpinnings, with the ultimate goal of increasing the number of healthy and productive years of human life (i.e., healthspan). Conserved mechanisms of aging and longevity have been identified via investigations into the basic biology of aging. These include studies in model organisms that have also shown that aging is pliable, opening the door for healthspan-promoting interventions. However, a major complicating factor that impedes our understanding of aging and our ability to intervene is the intrinsic and induced heterogeneity of the process. Distinct cell types have intrinsically different aging modalities, and even identical cell types age at different rates depending on physiological context or environmental exposures. These and other cellular heterogeneities (e.g., altered epigenetic states and gene expression) can drive tissue dysfunction and age-related pathology that ultimately impact healthspan and lifespan. Unravelling this complexity experimentally requires application of robust single-cell and imaging approaches to address the heterogeneity of cellular aging head-on, as well as computational and mathematical modelling approaches to illuminate aging networks and pathway interactions that involve known hallmarks of aging. Another major gap in aging research is the need for new and better human cell and tissue models to allow basic research directly relevant to human aging. Thus, the overarching premise of the proposed San Diego Nathan Shock Center (SD-NSC) is to create the requisite infrastructure to facilitate and promote the systematic study of cellular heterogeneity in aging and to provide novel cell and tissue models for basic human aging studies. The SD-NSC will establish cutting-edge Research Resource Cores focused on: 1) novel human cell and organoid models of aging, including from a unique human aging cohort that is annotated for physical and functional measures of biological age, 2) single-cell and high resolution -omics and imaging techniques, and 3) computational modelling of aging networks. The SD-NSC Research Resource Cores will provide scientific services to the NSC Network and the aging research community, and disseminate samples, datasets protocols, and computational tools. These resources will be complemented by a Research Development Core and Center outreach activities that will provide: 1) pilot grants and customized mentoring programs to encourage and support early-stage and established investigators new to aging research, 2) innovative in- person and virtual training in advanced methods and technologies to address cellular heterogeneity, and 3) intellectual leadership through novel programming to encourage collaboration and the dissemination of knowledge related to the basic biology of aging. The SD-NSC will bring together complementary expertise and resources from three renowned San Diego research Institutions with the common goal of understanding the role of cellular heterogeneity in aging to ultimately enable interventions to extend human healthspan. PROJECT NARRATIVE The cells and tissues of the human body age at different rates depending on their precise anatomical location and environment. We currently do not have a full understanding of this “heterogeneity” and how it contributes to overall human aging or the enhanced risk of diseases with age.

"Psoriasis Center of Research Translation The Psoriasis Center of Research Translation at Case Western Reserve University (CORT) will advance translational discovery and application in psoriasis using a cutting-edge systems biology approach that integrates patient-centered data within a rich and synergistic /collaborative institutional environment. We will leverage extensive preclinical, clinical and translational resources with the expertise and experience of our CWRU interdisciplinary research team, which encompasses bioinformatics, micro/myocobiome, psoriasis patient care, cutaneous immunology and transgenic models.  The overall goal of the CORT is to combine new bioinformatic methodologies with advanced murine and human experimental approaches to translate scientific findings into clinical applications that more nimbly advance therapy for psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. Our highly innovative, synergistic and cross-disciplinary CORT model will use a collaborative research project (CRP) as a central hub with bi- directional input from 2 highly interactive research cores, to refine and test hypotheses, identify and test drug leads and advance understanding of psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. To do so, the CRP will integrate input from the: 1) Preclinical Modeling Core (PMC), that will provide and customize our many validated, unique transgenic psoriasiform animal models and translatable human xenograft approaches, essential to translating new mediator/pathway roles and drug leads; 2) Applied Meta-`Omics Core (AMC), that will apply multi-platform (transcriptome, metabolome, micro/mycobiome) bioinformatics to individual patient and murine samples to identify novel pathway-specific targets. Iterative experimental testing of these targets and feedback from the PMC and CRP will identify key novel pathways critical for psoriasis pathogenesis likely to benefit from intervention by new drugs or repurposed existing drugs for psoriasis therapy.  Our patient-centered translational approach will exploit and enhance a novel, comprehensive and highly annotated database of ~850 psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis single-patient case records that combines clinical information derived from CLEARPATH (an Ohio medical provider consortium-based unified EMR repository for research access), with inflammation markers that stratify subsets. Into each patient's EMR, we will directly integrate his/her meta'Omics data created by the AMC working with the CRP, to create an 'Omics-integrated EMR (EMRi) data set. These cohesive multi-platform personal data records will identify psoriasis patient endotypes based upon unique perturbations identified from their “meta'Omics” analyses. Our overarching hypothesis is that by powerfully combining existing and developing psoriasis basic science datasets, patient records, bioinformatics and computational systems biology with bi-directional mouse and human studies, we will identify new therapeutic targets and repurposed drugs that can be expeditiously moved to clinical trials, improving psoriasis treatment and patient care. The Psoriasis CORT at Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center uses emerging capabilities of data analyses that can assemble many aspects of a single psoriasis patient in great detail, including their gene expression in skin and blood cells, the skin microbes (both bacterial and fungal) and the clinical features that are recorded in their electronic medical record (EMR). Using advanced computer algorithms to compare in-house patient data against externally available large databases, we can identify drugs already approved by the FDA that may be repurposed to treat psoriasis, and validate/invalidate them in animal models and patient cells.",Psoriasis Center of Research Translation,10259872,P50AR070590,"['Psoriatic Arthritis ', ' Arthritic Psoriasis ', '

"Collaborative multi-site project to speed the identification and management of rare genetic immune diseases Summary  The subject of this proposal is a new, collaborative approach to improve the diagnosis of primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs). These patients have individually rare, monogenic disorders leading to severe infections, autoimmunity, and inflammation. The prevalence of PIDs is ~1:10,000 and approximately half have antibody deficiencies as their main immunological phenotype. Most doctors are unaware of these diseases and many patients go years without a diagnosis, costing the system tens of thousands of dollars per patient yearly and unnecessarily increasing morbidity and mortality. There is a tremendous, untapped opportunity to advance the diagnosis of patients with PIDs.  We propose to utilize new machine-learning approaches to algorithmically identify patients with PIDs from their electronic health records (EHR). To accomplish our goals, we have built a coalition of computational genomics groups at UCLA, UCSF, and Vanderbilt (Computational team), and clinical immunology groups at the five University of California medical centers (Los Angeles, San Francisco, Irvine, San Diego, and Davis) (Immunology team). We propose to: Identify patients with rare immune diseases by phenotype risk scoring (Aim 1). We will speed the identification of patients with rare immune diseases by surveilling the EHR using a phenotype risk scoring approach, building upon recently published work in Science. We will apply this approach to the UCLA, UCSF, and Vanderbilt clinical data repositories to identify potential cases. We will improve risk scoring by considering gender, age, and race/ethnicity. We will classify patients by whether they have an infection phenotype or immune dysregulation phenotype. Subsequently, we will expand to the larger, UC Health-wide Data Warehouse (UCHWDW), entailing 15+ million patients across all UC medical centers. We will then Identify the genetic immune diseases for these newly found subjects (Aim 2). We will follow the state-of-the-art approach employed by the UCLA and Vanderbilt Undiagnosed Disease Network (UDN) sites. We will start by sequencing all the known antibody deficiency patients across the Immunology team sites while collaboratively pre-reviewing identified cases from Aim 1 on monthly video-calls. For selected subjects, we will perform whole genome and RNA sequencing. Clinical and research laboratory testing will bring closure to the diagnostic odyssey for these subjects.  The overall impact of this work accelerates the diagnosis and cure of PIDs. This project will also serve as a demonstration of how immunology sites can work together sharing electronic medical records and genomic data to advance care. Narrative A major challenge for patients with immune diseases is the delay in diagnosis that leads to morbidity and mortality. This proposal combines teams from the five medical centers of the University of California and Vanderbilt to apply advanced computational, machine-learning approaches to identify patients with genetic immunodeficiency diseases.

"Receptors, microcircuits and hierarchical connectivity in predictive coding and sensory awareness SUMMARY The standard view of how we make sense of the world around us focuses on reconstructing our environment from the information received by our sensory organs. In this view, low-level brain areas (e.g., primary sensory cortex) represent basic features of objects, which are elaborated on in successive processing stages, until representations become increasingly complex in high-level areas (e.g., frontal cortex). An alternative view is predictive coding (PC), in which we model our environment to generate sensory predictions. In PC, high-level brain areas generate predictions of sensory activity and transmit them to low-level areas. A prediction that does not match the sensory information gives rise to a prediction error. This error signal is sent from low- to high-level brain areas to update the model of our environment, thereby improving future predictions to minimize errors. Modeling studies show PC is a fast and efficient way to process sensory information, and PC provides innovative hypotheses for understanding sleep and anesthesia, particularly when disconnected consciousness occurs (consciousness without awareness of the environment), like dreaming. PC also holds great promise for conceptualizing and treating brain disorders, including schizophrenia and depression. But key central features of PC have not been empirically tested and little is known about the underlying neural mechanisms. The goal of the proposed project is to characterize the neural dynamics, circuits and receptors enabling PC. There are two principle hypotheses. First, predictions depend on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) because NMDAR influence the activity of high-level brain areas where predictions are generated, and NMDAR are enriched on neurons in lower-level areas receiving predictions. Second, in disconnected consciousness, a breakdown of information transmission from low-level to high-level brain areas, as well as a breakdown of computations within each area, explains why models of our environment are not updated by external sensory information. These breakdowns prevent the comparison of predictions and sensory information, as well as the transmission of prediction errors to high-level brain areas. To test these hypotheses, we use a cross-species experimental design connecting cellular, circuit and systems levels to behavior. We will perform electroencephalography, machine learning and computational modeling to define the neural basis of PC in humans performing prediction tasks. Then we will manipulate PC using different anesthetic agents with diverse mechanisms, establishing causal relationships between receptors, large-scale brain networks and PC. In parallel, we will simultaneously record activity from sensory and high-level brain areas of non-human primates (NHPs) using the same PC tasks and pharmacological interventions to measure cellular and circuit level contributions to PC. Investigating PC will illuminate the fundamental mechanisms of perception, providing critical insights to guide therapeutic development for multiple health conditions. NARRATIVE This research advances our understanding of how the brain generates predictions which shape how we perceive the world, otherwise known as predictive coding. Predictive coding is relevant to public health because it holds great promise in conceptualizing and treating brain disorders, including depression, schizophrenia, delirium and dementia, as well as understanding sleep and anesthesia. Progress in understanding the basic mechanisms of predictive coding, as well as predictive coding deficits, is a necessary step in developing more effective treatment strategies for multiple health conditions.","Receptors, microcircuits and hierarchical connectivity in predictive coding and sensory awareness",10216373,R01NS117901,"['Anesthesia procedures ', ' Anesthesia ', ' Anesthetics ', ' Anesthestic Drugs ', ' Anesthetic Agents ', ' Anesthetic Drugs ', ' Auditory area ', ' Auditory Cortex ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Cues ', ' Delirium ', ' delirious ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Dreams ', ' dreaming ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Environment ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Feedback ', ' frontal lobe ', ' frontal cortex ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Ketamine ', ' Macaca ', ' Macaque ', ' Study models ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Perception ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Propofol ', ' Diprivan ', ' Disoprofol ', ' Public Health ', ' Reaction Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Response Time ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Adrenergic Receptor ', ' Adrenoceptors ', ' Epinephrine Receptors ', ' adenoreceptor ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' sedative ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Sleep ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic Nuclei ', ' Unconscious State ', ' Unconscious ', ' Unconsciousness ', ' consciousness loss ', ' Measures ', ' N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors ', ' N-Methylaspartate Receptors ', ' NMDA Receptor-Ionophore Complex ', ' NMDA Receptors ', ' Mediating ', ' Dexmedetomidine ', ' Pulvinar structure ', ' Pulvinar ', ' pulvinar thalami ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Conscious ', ' Consciousness ', ' Individual ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' Agonist ', ' Shapes ', ' sedation ', ' Sedation procedure ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Auditory ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' innovative technologies ', ' experience ', ' human data ', ' paired stimuli ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' sensory cortex ', ' visual stimulus ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' perceptual stimulus ', ' physicochemical phenomena related to the senses ', ' sensory stimulus ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Sensory Process ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Process ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Disinhibition ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' postsynaptic ', ' therapeutic development ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' treatment strategy ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' neural correlate ', ' multi-electrode arrays ', ' multielectrode arrays ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2021,458246,WI-02
"Reclassifying Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Into Immune Phenotypes Using Machine Learning This is a K23 award application for Dr. Andrew Sweatt, a pulmonary/critical care physician and young investigator at Stanford University who is establishing a niche in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) precision phenotyping. His work centers on using machine learning to reclassify PAH, where hidden patterns are detected in high-throughput molecular data to uncover new phenotypes. The existing PAH clinical classification does not inform therapy decisions, and outcomes are overall poor with a ‘one-size-fits-all’ treatment approach. There is a critical need for molecular phenotyping efforts, to develop classification schemes that sit closer to pathobiology and identify therapeutically-targetable patient subsets. Dr. Sweatt’s K23 builds on an innovative foundational study where he used machine learning to cluster PAH patients based on blood immune profiling, without guidance from clinical features. This agnostic approach uncovered 4 immune phenotypes with distinct cytokine profiles that are independent of clinical subtypes and stratify disease risk. These findings indicate that inflammation is a viable platform for PAH reclassification. Extensive research has implicated inflammation in PAH and multiple immune-targeting therapies are under active investigation, but these studies rest on the assumption that a common pathophenotype exists. The objective of Dr. Sweatt’s K23 is to better understand PAH immune phenotypes in terms of their longitudinal evolution, mechanistic underpinnings, and therapeutic implications. First, he will perform serial cytokine profiling in two observational cohorts (Stanford, USA; Sheffield, UK) to reassess immune phenotypes during the disease course (Aim 1). Based on preliminary data, dynamic phenotype switches may occur in some patients and reflect changes in clinical disease severity. Next, he will integrate blood transcriptomic profiling and apply sophisticated computational tools to provide phenotype-specific mechanistic insights (Aim 2). He postulates that distinct transcriptomic profiles will link phenotypes to specific signaling pathways and immune cell subsets. Findings will be validated using multi-cohort data from public repositories. Finally, he will perform post-hoc cytokine profiling in two recent PAH trial cohorts where immune modulators were tested, to assess if therapy responses differ across phenotypes (Aim 3). His research could help identify patients who will respond to specific therapies, inform clinical trial designs, lead to biomarker discovery, and define novel biology in PAH. The K23 will provide Dr. Sweatt with the critical support needed to transition to an independent research career and be a leader in PAH precision phenotyping. His K23 objectives are to gain experience in PAH clinical phenotyping/cohort building, expand expertise in bioinformatics, cultivate collaboration, and translate findings to new hypotheses for R01 development. He will be guided by a committed team of multidisciplinary mentors (Roham Zamanian [expert in PAH clinical trial design/biomarkers], Marlene Rabinovitch [leader in translational PAH research], and Purvesh Khatri [pioneer in bioinformatics]) and scientific advisors (Mark Nicolls [translational PAH immunology], PJ Utz [immunology], and Manisha Desai [biostatistics]). NARRATIVE This proposed research is aimed at classifying novel subtypes of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), by studying inflammation in the blood of patients (complex protein and genetic profiles) and using sophisticated computational methods (machine learning and systems-based network analysis) to find data patterns that would otherwise remain hidden. This research is relevant to public health as the burden of morbidity and mortality is high in PAH, and the current system used to classify patients does not inform treatment decisions. Our project has significant potential to improve public health, as it may yield a PAH classification scheme that sits closer to underlying pathobiology, provide a critical step toward identifying patients who will respond to specific therapies, help improve the design of forthcoming clinical trials, and create a framework for precision medicine.",Reclassifying Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Into Immune Phenotypes Using Machine Learning,10192823,K23HL151892,"['Biology ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Critical Care ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Evolution ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' Immunity ', ' Inflammation ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Mentors ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rest ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Toxin ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' cytokine ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' therapy selection ', ' Immunology ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Collaborations ', ' chemokine ', ' Chemotactic Cytokines ', ' Homologous Chemotactic Cytokines ', ' Intercrines ', ' SIS cytokines ', ' chemoattractant cytokine ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Inflammatory ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Systemic disease ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Orphan Disease ', ' Rare Disorder ', ' orphan disorder ', ' Rare Diseases ', ' novel ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' protein complex ', ' Address ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' DNA mutation ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' genomic alteration ', ' DNA Sequence Alteration ', ' Data ', ' Immune Targeting ', ' K23 Award ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Program ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Mononuclear ', ' Classification Scheme ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Transcript ', ' trend ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Immunomodulators ', ' IMiD ', ' Immune modulatory therapeutic ', ' immune modulating agents ', ' immune modulating drug ', ' immune modulating therapeutics ', ' immune modulators ', ' immune modulatory agents ', ' immune modulatory drugs ', ' immunomodulating agents ', ' immunomodulatory agents ', ' immunomodulatory drugs ', ' immunomodulatory therapeutics ', ' pulmonary arterial hypertension ', ' pulmonary artery hypertension ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' transcriptomics ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Network-based ', ' therapeutic target ', ' overexpression ', ' overexpress ', ' molecular phenotype ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' differential expression ', ' differentially expressed ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' biomarker discovery ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' Growth Factor ', ' Growth Agents ', ' Growth Substances ', ' Proteins Growth Factors ', ' clinical subtypes ', ' public repository ', ' publicly accessible repository ', ' publicly available repository ', ' data repository ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' ']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,193536,CA-18
"Identifying existing, FDA-approved drugs with clinically protective effects against coronavirus disease 2019 using a big data approach Project Summary/Abstract Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a national and global public health emergency. Because the causative virus is novel, the present options for treatment are extremely limited, and an effective vaccine could be 1-2 years away. Thus, there is an urgent need for efficacious therapeutics against the disease. While development of new drugs is under way, that process is slow and resource-intensive. In the short- to-medium term, a superior strategy is to repurpose already existing drugs to treat the disease. Over 100 drugs already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have shown in vitro, in silico, or theoretical effect against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, or the hyperinflammatory immune response it provokes. What is unclear is how many of these have a significant, protective effect on actual patients, as only a tiny fraction of these drugs is in clinical trials. Most of these agents are chronic medications, and thus there are millions of Americans who are already using them. The first aim of this study is to assess the degree of protection any of these drugs confers against the serious complications of COVID-19 while adjusting for known risk factors and confounders. The second aim is to search for additional interactions between drugs or combinations of drugs and specific demographic and/or clinical subgroups that could be protective or harmful. The Change Healthcare Database, a part of the COVID-19 Research Database, contains up-to-date health insurance claims data for about one- third of all Americans. Using this database, this study will evaluate the impact of these drugs on the risk of four important outcomes in patients who are COVID-19-positive: need for hospitalization, use of mechanical ventilation, shock, and death. Results will be risk-adjusted for the risk factors already well established to predict poor outcomes in COVID-19. This study will further mine the data for second- and third-order interactions between drugs or combinations of drugs and different subpopulations of patients using a novel machine learning method called the Feasible Solution Algorithm (FSA). The FSA enables the researcher to uncover higher-order statistical interactions in regression models, which leads to the identification of subgroups and complexities that are not always apparent with traditional regression models. If the results show candidate drugs with highly protective effects, these can be prioritized for prospective clinical studies. Drugs that show harmful effects can be considered for discontinuation in infected or high-risk patients. Project Narrative Repurposing existing drugs to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) is a much faster and more resource-effective approach than developing new drugs de novo. This holds promise because over 100 drugs already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have shown in vitro, in silico, or theoretical activity against SARS- CoV-2 or the immune response it provokes. Using a large health insurance claims database, we will assess the potentially protective effects of each of these drugs on patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and search for interactions between multiple drugs and specific demographic and clinical subpopulations via a novel statistical algorithm.","Identifying existing, FDA-approved drugs with clinically protective effects against coronavirus
