"Using Re-inforcement Learning to Automatically Adapt a Remote Therapy Intervention (RTI) for Reducing Adolescent Violence Involvement Youth violence is a key public health problem. Homicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents (age:14- 20) and disproportionately impacts African-American populations. Urban EDs are a critical opportunity for violence prevention, especially with >600,000 adolescents/year seeking treatment for violence-related injuries. In our longitudinal study of violently-injured adolescents in urban EDs, we found that within 2-years, 37% returned for a repeat violent injury, 59% experienced firearm violence, 38% were arrested, and 1% died. Despite the importance of the problem, strategies to decrease repeat violence after an ED visit have not been well studied. Given our prior work demonstrating that theoretically-based single session ED interventions are efficacious reducing violence among lower risk adolescents, the application of this therapy, expanded to address greater problem severity over multiple sessions and enhanced by including care management, represents a potentially efficacious approach for altering risk trajectories of higher-risk violently-injured adolescents. Our recent pilot of this approach (S-RTI) was well received and addressed problems identified in prior multisession interventions (e.g., transportation) with the addition of remote therapy delivery (e.g., phone). While innovative and promising, this S-RTI approach is resource intensive and does not address heterogeneity in treatment responses. By contrast, adaptive treatment strategies allow for “just-in-time” tailoring that provides a balance between too much and not enough intervention and enhances outcomes while reducing the use of costly resources. Reinforcement learning is an artificial intelligence domain that allows computer systems to “learn” from the success of prior treatments and is a promising approach to constructing adaptive “just-in-time” interventions. For this study, we propose to test two versions of our RTI, a standard RTI condition (S-RTI) comprised of a single ED session followed by 8 remote therapy sessions, and an adaptive RTI version (AI-RTI) optimized by reinforcement learning to step up or down the intensity of treatment between three levels (i.e., remote therapy sessions, automated two- way text messaging, assessment only) based on patient response to daily text message assessments. The specific aims are: 1) To refine and adapt our RTI for delivery using two packages (S-RTI; AI-RTI); 2) To conduct a 3-arm RCT enrolling 900 violently-injured adolescents seeking ED care (age:14-20) to compare the efficacy of S-RTI (n=300), AI-RTI (n=400), and a control condition (n=200); and, 3) To evaluate adaptability of the AI-RTI RL algorithm by comparing the first 50% of enrollees to the second 50% on process variables (e.g., engagement, helpfulness/likability). Primary outcomes (assessed at 4-, 8-, and 12-months) include aggression, victimization, and ED recidivism for violent injury. Secondary outcomes include substance use, mental health symptoms, and criminal justice involvement. As a secondary aim, we will compare resource utilization (i.e., costs/event averted) for the active intervention conditions. Given elevated rates of violence among socio-disadvantaged youth with disparities in access to services, the proposed study has the potential for significant public health impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE Homicide is a leading cause of death among adolescent youth, and disproportionately affects African-American populations. This study, conducted among a sample of adolescents (14-20 years old) seeking treatment in an urban emergency department (ED) for violent injuries, aims to refine, adapt, and test two versions of our previously piloted violence intervention, a standard remote therapy condition (S-RTI) comprised of a single ED therapy session followed by 8 remote therapy sessions and an adaptive RTI version (AI-RTI) optimized by an artificial intelligence algorithm (i.e., reinforcement learning) to step up or down the intensity of treatment between three treatment levels (i.e., remote therapy sessions, automated two-way text messaging, assessment only) based on patient response to daily text message assessments. Given elevated rates of violence among socio- disadvantaged adolescents with disparities in access to services, the proposed intervention, if efficacious, has the potential for significant public

"Neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in adolescent PTSD Project Summary The goal of this proposal is to elucidate neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in early adolescent PTSD. Notably, deficits in directly learned fear extinction are implicated in adult PTSD. However, youth with PTSD live within the family system, which could impact their ability to extinguish trauma memories. Indeed, abnormal parent-child transmission of fear following trauma is a potent risk factor for youth PTSD. Furthermore, trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT), the gold-standard treatment for pediatric PTSD, uses exposure therapy of the child's trauma narrative for both youth and their caregiver. Here, TF-CBT aims to promote extinction of trauma-related fear both directly in the child and vicariously through parent modeling. However, no reported studies have examined the cumulative impact of direct and vicarious fear extinction in pediatric PTSD. Finally, the diagnosis of PTSD in youth continues to rely on DSM syndromal criteria, creating a great need to establish objective, biologically based diagnoses. This innovative research program will (1) identify physiological impairments in direct/vicarious fear extinction and their unique contributions to adolescent PTSD, (2) identify the neural substrates of fear acquisition and direct/vicarious extinction learning in adolescent PTSD, and (3) use machine learning on biomarkers of fear acquisition and direct/vicarious extinction to classify trauma exposure and PTSD diagnosis in adolescents. This interdisciplinary research team will recruit 40 non-traumatized typically developing (TD) youth, 40 trauma- exposed comparison (TEC) youth without mental illness, and 80 medication-free youth with PTSD, ages 10-14, along with their primary caregiving parent. Youth and parents will undergo fear acquisition followed by a novel fear extinction paradigm. Here, youth will undergo two extinction training conditions: 1) direct extinction and 2) vicarious extinction by observing their parent complete extinction training. Parent/child skin conductance and corrugator EMG will be measured during all fear protocol phases. Additionally, youth will complete all fear phases during fMRI to probe neural substrates of fear acquisition, and direct and vicarious extinction. Following physiological and fMRI analyses, a deep evolutionary machine learning approach will be applied to youth neurophysiological fear indices to classify trauma and PTSD status. Primary analyses will 1) examine physiological markers of direct and vicarious extinction in youth and their relative contribution to PTSD, 2) examine neural abnormalities during direct and vicarious extinction in adolescent PTSD, and 3) determine whether adding vicarious extinction markers enhances machine learning classification of youth trauma and PTSD status. This ambitious program of parent-child extinction learning promises to yield the first comprehensive set of neurophysiological markers of pediatric PTSD that will allow for objective, rational targeting of treatment in the parent-child dyad to improve outcomes for afflicted youth. Project Narrative This project seeks to conduct the first comprehensive, biological study of how parent-child fear and safety learning contribute to adolescent PTSD. This project will establish biomarkers of parent-child safety learning in adolescent PTSD, and test whether machine learning can use these markers to diagnose PTSD in youth. This research would represent a significant advance beyond subjective assessments currently used in clinical settings, paving the way towards biologically-based diagnosis and treatment of youth PTSD within the family context.",Neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in adolescent PTSD,10067383,R01MH117141,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Emotions ', ' Exhibits ', ' Extinction (Psychology) ', ' Extinction ', ' behavioral extinction ', ' Family ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Galvanic Skin Response ', ' Electrodermal Response ', ' Psychogalvanic Reflex ', ' Skin Electric Conductance ', ' skin conductance ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Learning ', ' male ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Parents ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Safety ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' post-trauma stress disorder ', ' posttrauma stress disorder ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Training ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Stimulus ', ' learning extinction ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' girls ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' Biological Testing ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Scheme ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' caregiving ', ' care giving ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' Face Processing ', ' facial processing ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Trauma ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' early adolescence ', ' Structural defect ', ' Structural malformation ', ' structural abnormalities ', ' structural anomalies ', ' imaging platform ', ' predicting response ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' improved outcome ', ' recruit ', ' trauma exposure ', ' exposure to trauma ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Differences between sexes ', ' Differs between sexes ', ' Sexual differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2021,765655,WI-02
"MoodRing: A multi-stakeholder platform to monitor and manage adolescents' depression in primary care with passive mobile sensing. ABSTRACT As rates of adolescent depression and suicidality continue to trend upwards, the healthcare system struggles to address the need for and lack of mental health service use. The pediatric patient-centered medical home model may improve adolescent depression outcomes by enhancing access to and coordinating care, as well as providing ongoing monitoring. Unfortunately, despite guideline recommendations, over 2/3 of adolescents identified with depression symptoms in primary care do not receive symptom monitoring and 19% do not re- ceive symptom reassessment. This lack of symptom monitoring and reassessment can result in untoward health outcomes including a decrease in functioning, increased use of acute and crisis services, and hospitali- zations due to suicidality. Current technologies which incorporate data passively collected from smartphones offer an opportunity for intercurrent monitoring between patient visits which limits burden on the patient to self- report and limits burden on the healthcare system, allowing primary care teams to triage contacting and as- sessing patients a system identifies with an increase in disease severity. This formative study will demonstrate the usability and potential clinical utility of MoodRing, a technology intervention which will collect passive mo- bile phone sensor data on aspects of adolescent phone use related to depressive symptom severity (e.g. com- munication patterns, social media use, travel) and integrate this data into a multi-user (adolescent, parent, pri- mary care provider/care manager) platform from which symptoms can be viewed and secure communication can occur. MoodRing, as supported by Health Belief Model, may lead to improved quality of depression man- agement (increased symptom reassessment, therapy/medication adherence) through increasing self-efficacy, social support from parent and care team, as well as encouraging application of self-management skills through increased self-management knowledge, skills, and symptom feedback. MoodRing builds on a solid foundation of investigators experienced in design of technology interventions to increase adolescent initiation of depression treatment, who have already developed machine algorithms for passive sensing and a small business partner with vast experience in working with health researchers to develop multi-user web/mobile platforms. This STTR Phase I study seeks to accomplish two aims. The first is to apply a machine learning pipeline developed for college-aged youth to adolescents with depression and determine whether self-reported depressive symptoms can be reliably predicted from passive data with at least 85% accuracy. The second is the user design and system architecture of MoodRing. If milestones are achieved that models are successful at predicting depressive symptoms and the proposed MoodRing intervention is acceptable to adolescents, par- ents, and primary care providers/care managers, then we will pursue the STTR Phase II study. The aims of Phase II include the development and subsequent efficacy trial of MoodRing. Specifically, we will conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial in a primary care setting of MoodRing as compared to usual care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Depression affects up to a fifth of adolescents but less than half get treatment. This project aims to develop and design MoodRing, a technology platform, which will gather information about how an adolescent uses their mobile phone and translate that into what it means about symptoms of depression they are experiencing. This platform will provide symptom feedback to the adolescent themselves, their parent, and their healthcare pro- vider, with the goal that having awareness of symptoms and a safe place to communicate with parents and healthcare providers will allow for more adolescents to better self-manage their mood and get better quality treatment for depression.",MoodRing: A multi-stakeholder platform to

"Data Driven Strategies for Substance Misuse Identification in Hospitalized Patients PROJECT SUMMARY  The rate of substance use-related hospital visits in the US continues to increase, and now outpaces visits for heart disease and respiratory failure. The prevalence of substance misuse (nonmedical use of opioids and/or benzodiazepines, illicit drugs, and/or alcohol) in hospitalized patients is estimated to be 15%-25% and far exceeds the prevalence in the general population. With over 35 million hospitalized patients per year, tens of millions of patients are not screened for substance misuse during their stay. Despite the recommendation for self-report questionnaires (single-question universal screens, Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test [AUDIT], Drug Abuse Screening Tool [DAST]), screening rates remains low in hospitals. Current screening methods are resource-intensive, so a comprehensive and automated approach to substance misuse screening that will augment current clinical workflow would therefore be of great utility.  In the advent of Meaningful Use in the electronic health record (EHR), efficiency for substance misuse detection may be improved by leveraging data collected during usual care. Documentation of substance use is common and occurs in 97% of provider admission notes, but their free text format renders them difficult to mine and analyze. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning are subfields of artificial intelligence (AI) that provide a solution to analyze text data in the EHR to identify substance misuse. Modern NLP has fused with machine learning, another sub-field of AI focused on learning from data. In particular, the most powerful NLP methods rely on supervised learning, a type of machine learning that takes advantage of current reference standards to make predictions about unseen cases  In our earlier version of an NLP and machine learning tool, our opioid and alcohol misuse classifiers successfully used data from clinical notes collected in the first 24 hours of hospital admission to reach a sensitivity and specificity above 75% for detecting alcohol or opioid misuse. We will improve the performance of our baseline, individual NLP single-substance classifiers for alcohol and opioid misuse by implementing multi-label and multi-task machine learning methods. These methods will take advantage of information shared across different types of substance misuse and better capture the state of a patient within a single model. The resulting classifier will be capable of jointly inferring all types of substance misuse (alcohol misuse, opioid misuse, and non-opioid illicit misuse) including polysubstance use, and cater to each individual patient’s substance use treatment needs.  We aim to train and test our substance misuse classifiers at Rush in a retrospective dataset of over 35,000 hospitalizations that have been manually screened with the universal screen, AUDIT, and DAST. The top performing classifier will then be tested prospectively to: (1) externally validate its screening performance in a hospital without established screening; and (2) test its effectiveness against usual care at a hospital with questionnaire-based substance misuse screening. We hypothesize that a single-model NLP substance misuse classifier will provide a standardized, interoperable, and accurate approach for universal screening in hospitalized patients and guiding interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE We anticipate that the research proposed will provide novel and critically important tools in artificial intelligence for the detection of substance misuse from the electronic health record (EHR). Development and validation of the substance misuse classifier would enable a standardized approach to perform screening on all patient encounters on a daily basis in health systems. We will rigorously develop and test substance misuse classifier retrospectively and then examine its performance prospectively in both a naïve and mature screening program.

"Using Neuroimaging Markers to Understand Risk Factors and Consequences of Cannabis on Brain Structure and Function Project Summary This application for an Independent Scientist Award (K02) requests support to develop a program of brain-based and behavioral research on substance use disorders (SUD), especially cannabis use disorder (CUD). My laboratory is supported in part by a funded R01 (DA039135) that seeks to understand the effects of medical marijuana on the brain, cognition, and escalation to CUD. In the next phase of my career, I propose to learn enhanced analytical techniques (e.g. machine learning and predictive modeling) that can capitalize on newly-available, large, longitudinal datasets that can answer fundamental questions about the development of SUD that cannot be answered in small populations. In addition, I propose a secondary training goal of gaining expertise in developmental neuroscience, to broaden the populations I can study to include children and adolescents at-risk for SUD. Together, these skillsets will allow me to greatly expand the types of questions I can ask, by allowing me to answer questions about SUD using both large observational data-sets, and also targeted experimental manipulations (such as my R01). My goal at the end of this K02 to have the tools to not only use big data to better understand risk factors and consequences of addiction in large samples, but also to use this knowledge to inform future experimental studies and clinical trials that I can conduct in my lab.  The scientific focus of this application is a research project, using the publicly-available Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) dataset of 11,877 children scanned longitudinally, to understand how trajectories of change in impulsivity associate with brain-based abnormalities and SUD risk. The aims for the ABCD analysis project are to (1) define the factorial structure of impulsivity in the ABCD dataset as it may portend SUD risk (using a confirmatory factor model which will be applied to the array of behavioral tasks, self- report measures, and parent reports), (2) determine structural and functional brain measures that correlate with impulsivity, and (3) examine how longitudinal changes in brain signatures of impulsivity are associated with risk for SUD. To accomplish these aims, I will participate in courses and train with collaborators with expertise in developmental neuroscience and in statistical analyses of big data. The skills I learn in the K02 period will be used not only to query the ABCD dataset, but also to enhance the sophistication of neuroimaging analyses of my R01 data and any future data collected in my laboratory. This training will enhance my laboratory by significantly expanding the questions I can address, improving my analytic skills, furthering my ability to collaborate, and providing a foundation for mentoring junior scientists. In the absence of K02 support, I will need to cover my salary through teaching and administrative work, which would detract from my research, training, and mentoring activities. This K02 award will provide protected time to develop my research program and receive this training that will be critical for my career development as an addiction neuroscientist. Project Narrative This K02 Independent Scientist Award will provide protected research time for the PI to develop an integrated program of brain-based and behavioral research on substance use disorders (SUD), especially cannabis use disorder (CUD). This award will provide protected time for training in (1) statistical analysis as it pertains to big data, in light of the shift in the neuroimaging field toward large consortia-collected datasets, and (2) developmental neuroscience. This training will enhance the PI’s laboratory through significantly expanding the questions she can address, improving her analytic skills, furthering her ability to collaborate, and providing a solid and growing foundation for mentoring junior scientists.",Using Neuroimaging Markers to Understand Risk Factors and Consequences of Cannabis on Brain Structure and Function,10301282,K02DA052684,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Award ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' indexing ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Running ', ' Wages ', ' Salaries ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' Lasso ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Solid ', ' Phase ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Training ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Data Storage and Retrieval ', ' data retrieval ', ' data storage ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' Visit ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Reporting ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' theories ', ' Cannabis ', ' Address ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' K02 Award ', ' Independent Scientist Award ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Research Training ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' vector ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Population ', ' parallel computer ', ' parallel computation ', ' parallel computing ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' Medical Marijuana ', ' Medicinal Marijuana ', ' medical cannabis ', ' medicinal cannabis ', ' therapeutic cannabis ', ' therapeutic marijuana ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' marijuana use disorder ', ' cannabis use disorder ', ' cognitive development ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' neural correlate ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' neuroimaging marker ', ' neuroimaging biomarker ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' detection method ', ' detection procedure ', ' detection technique ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' ']",NIDA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K02,2021,128304,MA-08
"Smart Technology for Anorexia Nervosa Recovery: A Pilot Intervention for the Post-Acute Treatment of Anorexia Nervosa PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Anorexia nervosa (AN) has the highest mortality rate of any mental illness, with a typical onset in adolescence. Although family-based interventions are efficacious for up to 75% of adolescents with AN, approximately 30% will relapse after recovery. There is a critical need to optimize treatments and prevent post-discharge relapse following acute treatment to improve outcomes for adolescents with AN. To address this critical need, our team developed a suite of digital tools that advance the science of assessment, risk prediction, and clinical-decision support for use in the post-acute treatment window, called “Smart Treatment for Anorexia Recovery (STAR).” STAR uses cutting-edge assessment technology to shorten test administration and machine-learning to predict likelihood of recovery. This information is then provided back to the clinician via an easy-to-use clinical- decision support tool to alert the clinician when user-entered data suggests the patient is not progressing. In the current application, we propose to expand STAR to test an adaptive mHealth intervention delivered in the post-discharge window. Our scientific premise is that a transdiagnostic assessment and clinical-decision support tool delivered within the STAR suite will optimize face-to-face clinical service and the addition of an adaptive mHealth intervention will improve outpatient treatment response and reduce relapse in adolescents discharged from intensive treatment for AN. Our previous work supports our scientific premise. Specifically, our studies provide robust support for the predictive validity and clinical utility of our assessment tool for predicting ED-related psychiatric impairment and recovery. However, the number of items across our paper-based assessment tool is 144, which is overly long for routine use. To overcome this challenge, we developed a mobile phone app that uses computerized adaptive testing to reduce assessment length by up to 50% while retaining the reliability and validity of the original paper-and-pencil measure. We propose to leverage this innovation to optimize both face-to-face and mHealth treatment for AN. Our objectives are to: 1) develop the mHealth intervention (with clinician and stakeholder input) and 2) establish feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effect size of our mHealth intervention using both clinician and patient data. To accomplish our objectives, we will employ a computerized adaptive test coupled with machine learning algorithms, delivered within our app to signal clinicians when their clients are at-risk for poor outcomes and relapse. Specific aims include: 1) adapt our existing clinical tool to provide therapist support modules and patient mHealth messages; 2) conduct a preliminary randomized controlled trial (RCT) of our integrated assessment and mHealth intervention tool ; 3) test preliminary mechanisms that lead to changes in AN symptoms. Given there is a scarcity of specialty care for AN following acute treatment, yet 95% of adolescents have smart phones, the proposed research is innovative and significant because it has the future potential to reduce relapse and optimize existing community-delivered interventions for AN over the post-acute treatment window. PROJECT NARRATIVE AN is the third leading cause of chronic illness in adolescents and, if left untreated, can lead to major organ damage, structural and functional brain changes, and early-onset osteopenia and osteoporosis. The proposed research is, therefore, relevant to public health because a transdiagnostic assessment and clinical-decision support tool will optimize face-to-face clinical service and the addition of an adaptive mHealth intervention has the potential to improve post-acute community-based outpatient treatment response in adolescents with anorexia nervosa. The proposed research is relevant to the NIH’s mission to tailor existing interventions to optimize outcomes and to test interventions for effectiveness in community practice settings (see NIMH’s Goal 3: Strive for Prevention and Cures).",Smart Technology for Anorexia Nervosa Recovery: A Pilot Intervention for the Post-Acute Treatment of Anorexia Nervosa,10284797,R34MH127022,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Anorexia ', ' Anorexia Nervosa ', ' Anxiety ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Client ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Eating Disorders ', ' Emotions ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mission ', ' Moods ', ' mortality ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Osteopenia ', ' Osteopenias ', ' Osteoporosis ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Relapse ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Technology ', ' Technology Assessment ', ' Testing ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' body weight loss ', ' wt-loss ', ' Work ', ' Inosine Dialdehyde ', ' Diglycolaldehyde ', ' IdA ', ' Inox ', ' Measures ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' satisfaction ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Notification ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Community Practice ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Clinical Services ', ' Output ', ' early onset ', ' post intervention ', ' digital ', ' computerized ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' usability ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' routine practice ', ' clinical practice ', ' eating pathology ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' adolescent patient ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' anxious symptom ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' support tools ', ' improved outcome ', ' predictive tools ', ' practice setting ', ' clinical decision support ', ' treatment optimization ', ' therapy optimization ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' efficacious intervention ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS LAWRENCE,R34,2021,242277,KS-02
"Predicting Substance Use among Military Veterans with a Positive MST Screen: A Machine Learning Approach Project Summary/Abstract Military sexual trauma (MST) is a serious and pervasive problem among military populations, affecting approximately 16% of military personnel and veterans [1]. Substance use disproportionately affects individuals with a history of MST. Individuals with (vs. without) a history of MST are twice as likely to misuse substances [2-4]. Substance use among military samples has been linked to higher rates of negative consequences across several domains (e.g., health, occupational, legal [5, 6]), including death (e.g., overdose [7], traffic accidents [8], suicide [7, 8]). Further, while understudied among individuals with a history of MST in particular, negative substance use outcomes have been shown to be more severe among trauma-exposed populations, including more severe clinical presentations and poorer treatment prognosis [9, 10]. These findings emphasize the importance of clarifying the association between MST and substance use among military populations. Despite the clinical relevance and public health significance of substance use among military populations, research in this area has relied almost exclusively on cross-sectional designs. Moreover, the vast majority of studies in this area have utilized traditional statistical methods, which are limited in scope and capabilities. These limitations have important clinical implications, as they restrict our ability to specify the exact nature and directionality of the relationship between MST and substance use, thereby affecting how findings are translated into prevention and intervention efforts. The proposed research aims to fill these critical gaps by utilizing the Army STARRS pre/post-deployment study, a large, prospective military dataset to: (1) explicate the directional relation between MST and substance use using a longitudinal dataset, and (2) employ machine learning methods to develop an algorithm to optimize detection of substance use in military personnel with a history of MST. These findings will assist in elucidating the etiology of substance use among this high-risk group, as well as provide a prediction model for clinical use to better target at-risk individuals in this population. This research project will take place within the Department of Psychology at the University of Rhode Island; an institution with a strong history and commitment to health behavior research and methodology. The applicant will have access to sponsors and consultants with expertise in MST, substance use, advanced methodology, and statistical analysis that will facilitate her career objectives to develop increased knowledge and proficiency in (a) sexual trauma (e.g., MST) and substance use in military veterans; (b) grant/manuscript development; (c) statistical and methodological capabilities (i.e., machine learning); and (d) big data. The proposed project uses a timely and innovative approach to advance science on the relation between MST and substance use in military personnel. Addressing substance use in this population is necessary to improve the health of our nation's veterans, and aligns with the mission of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Project Narrative Military sexual trauma (MST) is highly prevalent among military personnel and is associated with disproportionate rates of substance use. By explicating the directional relation between MST and substance use, and utilizing machine learning to develop high-quality prediction models for clinical use, the proposed study will inform prevention and intervention efforts for this high-risk group. Findings will be used to improve clinical outcomes among military personnel with exposure to MST, and reduce the onset and maintenance of problematic substance use and associated negative consequences.",Predicting Substance Use among Military Veterans with a Positive MST Screen: A Machine Learning Approach,10458304,F31DA051167,"['Traffic accidents ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Maintenance ', ' Maps ', ' Methodology ', ' Military Personnel ', ' Armed Forces Personnel ', ' Military ', ' military population ', ' Mission ', ' Overdose ', ' Psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rhode Island ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Self Medication ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States Department of Veterans Affairs ', ' United States Veterans Administration ', ' Veterans Administration ', ' Veterans Affairs ', ' Universities ', ' Veterans ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Sexual Harassment ', ' Sexual Harrassment ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Distress ', ' sexual assault ', ' assaulted sexually ', ' sexual attack ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Exposure to ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Occupational ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Manuscripts ', ' skills ', ' high risk behavior ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Institution ', ' Legal ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' Population-based research ', ' Population-level research ', ' Population Research ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' intervention for prevention ', ' prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' preventive intervention ', ' To specify ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Output ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' sexual trauma ', ' Impairment ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' stem ', ' high risk ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' substance misuse ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' Service provision ', ' trauma exposure ', ' exposure to trauma ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' military veteran ', ' veteran population ', ' military service ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF RHODE ISLAND,F31,2021,2500,RI-02
"A Software Product That Empowers Individuals Affected By Substance Use Disorders and Their Care Teams with Health and Social Resources Project Summary Access and participation in community resource programs such as transportation, housing and medication assistance - also known as social determinants of health (SDOH) is inextricably linked to a successful treatment and recovery in substance use disorders (SUD). Therefore, health and social service providers dedicate a significant amount of time to curate local community resource listings or “referral binders”. These “referral binders” are often highly duplicated and fragmented across organizations and by using expensive non-scalable solutions technology vendors in this domain have not fully addressed this problem. Furthermore, participation in such community programs is also hindered by the absence of highly efficient program eligibility screening tools. Undoubtedly, these shortcomings contribute to lack of direct access to recovery capital for individuals affected by SUD.  We report two feasibility outcomes from our SBIR Phase I study. 1) A novel co-creation led business model that leverages local partnerships with subject matter expertise agencies on SUD and SDOH - can provide enhanced access to community resource programs at the point-of-care. 2) A highly adaptive digital assisted SDOH screening tool powered by novel conversational artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) technologies can enhance patients’ participation in SDOH related community programs. This is achieved by using these technologies to perform program eligibility screenings through both web and text messaging channels coupled with patient triaging within a case work team. The purpose of this Phase II study is to: 1) Optimize and scale the community resource co-creation business model established in Phase I by onboarding eight co-creation partners in Texas within 2 years. 2) Examine the relationship between the conversational AI and NLP powered SDOH screening tool piloted in Phase I with SUD outcomes among youths and young adults. Specifically, we will partner with the Harris Center for Mental Health and IDD - the largest outpatient mental health provider in Texas to examine whether youths screened and enrolled into a treatment program using our technology report improved SUD outcomes. As AI and NLP are core pillars of our technology we will also investigate and subsequently correct for potential societal biases and stereotypes (e.g. race, gender) encoded in such technologies. This effort will avoid such biases to inadvertently determine outcomes in our downstream prediction tasks. The key Phase II milestones include; 1) Demonstrable evidence that the co-creation business model leads to enhanced access to SDOH and SUD community resources at the point-of-care. 2) An understanding on whether screening and eventual participation in a treatment program as supported by our conversational AI technology can lead to reduced encounters with law enforcement including CPS among youths with mental health and SUD. In summary, the proposed Phase II work will lead to enhanced access to SUD recovery capital and facilitate patients’ participation in local health and SDOH community programs. Project Narrative Social factors such as housing, transportation and medication have a significant impact on substance use treatment and recovery outcomes. This Phase II proposal will expand our co-creation model that leverages local community partnerships to curate community resources. In addition, our AI powered digital assisted SDOH screening tool will identify eligible patients and connect them to the services to improve the efficiency of patient screening and intake process.",A Software Product That Empowers Individuals Affected By Substance Use Disorders and Their Care Teams with Health and Social Resources,10360396,R44DA051063,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Capital ', ' Client ', ' Communities ', ' Counseling ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Employment ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Health Services ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Housing ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Manuals ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patient Participation ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Privatization ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Relapse ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Transportation ', ' United States ', ' Vendor ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Businesses ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Caring ', ' Social Impacts ', ' Law Enforcement ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Distal ', ' Phase ', ' Sex Bias ', ' Gender Bias ', ' Sexism ', ' Link ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' non-compliant ', ' noncompliance ', ' noncompliant ', ' non-compliance ', ' Services ', ' mental health center ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' treatment program ', ' child protection services ', ' child protective service ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral health ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' community-based health ', ' point of care ', ' digital ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Coupled ', ' service utilization ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' social health determinants ', ' phase 1 study ', ' Phase I Study ', ' phase 2 study ', ' phase II study ', ' screening ', ' Patient Triage ', ' community partnership ', ' racial bias ', ' race bias ', ' opioid overdose ', ' opiate overdose ', ' opiate related overdose ', ' opioid drug overdose ', ' opioid induced overdose ', ' opioid intoxication ', ' opioid medication overdose ', ' opioid poisoning ', ' opioid related overdose ', ' opioid toxicity ', ' recruit ', ' Text Messaging ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' service programs ', ' patient screening ', ' service providers ', ' societal costs ', ' treatment risk ', ' social factors ', ' substance use treatment ', ' ']",NIDA,"MEDICAL INNOVATORS COMPANY, LLC",R44,2021,425535,TX-07
"Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network Project Summary/Abstract  This proposal is a competing renewal application of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN), which joined the CTN in 2015. The Northeast Node brought hundreds of community and healthcare partners across the states of New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine to the CTN community for the first time. These states have among the very highest rates of substance use in the U.S., including opioid use, and they include some of the most rural communities in the U.S. The Node has brought significant expertise to the CTN in conducting practical, rigorous, innovative, and highly impactful trials focused on improving the treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs) in community systems in the Northeast and in partnership with other CTN Nodes across the nation. Node Investigators have extensive experience in leading national and multi-national clinical trials, digital technology; medication and behavioral treatments for opioid use disorder; co-occurring SUDs and mental health disorders; SUD and chronic pain; SUD in pregnant women; opioid, cannabis, tobacco, alcohol, stimulant, and polydrug treatment; SUD prevention and treatment among youth; and implementation science. The Northeast Node is embedded within the Center for Technology and Behavioral Health (CTBH), a NIDA-funded P30 “Center of Excellence”. The Node thus brings significant expertise in developing, evaluating, and implementing digital treatments for SUDs, with a focus on overcoming the striking disparities in treatment access and treatment quality evident in healthcare across the globe.  In the renewal period, the Node proposes to enhance its activities and contributions to the national CTN to embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for SUDs. The Node will engage a broader group of investigators that bring additional expertise in data science (bioinformatics, predictive modeling, artificial intelligence, social media, data privacy/security) and experimental design (micro-randomized trials, adaptive designs, and implementation/systems science). With this expanded group of partners, it will support and grow a productive research agenda in the CTN with a focus on (a) digital health and data analytics, including research focused on providing personalized, science-based resources to individuals with SUD via digital technology and (b) expanding low threshold access to science-based SUD care, particularly in rural contexts (e.g., general medical settings; pharmacies; and community organizations). And the Node will lead an expansion of CTN research on the (c) rapidly evolving landscape of cannabis use as well as (d) co-morbid SUD and mental health disorders. The Node will establish Community and Policy Advisory Boards to complement the existing communication infrastructure between Node investigators and their partners, with a focus on identifying the most significant and timely SUD needs in our communities and scaling-up and sustaining best practices. Project Narrative The proposed activities of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for substance use disorders (SUD). These activities reflect a vision for the next iteration of the CTN in the next 5 years. This work will advance translational science in SUD research and markedly reduce the gap between SUD research and clinical practice -- with a focus on scaling-up and sustaining best practices.",Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network,10387466,UG1DA040309,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Artificial

"RAE (Realize, Analyze, Engage)- A Digital Biomarker Based Detection and Intervention System for Stress and Craving During Recovery from Substance Abuse Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The research project outlined in this SBIR submission will develop the Realize, Analyze, Engage (RAE) platform into a tool to promote sustained recovery in individuals receiving treatment for substance use disorder. In this proposal, the investigators intend to deploy the RAE system- consisting of a wearable sensor, a smartphone app, and a clinical portal- to provide individuals in recovery and their treatment providers with an opportunity to identify moments of high risk for relapse and to access real time intervention opportunities. Wearable biosensors are small, noninvasive devices that continuously record physiology. These sensors have the ability to detect digital biomarkers of drug use and stress, the latter of which herald an increased risk of relapse. RAE aims to utilize this capability to create a real-time solution for individuals in recovery. The components of RAE are: 1) The Empatica Embrace, a wrist mounted sensor similar in form factor to a smart watch, that continuously monitors skin temperature, electrodermal activity (EDA) and locomotion. Detection algorithms for stress and drug use will be embedded on the Embrace firmware. 2) The RAE smartphone application (app), for the individual in recovery. The app will be triggered either by detection of an event on the Embrace or manually by the user when needed and will provide multiple options for annotations, stress reduction techniques and immediate contact with individuals in the pre-defined support system via call or SMS text. The app will also log sleep, physical activity, and geographic location of events. 3) The RAE Portal, for the treatment provider, will deliver immediate alerts when an event is detected on the user’s device for the opportunity to intervene in real time and will also provide metrics on the user’s recorded activities. The research plan has two Specific Aims: Aim 1) To deploy and optimize the RAE system in a population of individuals in treatment for substance use disorder and Aim 2) To demonstrate the impact of the RAE system on outcomes in substance use treatment. To achieve these aims the investigators will first deploy the technology in a population of individuals in recovery and collect data on accuracy, usability and functionality (Aim 1). The data from Aim 1 will be used to optimize the system and achieve millstones prior to transition to Aim 2 which will include sensitivity, specify, accuracy and user compliance targets. The investigators will then undertake a multi-site, randomized controlled trial (Aim 2) to evaluate the efficacy of RAE on key outcomes including rates of relapse, retention in treatment programs, and psychosocial wellbeing. The investigators have assembled a leadership team and advisory team with the necessary expertise in business, medicine, wearable technology and engineering to develop RAE into a tool that dramatically improves the success of treatment for substance use disorder, promotes sustained sobriety, and reduces morbidity and mortality from relapse to substance use. PROJECT NARRATIVE Morbidity and mortality related to substance use disorder has reached staggering proportions, and treatment options suffer from high rates of relapse. RAE (Realize, Analyze, Engage) is a mobile based solution that combines a wearable sensor, a smartphone app and a cloud based clinical portal to detect stress and drug use in individuals in treatment for substance use disorder. The goal of the RAE system is to provide real-time intervention tools for patients, to allow clinicians to personalize the treatment approach for each patient, and ultimately to reduce morbidity and mortality from substance use disorder by improving the success of treatment programs.","RAE (Realize, Analyze, Engage)- A Digital Biomarker Based Detection and Intervention System for Stress and Craving During Recovery from Substance Abuse Disorders",10356481,R44DA046151,"['Algorithms ', ' Anxiety ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Explosion ', ' Foundations ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Industry ', ' Italy ', ' Leadership ', ' Locomotion ', ' Manuals ', ' Medicine ', ' Morbidity -

"Analyzing Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trials in the Presence of Partial Compliance Project Summary: The cyclical and heterogeneous nature of many substance use disorders highlights the need to adapt the type or the dose of treatment to accommodate the specific and changing needs of individuals. This proposal is motivated by the Extending Treatment Effectiveness of Naltrexone and the Adaptive Treatment for Cocaine Dependence trials, sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMART) designed to find a (personalized) rescue treatment for alcohol or/and cocaine dependent patients. One of the main challenges in these trials is the high rate of noncompliance to the assigned treatments. This feature has made it virtually impossible for investigators to fully explore the possibility of building high quality treatment strategies using the data. Our overarching aim is to address this particular challenge through developing and subsequently applying new statistical methods to the data. A SMART trial is a multi-stage trial that can inform the design of an adaptive treatment strategy (ATS) which formalizes an individualized treatment plan and where current treatment strategy can depend on a patient's past medical and treatment history. An optimal ATS is one that maximizes a specified health outcome of interest. Existing methods in analyzing SMART data are limited to intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses. That is the treatment effect at each stage is estimated based on the treatment group to which an individual was randomized at that stage regardless of whether the individual complied with their assigned treatment. One major concern is that the relationship between the experimental manipulation and the outcome may be confounded by treatment noncompliance. We develop methodologies that can be used to adjust for noncompliance in analyzing data collected in SMARTs. Specifically, we extend the principal strata framework and Bayesian Copulas to multi-stage randomized trials setting and propose novel procedures that estimate the mean outcome under different ATSs. We also propose a novel Bayesian machine learning approach that can be used to construct deeply tailored (i.e., individualized) treatment strategies that take into account patients' demographic factors, measures of mental health and alcohol use, obsessive-compulsive drinking and alcohol craving scales, physical composite scores. Finally, we will develop easy-to-use, publicly available open-source software leveraging the R and Python languages that implements our methods. This will provide an expandable platform that will assist researchers in developing new optimal ATSs for patients suffering from alcoholism and other substance use disorders. Narrative: This project aims to address the need for robust, rigorous and computationally efficient methods for analysis of sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMARTs) data in the presence of partial compliance. The methods developed in this project will improve the usefulness, interpretability and generalizability of the results obtained by SMARTs and help mental health and substance use disorder scientists to develop more potent adaptive treatment strategies to guide the individualization of mental health and substance use disorder treatments.","Analyzing Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trials in the Presence of Partial Compliance",10227064,R01DA048764,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Cocaine ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Joints ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Maps ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Naltrexone ', ' Nalorex ', ' Nemexin ', ' ReVia ', ' Vivitrol ', ' Patients ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' statistics ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Medical ', ' Pythons ', ' Individual ', ' Bayesian Method ', ' Bayesian Methodology ', ' Bayesian Statistical Method ', ' Bayesian approaches ', ' Bayesian classification method ', ' Bayesian classification procedure ', ' Bayesian posterior distribution ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Scientist ', ' non-compliant ', ' noncompliance ', ' noncompliant ', ' non-compliance ', ' interest ', ' ethanol craving ', ' alcohol craving ', ' Performance ', ' treatment planning ', ' obsessive compulsive ', ' Obsessive compulsive behavior ', ' Cocaine Addiction ', ' Cocaine Dependence ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' drinking ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' response ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' alcohol abuse treatment ', ' alcohol treatment ', ' alcohol abuse therapy ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' patient cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' treatment compliance ', ' compliance behavior ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Stratification ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Scheme ', ' Characteristics ', ' virtual ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Alcoholism ', ' treatment effect ', ' open source ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment strategy ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' arm ', ' individualized medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapeutic strategy ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' trial design ', ' treatment group ', ' patient response ', ' patient specific response ', ' responsive patient ', ' Bayesian learning ', ' Bayesian machine learning ', ' Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2021,384135,NY-25
"Mechanisms and Predictors of Change in App-Based Mindfulness Training for Adolescents Project Summary/Abstract Mindfulness-based smartphone apps have surged in popularity in recent years. Headspace – among the most popular of these platforms – has over 42 million users. Recent surveys indicate that 11% of U.S. adolescents have used mindfulness apps as a means of coping with anxiety or depressive symptoms, which increase substantially during the adolescent years. A growing body of research implicates rumination as being a transdiagnostic risk factor involved in the development of depression and anxiety in youth. Critically, mindfulness meditation has shown significant promise in targeting rumination, and ultimately improving depressive and anxiety symptoms. Mindfulness apps offer a convenient and cost-effective means for accessing mindfulness training, while being interactive and engaging for youth. Despite their growing popularity among teens, strikingly little research has been conducted on these apps. Two critical questions have yet to be addressed, which are strongly aligned with the NCCIH Strategic Plan: (1) what are the underlying neural and cognitive mechanisms that account for the beneficial effects of these apps and (2) for whom is app-based mindfulness well-suited. To address these gaps, adolescents (ages 13-18) will be randomly assigned to an app-delivered mindfulness course vs. an active control condition and will complete pre- and post-intervention resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans to probe static and dynamic functional connectivity within – and between – brain networks strongly implicated in mindfulness training and rumination (i.e., Default Mode Network and Salience Network). In addition, cognitive tasks will be administered at pre- and post-intervention to assess attentional control abilities putatively enhanced by mindfulness training. Finally, mindfulness skills and changes in rumination will be assessed via a smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) protocol developed in the PI’s lab. First, we will test whether changes in (1) brain functional connectivity, (2) attentional control and (3) acquisition and use of mindfulness skills mediate between-group (i.e., app vs. control) differences in the reduction of rumination. Second, we will test whether a machine learning model incorporating baseline clinical, demographic, and psychosocial characteristics can be used to identify which adolescents are predicted to benefit from app-based mindfulness training. Recent advances in machine learning allow for the development of algorithms predicting outcome at the individual level, as well as the integration of numerous predictors rather than relying on single variables that may, in isolation, have limited clinically-useful predictive value. Ultimately, such an algorithm may inform individual risk-benefit assessments that could be used to objectively communicate the probability of experiencing positive vs. adverse outcomes to users prior to engaging with a mindfulness app. Collectively, results are expected to advance (1) our understanding of the underlying mechanisms that account for the beneficial effects of app-based mindfulness training and (2) our ability to predict which adolescents are well-suited to these increasingly popular apps. Project Narrative Mindfulness-based smartphone apps have surged in popularity in recent years (e.g., the Headspace app has over 42 million users). An estimated 11% of U.S. adolescents have used mindfulness apps as a means of coping with symptoms of depression and anxiety, which increase substantially during the adolescent years, and which have been repeatedly linked to rumination in youth. The research activities of the proposed R01 will investigate the underlying neural and cognitive mechanisms that account for the beneficial effects of these apps on rumination, and a machine learning algorithm will be developed to predict which specific adolescents are expected to benefit from app-based mindfulness training.",Mechanisms and Predictors of Change in App-Based Mindfulness Training for Adolescents,10207235,R01AT011002,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anxiety ', ' Attention ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Control Groups ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Emotions ', ' Goals ', ' Persons ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Panic ', ' Probability ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Research Activity ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Risk-Benefit Assessment ', ' psychosocial ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Modeling ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Predictive Value ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Cognitive ', ' Teenagers ', ' Teen ', ' teen years ', ' teenage ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' active control ', ' post intervention ', ' cost ', ' efficacy evaluation ', ' efficacy analysis ', ' efficacy assessment ', ' efficacy examination ', ' evaluate efficacy ', ' examine efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' coping ', ' Prevalence ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Coupled ', ' Affective ', ' mindfulness ', ' mindfulness meditation ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' anxious symptom ', ' cognitive task ', ' attentional control ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' predicting response ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' functional MRI scan ', ' fMRI scan ', ' functional magnetic resonance imaging scan ', ' smartphone Application ', ' Android App ', ' Android Application ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smartphone App ', ' iOS app ', ' iOS application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iPhone Application ', ' Mindfulness Training ', ' Mindfulness Approach ', ' Mindfulness Therapy ', ' Mindfulness Treatment ', ' Mindfulness-based Approach ', ' Mindfulness-based Therapy ', ' Mindfulness-based Training ', ' Mindfulness-based Treatment ', ' personalized predictions ', ' Individualized Predictors ', ' individualized predictions ', ' personalized predictors ', ' Grain ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' algorithm development ', ' kernel methods ', ' kernel learning ', ' multi-kernel learning ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NCCIH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2021,660856,MA-05
"Leveraging computational models of neurocognition to improve predictions about individual youths' risk for substance use disorders PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This K23 proposal seeks to provide an early-career clinical psychologist and neuroscientist (Dr. Alexander Weigard) with the mentorship, training, and resources necessary to launch a career as an independent patient- oriented investigator focused on using advanced computational methods to elucidate etiological mechanisms of substance use disorders (SUDs) and generate meaningful predictions for patients. The candidate will work towards this long-term goal through the completion of a research project focused on assessing whether two advanced computational methods can facilitate the selection of features from neuroscientific data that are relevant for the individualized prediction of SUD risk in youth. Although extant research in developmental neuroscience has identified multiple early risk factors that are associated with development of SUD at the group level, there is currently a dearth of large scale, replicable research in which neurocognitive data are used to make reliable and generalizable predictions of SUD outcomes for individual youth. In the proposed project, the candidate will combine his existing expertise in computational models of cognition with new training in predictive informatics methods to assess whether two advanced computational approaches, a) sequential sampling models (SSMs) of cognition and b) network neuroscience, can be used to extract features from longitudinal neurocognitive data that enhance the prediction of youths’ SUD outcomes. The candidate will conduct extensive analyses with two large data sets (Michigan Longitudinal Study, Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study) and collect pilot data with 60 young adults to accomplish the following research aims: 1) Quantify the added benefit of SSM parameters for improving the performance of multivariate SUD prediction models, and 2) Identify the multivariate neural signature of v, an SSM parameter with promising links to substance use, and determine the potential of this signature for predicting a precursor to SUD (substance use initiation in mid-adolescence) in ABCD and differentiating young adults with SUDs in the newly-collected pilot sample. Completion of the following training objectives will ensure that the candidate can both carry out the proposed project and establish himself as an independent investigator who is well-equipped to conduct future projects following from this work: 1) Mastering principles of machine learning model development and testing in longitudinal data sets, 2) building expertise in using multivariate network neuroscience methods for feature selection and prediction, 3) increasing clinical and epidemiological knowledge of SUD risk factors beyond neurocognition, and 4) improving professional skills necessary to become an independent patient-oriented investigator. The proposed K23 aims to take a crucial step towards the development of advanced computational neuroscience methods that may ultimately inform SUD prevention efforts by identifying reliable predictors of individuals’ SUD risk, and to set the candidate up to independently conduct leading edge research in the interest of this larger goal. PROJECT NARRATIVE Decades of developmental neuroscience research have illuminated multiple factors that convey risk for the development of substance use disorders (SUDs) at the group level, but the field currently lacks methods for using neurocognitive data to make accurate and generalizable predictions about SUD risk for individual youth. The proposed project seeks to address this critical gap in the field by providing an early-career scientist with the tools and training necessary to test whether the combination of two advanced computational approaches, sequential sampling models of cognitive functioning and network neuroscience methods, improve the accuracy of multivariate predictive models of individuals’ SUD risk.

"Modified Use of E-cigarettes and Marketing on YouTube PROJECT SUMMARY I was awarded my first R01 (parent grant) on June 1, 2020. However, the university-wide hiring freeze due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the birth of my child and maternity leave set back the project progress. Thus, this Administrative Supplement, which is focused on supporting first-time grantees who experienced critical life events, will be used to catch up on the delayed progress from Year 1 of the parent grant. Please note that the Specific Aims of this Supplement remain the same as those of the parent grant. The overall goal of the parent grant is to understand ways in which youth modify e-cigarettes, their motivations for doing so, and marketing sources, using YouTube analysis, survey methodology, and expert evaluation. We will identify modified uses of e-cigarettes and marketing using fictitious youth YouTube viewer profiles to search for e-cigarettes using a browser plug-in and custom scripted web-crawling and then machine learning to automatically code the videos to identify e-cigarette modifications and marketing source. Our Advisory Committee (AC) of subject matter experts in tobacco regulatory science, social media, youth tobacco use, toxicology, communications, and tobacco marketing will apply their knowledge to assess the potential impact of these identified modified uses on appeal, addiction, and health effects of e-cigarettes to identify those which are amenable to FDA regulations and communications. We will then conduct an in-depth analysis of these selected behaviors using a combination of machine learning and detailed human coding on youth-accessible YouTube videos to understand: 1) components that are modified (e.g., batteries, cartridges/pods, e-liquids), 2) motivations for modification (e.g., enhance user experience, reduce perceived harm), 3) marketing sources (e.g., online shops, pro-e-cigarette organizations), and 4) appeal (number of likes, views). We will also use an online survey with adolescent and young adult e-cigarette users (N=1000) to examine the prevalence, appeal, motivations, risk perceptions, and marketing exposure related to these modified uses and their predictors (i.e., demographic variables, past-month e-cigarette use frequency, e-cigarette dependence, other tobacco/substance use, interpersonal and intrapersonal risk factors). The results of this study will provide the FDA with novel evidence to 1) develop regulations to prohibit the manufacturing and marketing of e-cigarette components that can be modified by youth, 2) restrict youth-accessible marketing of e-cigarettes on social media such as YouTube, and 3) develop prevention campaigns to educate youth about the harms of modifying e-cigarettes. PROJECT NARRATIVE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: E-cigarette use among youth is high; thus, to inform youth e-cigarette prevention, we will examine the youth appeal of the product, such as the ability to modify or “hack” the devices and their related components for unintended uses and marketing on popular social media, YouTube. We will use mixed-methods (i.e., machine learning, survey methodology, expert evaluation) to achieve our aim. The results of this study will provide the FDA with novel evidence to develop regulations to prohibit the manufacturing and marketing of e-cigarette components that can be modified, restrict youth-accessible marketing of e-cigarettes on YouTube, and develop prevention campaigns to educate youth about the harms of engaging in these behaviors.",Modified Use of E-cigarettes and Marketing on YouTube,10382066,R01DA049878,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Award ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavior ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Communication ', ' Freezing ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Peer Review ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Survey Methodology ', ' Survey Method ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Toxicology ', ' Universities ', ' Maternity leave ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Custom ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' base ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Frequencies ', ' Dependence ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' tobacco product use ', ' Tobacco use ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' risk perception ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Modification ', ' pandemic disease ', ' pandemic ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' tobacco advertising ', ' tobacco ads ', ' tobacco marketing ', ' tobacco product advertising ', ' Prevalence ', ' Plug-in ', ' demographics ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' parent grant ', ' public health relevance ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' Electronic cigarette ', ' e-cig ', ' e-cigarette ', ' ecig ', ' ecigarette ', ' vaping ', ' social media ', ' Research Assistant ', ' tobacco regulatory science ', ' electronic cigarette user ', ' e-cig user ', ' e-cigarette user ', ' ecig user ', ' ecigarette user ', ' electronic cigarette use ', ' e-cig use ', ' e-cigarette use ', ' ecig use ', ' ecigarette use ', ' marijuana vaping ', ' cannabis vaping ', ' electronic liquid ', ' e-cig liquids ', ' e-cigarette liquids ', ' e-juice ', ' e-liquid ', ' ecig liquids ', ' ecigarette liquids ', ' ejuice ', ' eliquid ', ' COVID-19 pandemic ', ' COVID crisis ', ' COVID epidemic ', ' COVID pandemic ', ' COVID-19 crisis ', ' COVID-19 epidemic ', ' COVID-19 global health crisis ', ' COVID-19 global pandemic ', ' COVID-19 health crisis ', ' COVID-19 public health crisis ', ' COVID19 crisis ', ' COVID19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 global health crisis ', ' COVID19 global pandemic ', ' COVID19 health crisis ', ' COVID19 pandemic ', ' COVID19 public health crisis ', ' SARS-CoV-2 epidemic ', ' SARS-CoV-2 global health crisis ', ' SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic ', ' SARS-CoV-2 pandemic ', ' SARS-CoV2 epidemic ', ' SARS-CoV2 pandemic ', ' SARS-coronavirus-2 epidemic ', ' SARS-coronavirus-2 pandemic ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 epidemic ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 pandemic ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 epidemic ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 crisis ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 global health crisis ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 global pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 health crisis ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 public health crisis ', ' coronavirus disease crisis ', ' coronavirus disease epidemic ', ' coronavirus disease pandemic ', ' severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 global health crisis ', ' severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 global pandemic ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' ']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,73027,CT-03
"From Manic Symptoms to Bipolar Disorder: Neural-behavioral Markers Using Two Analytic Models PROJECT SUMMARY Bipolar disorder (BD) is a devastating neuropsychiatric illness that affects 2-5% of youth and causes morbidity, functional impairment, and suicide. Prodromal manic symptoms without manic episodes usually emerge before BD types I and II (BD-I/II) develop, but less than 60% of youth with manic symptoms will develop BD-I/II. The uncertainty of diagnosis and illness progression results in potentially detrimental interventions and 7-10 years delay appropriate treatments. It is thus imperative that objective biomarkers of risk for conversion to BD-I/II are identified and tested in youth before the peak onset of illness. Given that neural measures of structure and function associated with emotion and reward processing, in combination with clinical and behavior measures, can improve prediction of psychiatric outcomes in youth, this project will investigate brain-behavior relations in the most severely ill youth during inpatient stays and aims to build a predictive model of BD. We aim to use two distinct analytic models to test our hypotheses. First a general linear model (GLM) with a machine learning (ML) model of regularized regression with cross validation and second a whole brain ML pattern recognition model. We will first identify neural and behavioral markers of BD-I/II in circuitry associated with emotion and reward processing. We hypothesize that decreased activity and connectivity in prefrontal, amygdala, and striatal regions and behavioral measures showing less sleep, lower activity, and poorer mood and cognition will distinguish BD- I/II from clinically matched youth without mania and healthy. Next, we will identify using ML a whole brain neural classifier of BD-I/II relative to clinically matched inpatients without mania. Aim 2 is to, after two years, identify and quantify the neural and behavioral measures that predict conversion to BD-I/II, and to test individual conversion in an independent group of high symptomatic risk adolescents. Aim 3 is to identify brain-behavior associations for app development. Training samples include mid-/post- pubertal adolescents aged 13-17 years recruited from the nation’s only specialized inpatient unit for adolescents with BD and the general adolescent unit at our hospital; 70 well-characterized adolescents with BD-I/II, a clinically matched group of 70 inpatient youth without mania. Testing sample is an independent group of 180 adolescents with manic symptoms without BD-I/II. 60 healthy controls will be recruited. The project includes emotion and reward processing neural function and structure, clinical and behavioral measures including sleep and activity with actigraphy, computerized cognitive measures, and self-reports during inpatient evaluation and for two weeks post discharge. At two-year follow up, clinical assessments will confirm diagnoses. This is the first study to employ a multimodal assessment of behavior and mood symptoms combined with multimodal imaging methods to comprehensively assess disease-specific abnormalities and prediction of BD-I/II. Findings from this study may identify biological and behavioral markers of conversion to BD-I/II in adolescents and may contribute developing disease-specific risk calculators, low-cost biosensors for mobile applications, and novel targets of intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adolescents may experience manic symptoms that may or may not progress into bipolar disorder. This proposed longitudinal study would be the first of its kind and could shed light on the neural and behavioral markers of disease progression in high-risk adolescents with manic symptoms. Identifying such markers for bipolar disorder has important clinical implications such as improving early detection of illness and informing treatment planning and personalized interventions.",From Manic Symptoms to Bipolar Disorder: Neural-behavioral Markers Using Two Analytic Models,10116487,R01MH121451,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Behavior ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cognition ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emotions ', ' Future ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Linear Models ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Matched Group ', ' Moods ', ' Morbidity -

"Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data ABSTRACT This Independent Scientist Award will significantly enhance my research capabilities, enabling me to become a leading quantitative investigator in the field of substance use disorders (SUDs). Specifically, it will allow me to increase my knowledge in the areas of SUD phenotypes, treatment and genetics. SUDs are clinically and etiologically heterogeneous and their classification has been difficult. This application reflects my ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of SUDs through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data. My extensive training in computational science and prior research on biomedical informatics have provided me with the skills to design, implement and evaluate advanced algorithms and sophisticated analyses to solve challenging problems in classifying SUDs. My ongoing NIDA-funded R01 employs a large (n=~12,000) sample aggregated from multiple genetic studies of cocaine, opioid, and alcohol dependence to develop and evaluate novel statistical models to generate clinical SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. This K02 proposal extends that work to evaluate treatment outcome in refined subgroups of SUD populations using data from treatment studies for cocaine, opioid, alcohol and multiple substance dependence. This project will integrate data from diagnostic behavioral variables and genotypes, as well as biological/neurobiological features of the disorders and repeated measures of treatment outcome. The primary career development goals of this application are to: (1) understand the reliability, validity and functional mechanisms of various phenotyping methods; (2) to continue training in the genetics of addictions; and (3) to gain greater knowledge of different treatment approaches and their efficacy. A solid foundation in these areas will enhance my ability to realize the full potential of the data collected and aggregated from multiple dimensions, and to use the data to design the most clinically useful analysis and generate innovative solutions to diagnostic and predictive challenges in SUD research. Through formal coursework, directed readings, individual tutoring and intensive multidisciplinary collaboration with a diverse team of world-renowned researchers, I will receive training and collect pilot data for future R01 projects by examining (Aim I): whether clinically-defined highly heritable subtypes derived in my current R01 project predict differential treatment response; (Aim II) whether new statistical models that directly combine treatment data with behavioral, biological, and genomic data identify refined subtypes with confirmatory multilevel evidence; and (Aim III) whether there are genetic and social moderators of treatment outcome by subtype. The overall goal of this proposal is to further my independent and multidisciplinary research program in the development of statistical methods for refined classification of SUDs. The K02 award will provide me with the protected time necessary to fully engage in the training activities described that will enhance my knowledge and skills to enable me to make important, novel contributions to the genetics and treatment of SUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop novel statistical and quantitative tools to identify homogeneous subtypes of substance use disorders (SUDs) and other complex diseases to enhance gene finding and treatment matching. The proposed project will perform secondary analyses of existing data from treatment studies of cocaine, opioid, alcohol, and mixed SUDs. The proposed novel approaches are expected to advance precision medicine approaches to SUDs by enabling treatment matching and a more refined SUD classification to gene finding.",Classifying

"Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network Project Summary/Abstract  This proposal is a competing renewal application of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN), which joined the CTN in 2015. The Northeast Node brought hundreds of community and healthcare partners across the states of New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine to the CTN community for the first time. These states have among the very highest rates of substance use in the U.S., including opioid use, and they include some of the most rural communities in the U.S. The Node has brought significant expertise to the CTN in conducting practical, rigorous, innovative, and highly impactful trials focused on improving the treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs) in community systems in the Northeast and in partnership with other CTN Nodes across the nation. Node Investigators have extensive experience in leading national and multi-national clinical trials, digital technology; medication and behavioral treatments for opioid use disorder; co-occurring SUDs and mental health disorders; SUD and chronic pain; SUD in pregnant women; opioid, cannabis, tobacco, alcohol, stimulant, and polydrug treatment; SUD prevention and treatment among youth; and implementation science. The Northeast Node is embedded within the Center for Technology and Behavioral Health (CTBH), a NIDA-funded P30 “Center of Excellence”. The Node thus brings significant expertise in developing, evaluating, and implementing digital treatments for SUDs, with a focus on overcoming the striking disparities in treatment access and treatment quality evident in healthcare across the globe.  In the renewal period, the Node proposes to enhance its activities and contributions to the national CTN to embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for SUDs. The Node will engage a broader group of investigators that bring additional expertise in data science (bioinformatics, predictive modeling, artificial intelligence, social media, data privacy/security) and experimental design (micro-randomized trials, adaptive designs, and implementation/systems science). With this expanded group of partners, it will support and grow a productive research agenda in the CTN with a focus on (a) digital health and data analytics, including research focused on providing personalized, science-based resources to individuals with SUD via digital technology and (b) expanding low threshold access to science-based SUD care, particularly in rural contexts (e.g., general medical settings; pharmacies; and community organizations). And the Node will lead an expansion of CTN research on the (c) rapidly evolving landscape of cannabis use as well as (d) co-morbid SUD and mental health disorders. The Node will establish Community and Policy Advisory Boards to complement the existing communication infrastructure between Node investigators and their partners, with a focus on identifying the most significant and timely SUD needs in our communities and scaling-up and sustaining best practices. Project Narrative The proposed activities of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for substance use disorders (SUD). These activities reflect a vision for the next iteration of the CTN in the next 5 years. This work will advance translational science in SUD research and markedly reduce the gap between SUD research and clinical practice -- with a focus on scaling-up and sustaining best

"Using Machine Learning Approaches to Examine Emotion-Related Brain Activity and Substance Use Among Adolescents Project Summary/Abstract  Substance use and substance use disorder are leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Importantly, most adults with substance use disorder begin using substances as adolescents, making adolescence an important period for the development of substance use disorder. Thus, it is critical to identify factors related to substance use among adolescents, consistent with NIDA objective 1.1. One factor linked to adolescent substance use is negative emotion processing. As adolescents undergo significant biological and psychosocial changes across development they may experience altered negative emotion processing that can lead to substance use if not appropriately regulated. Unfortunately, there is limited understanding in how neural level differences in negative emotion processing is related to substance use among adolescents. Moreover, extant neuroimaging research on negative emotion processing and substance use has employed univariate methods instead of multivariate methods. In contrast to univariate methods, multivariate methods are more sensitive in detecting patterns of neural activation across voxels and yield more generalizable and replicable findings overall. In addition, this research has employed standardized negative emotion paradigms, which have high experimental control, but may be less likely to reflect negative emotion processing as it occurs in the real world. To address these gaps in the literature, the proposed study will use multivariate machine learning approaches (i.e., multivoxel pattern analysis) to classify patterns of neural activation in a standardized negative emotion processing task and in a novel naturalistic negative emotion processing task that differentiate substance using adolescents from non-using adolescents, as well as predict substance use disorder risk factors. Additionally, the proposed study will use machine learning approaches to examine sex differences in emotion-related neural activation to these tasks in relation to substance use. This research will be conducted on a sample of 326 12-13 year old adolescents from Sponsor’s (Chaplin) competing renewal grant (RO1 DA033431-06A1). Knowledge from the proposed study will be used to identify emotion-related neurobiological markers of adolescent substance use. Ultimately, these markers can be used to target at-risk adolescents in need of substance use prevention and intervention efforts. The goals of the proposed study will be accomplished within a research training plan aimed at developing multidisciplinary expertise in affective neuroscience, particularly in multivariate machine learning methods, and developmental models of substance use. The training plan includes completion of relevant coursework, attendance at targeted workshops, individual mentorship by experts in the field of development and neuroscience, and scientific writing and presentation experience. Project Narrative  This project uses machine learning fMRI approaches to investigate patterns of neural activation during negative emotion processing to classify and predict adolescent substance use. The goal of this research is to identify emotion-related neurobiological markers of substance use.

"Neural sensitivity to social evaluation and daily online and in-person social experience with peers: Predicting fluctuations in suicidality, self-harm, and depressive symptoms in adolescent girls PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Rates of suicide, self-harm, and depression are alarmingly high among adolescent girls, with a dramatic spike over the last decade, yet it is not clear which girls are at highest risk for these serious problems and when they might escalate. Some have argued that the dramatic rise in social media (SM) use may play a role, but more rigorous data are needed to evaluate the positive and negative effects of SM use in adolescent girls. Sensitivity to social evaluation, such as rejection or exclusion, is a potential cross-diagnostic risk factor for self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITB; including suicidal ideation and behavior and nonsuicidal self-injury) and de- pressive symptoms (DEPsx). This study examines how socially threatening and rewarding peer interactions— experienced online or in-person—contribute to real-time fluctuations in SITB, DEPsx, and well-being. The first aim is to use ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to identify how adolescent girls’ daily subjective experi- ence of online and in-person social threat and reward predict proximal within-person changes and longer-term between-person differences in SITB and DEPsx, along with wellbeing. The sample will include 177 adolescent girls (ages 13-17), with 75% of the sample at high-risk for suicide (e.g. active ideation within past 6 weeks, at- tempt in past year, or ≥ five episodes of nonsuicidal self-injury in past year), with at least half of high-risk par- ticipants also reporting elevated DEPsx. Girls will complete three 10-day bursts of EMA and will also provide access to passively obtained data on SM use and digital social interactions (i.e. text, video-chat). Multilevel modeling analyses will be used to identify predictors of near-term changes in SITB, DEPsx, and positive affect (PA), as well as long-term outcomes assessed at 6- and 12-month follow-up. A second aim is to identify which girls are at highest risk for DEPsx and/or SITB when exposed to near-term precipitants, focusing on differences in brain activation to social evaluation within an affective salience network (ASN) that includes the amygdala, anterior insula, dorsal and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, and nucleus accumbens. Building on the differ- ential susceptibility to context theory, the study proposes that heightened ASN activation to social evaluation is a susceptibility factor that could amplify both the positive and negative effects of daily social experience on SITB and DEPsx. Girls will complete neuroimaging tasks that assess brain response to social evaluation from virtual peers. It is hypothesized that within-person increases and higher rates of peer social threat experiences (online and in-person) will be most strongly associated with SITB and DEPsx for girls with heightened ASN activation to social evaluation, and that within-person increases and higher rates of peer social reward experi- ences will also be more strongly associated with PA/wellbeing and more protective against SITB and DEPsx for girls with heightened ASN activation to social evaluation. Finally, machine learning will be used to determine which objective features of SM use track in real-time with subjective experience and emotional health, and to identify the strongest set of predictors of short-term and long-term emotional health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Results from this study could help address the current mental health crisis among adolescent girls by leverag- ing real-time data to identify near-term risk factors that more optimally predict when girls will experience esca- lations in suicidality, as well as common earlier precursors to suicide such as nonsuicidal self-injury and de- pressive symptoms, and leveraging neuroimaging data to identify which girls may be at highest risk. This infor- mation is critical for improving real-time risk detection, designing just-in-time suicide prevention and inter- vention approaches, and accelerating the discovery of potential neural markers of risk and/or protection from these serious emotional health problems. Additionally, the study will provide rigorous empirical data on the real-time positive and negative links between social media use and adolescent emotional health that can inform public perceptions and policies surrounding social media use among adolescents.","Neural sensitivity to social evaluation and daily online and in-person social experience with peers: Predicting fluctuations in suicidality, self-harm, and depressive symptoms in adolescent girls",10298070,R01MH124866,"['Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Buffers ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Persons ', ' Nucleus Accumbens ', ' Perception ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Play ', ' Puberty ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Self-Injurious Behavior ', ' Deliberate Self-Harm ', ' deliberate self harm ', ' intentional self harm ', ' intentional self injury ', ' self harm ', ' self injury ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' improved ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Anterior ', ' Dorsal ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Policies ', ' Published Comment ', ' Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Exposure to ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Frequencies ', ' Techniques ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' experience ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Exclusion ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' multi-level model ', ' multilevel model ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' girls ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' ward ', ' Address ', ' video chat ', ' video conferencing ', ' Videoconferencing ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Collection ', ' Risk Marker ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Depression and Suicide ', ' depression and suicidality ', ' Text ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' tv watching ', ' screen time ', ' television watching ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' virtual ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' Population ', ' Affective ', ' high risk ', ' non-suicidal self injury ', ' nonsuicidal self injury ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' social media ', ' Text Messaging ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,837750,PA-18
"Leveraging Social Media for Substance Use Behavioral Insight  Project Summary Substance misuse places a tremendous burden on individuals and society and remains high because so many youth initiate substance use at an early age and progress to dependence. In one of my NIDA sponsored R01s, I am funded to examine the effects of school and state-level penalties on youth substance use behaviors while accounting for anti-tobacco/drug media campaigns (R01 DA032843). My research signals a health issue of increasing importance that is youth exposure to the promotion of alcohol, tobacco, and other drug-related content via advertisements, online social networking, and other normalizing and pro-use messages. There is potential for leveraging social media as a tool to understand, inform, and potentially dissuade harmful substance use behaviors. However, a critical and necessary first step is to better understand displayed substance use references on key social media sites and how these displays are associated with use. In my second NIDA-sponsored R01, I am funded to investigate the implications of social media content and engagement for alcohol and marijuana use (R01 DA039456). I am a newly tenured investigator who has already made important contributions to the study of substance use policy and social media research. I will investigate social media posts for novel insight into drug use, especially newly emerging drugs that are increasing in popularity. I also aim to generate a strong scientific base about social media as a potential medium for delivering anti-/pro- substance use messages to young people. At this juncture, it is critical for me to receive support from this Independent Scientist Award so that I can devote all of my efforts towards continuing to build my research program and to enhance my scientific skills and advance me to the next level of achievement. I will collaborate with investigators at Washington University and nationally in order to gain further experience in sophisticated and efficient data mining analysis. I will additionally achieve an improved ability to synthesize results across multiple studies into strategic and actionable recommendations for tailored prevention messages to deliver on social media. This award will also enable me to devote a substantial amount of time to mentorship and the development of the next generation of researchers. In summary, this Independent Scientist Award will enable me to expand my knowledge base in targeted areas to significantly enhance my research trajectory in ways that would not be otherwise feasible. Project Narrative This study is significant to the public health field because it will harness social media posts for novel insight into drug use, especially newly emerging drugs that are increasing in popularity. This application requests 5 years of funding to support protected research time for Dr. Cavazos to learn and apply new skills in state-of-the-art “big data” analysis and to synthesize her results

"Identifying specific genetic pathway interactions for drug use and abuse through integrative omics PROJECT SUMMARY  Cannabis use disorders (CUD) are prevalent in the U.S., and highly comorbid with other substance use disorders (SUD) such as alcohol use disorder (AUD), as well as with other mental health problems. While the etiology of cannabis use/misuse have both environmental and genetic components, cannabis use and problematic use are found to be highly heritable. Thus, studies that identify the genetic risk factors for CUD in the general U.S. populations, and in the high-risk populations, are of high public health importance. However, the genetic factors identified in the human genome thus far by conventional methods are sparse and appear to have only captured a very small fraction of the overall heritability for the disorder. One key challenge in addiction genetics is how to identify genetic interactions and epistatic regulations that may play a more important role in determining risk for addictive behaviors than what gene variants do individually, and that may help explain a critical part of the missing link. Genetic interactions have rarely been systematically considered in studies of substance use, primarily due to lack of statistical power and shortage of computational methodology. To address the challenge, we propose a framework to systematically detect disease-relevant context specific genetic pathway interactions that underlie the risk for SUD. The framework will be applied to CUD and comorbid AUD to identify crucial genetic interactions and pleiotropic interactions, filling a critical gap in uncovering the genetic architectures of CUD. We will leverage genetic network and pathway topology and integrate multiple layers of omics including genomics, transcriptomic and epigenomic signals in drug abuse relevant tissues. By sharpening the focus on the functionally connected gene and regulation subsets through a priori analyses, we will be able to dramatically boost the statistical power to detect genetic interactions, arrive at highly biologically relevant and readily interpretable findings, and potentially provide clinically actionable insights. The proposed study will utilize outcomes from large GWAS studies for CUD and AUD, together with three high-risk population cohorts with elevated levels of severe cannabis and alcohol use disorders that have whole genome sequence data. We will complement the context specific pathway-level interaction analysis with high-dimensional variable screening machine-learning algorithms to identify both low and high order genetic interactions and regulatory epistatic effects associated with CUD. The findings that are carefully validated using independent study cohorts will be incorporated into a larger disease model of CUD for prediction and potential intervention, and will open up new avenues of research by allowing interrogation of the addiction genetics from a system’s level. The framework will be build in such a way that is readily transferable to other SUD and mental health studies and sets the stage for a genetically and epigenetically informed, precision medicine approach to SUD prevention and treatment. All software developed in the program will be freely available to the research community. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cannabis use disorders are highly prevalent in the U.S., and frequently co-occur with alcohol and other substance use disorders. The proposed research seeks to identify and determine how key genomic variants and pathways interact with each other in a disease-relevant tissue specific context to affect an individual’s risk for drug abuse.

"Identifying drug and alcohol displays on social media using a machine learning approach, and mechanisms that impact adolescent substance use PROJECT SUMMARY  The overall goal of this application is to support and facilitate the necessary training to develop an independent research career focused on examining online and offline social contexts that influence adolescent substance use (SU). In the long-term, the applicant seeks to develop a program of research focused on the use of digital technologies to examine social risk factors that lead to alcohol and drug use among adolescents and to deliver prevention programming. Through the training goals, guided mentorship, and complementary experiences, the proposed project will strategically advance the applicant's knowledge of social media and SU research. The applicant will also be trained in state-of-the-art quantitative methodologies to enhance the design, conduct, and analysis of big data to improve our current understanding of socialization effects on adolescent SU.  The prevention of alcohol and drug use among adolescents remains a critical area for research, as experimentation with alcohol and drug use can lead to long-term negative consequences. In fact, 9 out of 10 people that experience SU problems began using before the age of 18 (CASAColumbia, 2011). While initiation of SU typically occurs during the teenage years, adolescents are also spending a substantial amount of time using social media. Adolescents use social media as a way to connect with a social network, as well as view and display SU behaviors. However, research evaluating the impact of social media on adolescent SU has been understudied, and the available research has several methodological limitations. Namely, prior work has primarily focused on college samples, as well as a less popular social media platform among adolescents (i.e., Facebook). Furthermore, prior work has used self-report data or human coding to assess online SU content. The proposed study seeks to advance the knowledge regarding the role of social media, specifically exposure to SU content, and user-generated e-cigarette content, in the escalation of alcohol and drug use among adolescents.  The proposed project at the center of this training fellowship includes two aims that propose secondary data analyses, and the collection of original data. Aim 1 of the proposed project (n = 243) will use secondary data analyses to determine whether SU attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control mediate the prospective association between exposure to SU-related content posted by peers and influential figures on offline SU behaviors. Aim 2 of the proposed project (n = 200) will prospectively examine the association between online user-generated e-cigarette content on Instagram and offline e-cigarette use using a novel methodological approach. Machine learning algorithms will be developed to detect e-cigarette content on Instagram profiles, and will be compared to self-report data to assess whether the strength of this association varies based on approach. This project will increase knowledge of adolescent SU behaviors that are not visible offline that could uniquely inform prevention programs by identifying modifiable targets for intervention that are relevant for today's youth. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Adolescent substance use can result in a number of challenges and severe long-term consequences, including academic difficulties, legal problems, the later emergence of a substance use disorder, and injury or death. Social media provides adolescents with opportunities to display and view a variety of substance use behaviors in the absence of negative consequences, and may now represent a key socialization mechanism that has not been widely investigated. The project at the center of this training grant will be the first to assess the influence of exposure to substance use content, by both peers and influential figures, on adolescent substance use, and to identify e-cigarette displays on social media using a machine learning approach.","Identifying drug and alcohol displays on social media using a machine learning approach, and mechanisms that impact adolescent substance use",10314603,F31DA053003,"['Adolescent Behavior ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Fellowship ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Influentials ', ' Judgment ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Marijuana ', ' marihuana ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Perception ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Socialization ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Social Network ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' cigarette use ', ' Fostering ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavior Control ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' experience ', ' college student ', ' university student ', ' high school ', ' novel ', ' Prevention program ', ' peer ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Legal ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' behavior mechanism ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' Data ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' intervention for prevention ', ' prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' preventive intervention ', ' Collection ', ' Teenagers ', ' Teen ', ' teen years ', ' teenage ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' adolescent substance use ', ' substance use among adolescents ', ' substance use among youth ', ' youth substance use ', ' time use ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' willingness ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' prospective ', ' drinking behavior ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' pre-doc ', ' predoc ', ' predoctoral ', ' peer influence ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' deter alcohol use ', ' alcohol use prevention ', ' prevent alcohol use ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' Electronic cigarette ', ' e-cig ', ' e-cigarette ', ' ecig ', ' ecigarette ', ' vaping ', ' social media ', ' electronic cigarette use ', ' e-cig use ', ' e-cigarette use ', ' ecig use ', ' ecigarette use ', ' Facebook ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' ']",NIDA,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,36877,FL-26
"2/2-Neurodevelopmental and Clinical Trajectories of Youth at Risk for Bipolar Disorder ABSTRACT Although bipolar I disorder is a dynamic condition expressing a wide range of affective, cognitive and neurovegetative symptoms, it is defined by the occurrence of mania. Mania typically first emerges in adolescence and young adulthood, and it is a strongly predictive phenotype. Moreover, the early course of bipolar I disorder is progressive, as euthymic periods shorten over time. Additionally, bipolar I disorder is strongly familial with heritability rates approaching 85%. A family history of bipolar I disorder increases risk for mania as well as a number of other psychiatric conditions, including suicidal behaviors and reward hypersensitivity. Together, these characteristics suggest that bipolar I disorder results from an inherited failure during adolescence to develop healthy neural systems that modulate mood and behavioral activation. Complicating the inherited risk is that people with a family history of bipolar disorder also report higher rates of early life adversity than the general population. Early life adversity is associated with lifelong elevated rates of depression, anxiety and substance use disorders, impaired risk-reward processing, and suicide. Consequently, during development individuals with a familial risk for bipolar I disorder may be exposed to a dual risk, i.e. an inherited vulnerability and environmental early-life stress. How these risks interact to impact brain development and subsequent outcomes in these individuals is not known.  Mood and risk-reward behaviors are managed by intersecting ventral prefrontal networks. These networks undergo substantial development in the transition from adolescence to young adulthood (when bipolar I disorder emerges) in which maturation of prefrontal networks leads to adaptive adult emotional regulation and risk-reward processing. Abnormalities in these networks are commonly described in both bipolar disorder and in response to early life adversity, with many shared characteristics. With these considerations in mind, we hypothesize that heritability for bipolar I disorder interacts with early life adversity to synergistically disrupt healthy ventral prefrontal network development during adolescence, underlying a cumulative increased risk for developing mania and other conditions more common in bipolar families. To test this hypothesis, over a four-year interval we will assess trajectories in ventral prefrontal network connectivity in youth at-familial-risk for bipolar I disorder compared to those without this risk, and the interaction with or without early life trauma, to determine whether these risks cumulatively lead to increasing emergence of: 1) mood symptoms and syndromes, 2) substance misuse, 3) suicidal behaviors, and 4) approach motivation hypersensitivity. These results can inform future approaches to prevent illness onset and progression in individuals at risk for or early in the course of bipolar disorder. NARRATIVE Bipolar I disorder typically emerges during adolescence or young adulthood. Using longitudinal study of ventral brain network in youth with or without a familial risk for bipolar I disorder, and with or without childhood maltreatment, we propose to define how brain developmental abnormalities evolve to produce bipolar I disorder.",2/2-Neurodevelopmental and Clinical Trajectories of Youth at Risk for Bipolar Disorder,10181961,R01MH125867,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Globus Pallidus ', ' pallidum ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Allergy ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Maps ', ' Moods ', ' Motivation ', ' Phenotype ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Time ', ' Unipolar Depression ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Family history of ', ' Family Medical History ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Funding ', ' Onset of illness ', ' disease onset ', ' disorder onset ', ' Exposure to ', ' Manias ', ' Manic State ', ' Manic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Hereditary ', ' Inherited ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' austin ', ' Structure ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Reporting ', ' Emotional ', ' response ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' AD/HD ', ' ADHD ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Brain region ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Child Abuse and Neglect ', ' Childhood maltreatment ', ' child maltreatment ', ' Cognitive ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' Outcome ', ' Early-life trauma ', ' Early Trauma ', ' Mind ', ' Heritability ', ' 21 year old ', ' 21 years of age ', ' age 21 ', ' age 21 years ', ' twenty-one year old ', ' twenty-one years of age ', ' Impairment ', ' Affective ', ' reward processing ', ' emotion regulation ', ' emotional regulation ', ' Bipolar I ', ' Bipolar 1 ', ' emotion dysregulation ', ' emotional dysregulation ', ' mood symptom ', ' substance misuse ', ' recruit ', ' early life stress ', ' early life adversity ', ' early adversity ', ' early childhood adversity ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,R01,2021,624675,OH-01
"Positive Valence Systems and Manic Symptom Trajectories in Adolescent Depression PROJECT SUMMARY Depression is a heterogeneous condition with varying degrees of severity and different etiologies that contrib- ute to variability in course trajectory and psychosocial functioning. About a third of adolescents with depression exhibit manic symptoms and as such, this substantially increases the risk for psychosocial impairment and sui- cidality. Yet, few studies have examined the pathophysiology of manic symptoms in adolescent depression and how alterations in key neural systems may be associated with changes in emotional, cognitive, and behavioral functioning. This project will address this important gap by employing a dimensional approach and a longitudi- nal design to examine neural, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral substrates of manic symptoms in (non- bipolar) depressed adolescents. Given evidence that manic symptoms implicate dysregulation of emotion and behavior, the current project will test the overarching hypothesis that alterations in connectivity of fronto- striatal-limbic (FSL) circuitry underlying cognitive control of positive emotion and reward and associated altera- tions in RDoC domain-related (emotional, cognitive, behavioral) measures of functioning in Cognitive and Posi- tive Valence Systems could differentiate depressed adolescents with from those without co-occurring manic symptoms. We aim to test this model in a longitudinal study of 180 mid-/post-pubertal adolescents (12-17 years old), including 140 adolescents with clinically significant depressive symptoms varying in manic symp- toms and 40 age- and sex- matched healthy youth. In accordance with the NIMH RDoC initiative, all depressed adolescents will be recruited from treatment settings based on the presence of clinically significant depression symptoms, irrespective of their categorical depressive disorder diagnosis. The project includes at baseline: a) fMRI paradigms measuring functioning of FSL circuitry associated with cognitive control of positive emotion and reward, b) resting state and diffusion tensor imaging, and c) out-of-the scanner neurocognitive tasks (e.g., approach-avoidance). RDoC domain-related emotional (e.g., elated mood), cognitive (e.g., delay discounting), and behavioral (e.g., impulsivity) functioning and levels of arousal will be assessed using a multi-method ap- proach (e.g., computer tasks in the lab and ecologically-valid web-based mood and actigraphy measures) at baseline and repeated bi-annually over 2 years post-scan. In addition, using machine learning algorithms, ex- ploratory analyses will be performed to identify patterns of baseline neuroimaging data and trajectories of RDoC domain-related (emotional, cognitive, behavioral) measures that can predict levels of mood symptoms and functional impairment at 2 years. Findings from this study could help distinguish subgroups of depressed adolescents based on brain-behavioral relationships, improve early detection of manic symptoms in depressed youth, and inform personalized interventions (e.g., antidepressant vs. mood-stabilizer, type of psychotherapy). PROJECT NARRATIVE Early identification of manic symptoms (e.g., impulsive and risk taking behavior, mood lability) and its trajectories can decrease the huge and chronic burden of depressive disorders on youth, families, and society. This pro- posed longitudinal study has the potential to identify neural and behavioral markers of manic symptoms in de- pressed adolescents (without bipolar disorder). Identifying such markers has important clinical implications such as improving early detection of manic symptoms in depressed youth and informing personalized interventions for depression with mixed features (e.g., antidepressant versus mood-stabilizer or tailoring psychotherapeutic ap- proaches).  ",Positive Valence Systems and Manic Symptom Trajectories in Adolescent

"Identifying Person-Specific Drivers of Adolescent Depression via Idiographic Network Modeling of Active and Passive Smartphone Data PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Adolescents experience escalating risk for developing clinical depression, which can lead to lifelong morbidity and mortality. The neural, physical, cognitive, and socioemotional changes that may contribute to this risk also signal an opportunity for high impact intervention. Unfortunately, psychotherapy trials demonstrate modest effects on youth depression. To improve long-term outcomes for adolescents, this study will identify person- specific drivers of adolescent depression that can guide treatment personalization. Prior research with depressed or anxious adults demonstrates the existence of such drivers—symptoms and related processes that are influential (i.e., predict change in other symptoms), modifiable, and exhibit individual differences. Personalized selection and sequencing of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) modules to target these drivers early in adults have produced larger treatment effects compared to a historical benchmark. Identifying person- specific drivers during adolescence could inform treatments that account for both developmental and individual differences to shift the trajectory of depression onset and maintenance. Investigating person-specific drivers usually involves intensive surveying of self-reported experience via smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Emerging evidence suggests that smartphones can also monitor mood through passive sensing of depression-related behaviors with minimal response burden. However, nearly all such studies have been conducted with adults, despite near universal smartphone ownership among adolescents in the US. Thus, this study will leverage depressed adolescents' everyday smartphone use to assess the validity of mobile sensing against established ambulatory methods (i.e., EMA and actigraphy) to identify person-specific drivers of adolescent depression. Fifty adolescents (12–18 years old) with elevated depressive symptoms will participate in 30 days of: a) smartphone-based EMA of depressive symptoms, processes, and affect (4x/day), sleep diary (1x/day); (b) mobile sensing of mobility, physical activity, sleep, natural language use in typed interpersonal communication, screen-on time and call frequency/duration; and (c) wrist actigraphy of physical activity and sleep. Adolescents and caregivers will complete diagnostic interviews and other measures (e.g., developmental, clinical, Research Domain Criteria) at baseline, as well as user feedback interviews at follow- up. To address study aims: 1) idiographic, within-subject networks of EMA symptoms will be modeled to identify each adolescent's drivers; 2) correlations among EMA, mobile sensor, and actigraph measures of sleep, physical, and social activity; and machine learning prediction of core depressive symptoms (self- reported mood and anhedonia) will be used to assess the validity of mobile sensing for identifying person- specific drivers; 3) between-subject baseline characteristics will be explored as predictors of person-specific drivers. These results will inform future development of a scalable, low-burden smartphone-based tool that can guide personalized treatment decisions for depressed adolescents, with potential public health impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adolescence is marked by escalating risk for developing clinical depression, but also presents an optimal window for high impact intervention to alter the course of this often disabling disorder. To inform future efforts to personalize psychological interventions for depressed adolescents and maximize their efficacy, the proposed study will identify person-specific drivers of adolescent depression—influential and modifiable symptoms and processes that exhibit individual differences—and demonstrate the validity of using a smartphone tool to identify these person-specific drivers.

"Integrating primate-rodent cell types and epigenomics to identify conservation in substance addiction Project Summary/Abstract Substance use disorders (SUD) of many highly addictive drugs affect more than 100 million people worldwide. Genetic variations associated with complex neuro-behavioral traits, such as drug addiction, are likely to impact enhancers which have a high degree of cell type-specificity and can be conserved across species. Furthermore, variation in addiction behavior has been linked to genetic variation in both human and rodents. Thus, it follows that genetic mechanisms driving addiction behavior, specifically at cell type-specific enhancers, might also be conserved between primates and rodents. I hypothesize that risk variants for some SUDs may lie in enhancers of distinct cell types in the reward areas and not others, providing insight into the cell types that are critical to SUDs. This project proposes to identify the gene markers and putative enhancers of cell types that are conserved or clade-specific to primates and rodents and of these, which are enriched for SUD human genetic risk variants. The proposal comprises of the following aims: Aim 1: identify the primate-rodent conserved cell types and marker gene profiles enriched for human SUD risk variants. Aim 2: identify the primate-rodent conserved putative enhancer profiles to test whether mouse substance use behavior risk loci disrupt similar putative conserved enhancers to human SUD risk loci. Together, these experiments could reveal primate-rodent gene and enhancer atlas of conserved and species-specific cell types of the reward system by integrating single-nuclei genomics data across multiple mammalian species. This information is critically important because better understanding of how an individual’s genetic makeup could affect the cells of the reward circuit will inform future work to craft personalized, targeted SUD therapy. Thus, this work integrates closely with my clinical interests in addiction medicine. This proposal outlines a combination of rigorous mentored research training, longitudinal clinical experiences, coursework, and professional and leadership development activities. The intellectual, technical, and professional skills refined during this fellowship training period will be instrumental in my development as an aspiring physician scientist in the clinical field of addiction medicine.

"Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network Project Summary/Abstract  This proposal is a competing renewal application of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN), which joined the CTN in 2015. The Northeast Node brought hundreds of community and healthcare partners across the states of New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine to the CTN community for the first time. These states have among the very highest rates of substance use in the U.S., including opioid use, and they include some of the most rural communities in the U.S. The Node has brought significant expertise to the CTN in conducting practical, rigorous, innovative, and highly impactful trials focused on improving the treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs) in community systems in the Northeast and in partnership with other CTN Nodes across the nation. Node Investigators have extensive experience in leading national and multi-national clinical trials, digital technology; medication and behavioral treatments for opioid use disorder; co-occurring SUDs and mental health disorders; SUD and chronic pain; SUD in pregnant women; opioid, cannabis, tobacco, alcohol, stimulant, and polydrug treatment; SUD prevention and treatment among youth; and implementation science. The Northeast Node is embedded within the Center for Technology and Behavioral Health (CTBH), a NIDA-funded P30 “Center of Excellence”. The Node thus brings significant expertise in developing, evaluating, and implementing digital treatments for SUDs, with a focus on overcoming the striking disparities in treatment access and treatment quality evident in healthcare across the globe.  In the renewal period, the Node proposes to enhance its activities and contributions to the national CTN to embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for SUDs. The Node will engage a broader group of investigators that bring additional expertise in data science (bioinformatics, predictive modeling, artificial intelligence, social media, data privacy/security) and experimental design (micro-randomized trials, adaptive designs, and implementation/systems science). With this expanded group of partners, it will support and grow a productive research agenda in the CTN with a focus on (a) digital health and data analytics, including research focused on providing personalized, science-based resources to individuals with SUD via digital technology and (b) expanding low threshold access to science-based SUD care, particularly in rural contexts (e.g., general medical settings; pharmacies; and community organizations). And the Node will lead an expansion of CTN research on the (c) rapidly evolving landscape of cannabis use as well as (d) co-morbid SUD and mental health disorders. The Node will establish Community and Policy Advisory Boards to complement the existing communication infrastructure between Node investigators and their partners, with a focus on identifying the most significant and timely SUD needs in our communities and scaling-up and sustaining best practices. Project Narrative The proposed activities of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for substance use disorders (SUD). These activities reflect a vision for the next iteration of the CTN in the next 5 years. This work will advance translational science in SUD research and markedly reduce the gap between SUD research and clinical practice -- with a focus on scaling-up and sustaining best

"Prototype for an online skills-based drug prevention program targeting youth 11-13 PROJECT ABSTRACT Drug prevention programs that migrate to the web are interactive, but mostly fail to engage youth and maximize program exposure. An alternative approach considers gamification with animated sequences and uses machine learning algorithms based on Markov Decision Processes to stimulate youths’ curiosity, engage them in a real-world scenario that requires real-time strategic thinking. In this Phase I SBIR, we propose to design, build, and test an alpha prototype for Skills-Based Learning (SBL) Online, a fully gamified drug abuse prevention program. Gamification studies now conclusively show that youth can and do learn from playing videogames, particularly when they feel immersed in the game, maintain high levels of curiosity, and form a social identity or close attachment to the characters in the game. Programs also stimulate learning when they provide scaffolding, using guiding, coaching, and modeling that help youth master skills and advance to new challenge levels. In addition, the game has to be responsive to the player, incorporate their in- game behavior, and tailor play to their skill levels as opposed to delivering a prefixed program. When these elements of a videogame come together, they have been shown to stimulate higher order thinking and problem-solving skills that have value in the real-world. We propose to blend instructional design principles with state-of-the-art gamification using machine learning algorithms to create a realistic animated game that teaches decision-making, problem-solving, and social skills. The game involves animation, brief video vignettes, non-playing characters, and a personalized pedagogical agent (an avatar) to guide youth through a simulated environment that presents them with realistic social interactional challenges. The program targets youth in early adolescence (ages 11 to 13), a period when they face numerous developmental challenges that when successfully negotiated helps them crystallize an identity. Shifting tides of influence from parents to peers, seeking emotional independence and greater autonomy plus the adoption of formal operational reasoning are a few of the many factors that fuel “storm and stress” during adolescence. This Phase I application will coalesce the strengths of prevention and computer scientists to build and test an alpha prototype of SBL Online. The study combines formative evaluation using focus groups to learn more about the nature of youths’ social interactions, the settings in which they encounter peer pressure, their perceptions of risky behavior, future orientation, and problem-solving skills they employ to offset life’s pressures. Usability testing iteratively covers early and later build phases, plus active playtesting using think-aloud techniques. A second thrust involves obtaining input from key stakeholders (middle school teachers, youth service providers) to ascertain the program’s developmental and cultural appropriateness and commercial potential. The technology partner (3C) has an extensive acumen building and commercializing social emotional learning- based health-related applications for children and youth including projects with the investigators. NARRATIVE  Adolescent drug use, including the consumption of alcohol, cigarettes and marijuana, remain significant health and social problems that require the development of effective preventive strategies. This research advances game-based learning with an online drug prevention program that can be delivered alone or in conjunction with other classroom-based instructional strategies. Moreover, this intervention combines emerging instructional design and learning theories in combination with evidence-based prevention science to create a fun, engaging, and immersive

"Social Media Use and Mechanisms of Suicide Risk in Adolescents Project Summary/Abstract Suicide rates have nearly doubled among adolescent girls over the past decade. During this same time period, social media sites (e.g., Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook) have become ubiquitous, with nearly 97% of youth now using social media. Social media offers both risks and benefits for adolescent development. However, there is likely a vulnerable subset of youth for whom social media use influences suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs). The primary goal of this study is to examine how and for whom social media use contributes risk for STBs, so that we may better identify and intervene with youth most at risk. A multi-method approach, integrating computational psychiatry and experimental techniques, will be used to investigate the specific mechanisms by which social media use affects STBs. Data will be collected from both an existing dataset (n ~ 2,000) and a recruited sample (n = 90 adolescent females, ages 14-17, with lifetime history of STBs). To identify specific, directly observable social media experiences that heighten risk for STBs, digital trace data (i.e., social media content and meta-data) will be collected directly from adolescents’ social media pages and analyzed using machine learning techniques. In addition, an innovative laboratory paradigm with eye- tracking/pupillometry will be used to examine cognitive and affective responses to social media use that increase vulnerability to STBs. Participant STBs will be assessed at baseline, 3-month-, and 6-month follow ups. The aims of the study are well-aligned with the candidate’s long-term career goal of becoming an independent investigator of adolescent social media use and mental health. To purse this research agenda going forward, the candidate proposes training in four key areas: (1) machine learning methods for analyzing digital trace data, (2) experimental eye tracking/pupillometry paradigms, (3) mechanism-based translational research in adolescent suicide risk, and (4) professional development, with an emphasis on training in effective interdisciplinary collaboration and the ethics of social media research. A team of mentors and consultants from multiple disciplines will facilitate the candidate’s training, including experts in youth suicide risk, machine learning and natural language processing, and experimental peer interaction paradigms. The diverse resources available at Brown University and Rhode Island Hospital will ensure successful completion of the project and foster the development of the candidate’s research program. The proposed study has the potential to contribute significantly to our understanding of the role of social media in adolescent suicide risk. Completion of the proposed research and training goals will uniquely position the candidate to become a leader in the field of adolescent social media use. Project Narrative Nearly all adolescents use social media sites, yet for a vulnerable subset of teens, social media use may increase risk for suicide. Given rising suicide rates among adolescent girls in recent years, it is critical to examine the reasons why social media use may be related to suicidal thoughts and attempts. Findings of this study will have the potential to inform future suicide intervention and prevention efforts that address the unique needs of adolescents in the digital age.",Social Media Use and Mechanisms of Suicide Risk in Adolescents,10217967,K23MH122669,"['Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Arousal ', ' Attention ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Exhibits ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Feedback ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitals ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rhode Island ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Self Disclosure ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Series ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Ensure ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' social norm ', ' Fostering ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Techniques ', ' gaze ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' experience ', ' eye tracking ', ' visual tracking ', ' transdisciplinary collaboration ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Adolescent Development ', ' career development ', ' girls ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' behavior mechanism ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Cognitive ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Teenagers ', ' Teen ', ' teen years ', ' teenage ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' digital ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Affective ', ' web interface ', ' therapy development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' social media ', ' recruit ', ' adolescent suicide ', ' Facebook ', ' Twitter ', ' learning classifier ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIMH,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,K23,2021,195696,RI-01
"Reducing racial disparities in the treatment of opioid use disorder using machine learning-based causal analysis PROJECT SUMMARY  The opioid overdose crisis emerged in predominantly White communities, but the opioid-related mortality rate is increasing most rapidly in the Black population. A key driver of the crisis is opioid use disorder, which affects over 2 million Americans. Despite their effectiveness, medications for opioid use disorder remain underused, especially among Black Americans. Compared to White Americans, Black Americans have lower access to medications for opioid use disorder, are one-third as likely to initiate treatment, and have lower retention in care. Black Americans face unique structural obstacles to care, such as mistrust of the health care system, lack of representation among medical providers, and racially-biased providers’ perceptions. There is a critical gap in our understanding of the structural factors associated with treatment initiation and retention in care for Black patients with OUD. The scientific objective of this research plan is to identify modifiable structural factors at the community, provider, and facility levels that affect treatment initiation and retention in care for opioid use disorder in the Black population. This innovative project proposes to leverage machine learning-based causal inference methods with a combination of large national electronic medical records, corporate data warehouses, and publicly available data. By combining multiple data sources, this project will empirically evaluate modifiable factors such as provider characteristics (e.g., years of experience, patient satisfaction scores), facility characteristics (e.g., mental health staffing to patient ratios, number of buprenorphine-eligible prescribers), and patient-provider characteristics (e.g., number of previous visits or interactions). While focused on promoting equitable access to treatment for opioid use disorder in Black Americans, the public health implications of this proposal are expected to apply broadly to ameliorate the overall health burden of substance use disorders and reduce health disparities. This research plan is complemented by a career development plan that builds on the applicant’s background in epidemiology and biostatistics. Specifically, this career development plan outlines new training in three areas: (1) the clinical treatment of opioid use disorder, (2) analysis of the massive data of electronic medical records, and (3) machine learning-based causal inference methods. The combined research and training plan will prepare the applicant for a successful independent research career identifying, evaluating, and implementing multilevel interventions to reduce racial/ethnic inequalities in treatment for substance use disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Opioid use disorder is a key driver of the U.S. opioid overdose crisis, yet treatment remains both underused and unequal. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it focuses on identifying modifiable structural predictors of treatment initiation and retention in care for opioid use disorder. The results of this project are expected to inform multilevel interventions equitably deliver treatment for opioid use disorder, ameliorate the overall health burden of substance use disorders, and reduce health disparities.",Reducing racial disparities in the treatment of opioid use disorder using machine learning-based causal analysis,10190881,K99DA051534,"['Affect ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Buprenorphine ', ' Communities ', ' Community Surveys ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Critical Care ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Ethnic People ', ' Ethnic Population ', ' Ethnicity People ', ' Ethnicity Population ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Foundations ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Health Resources ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Minority People ', ' Minority Population ', ' mortality ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Veterans ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' African American ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' forest ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Opioid ', ' Opiates ', ' Development Plans ', ' Inequality ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Therapeutic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Visit ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Characteristics ', ' electronic data ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Population ', ' Natural experiment ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' ethnoracial ', ' standard of care ', ' prescription opioid ', ' licit opioid ', ' opiate medication ', ' opioid medication ', ' prescribed opiate ', ' prescribed opioid ', ' prescription opiate ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' racial disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' opioid use disorder ', ' opiate use disorder ', ' improved outcome ', ' racial bias ', ' race bias ', ' treatment disparity ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' opioid overdose ', ' opiate overdose ', ' opiate related overdose ', ' opioid drug overdose ', ' opioid induced overdose ', ' opioid intoxication ', ' opioid medication overdose ', ' opioid poisoning ', ' opioid related overdose ', ' opioid toxicity ', ' barrier to care ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' data warehouse ', ' multiple data sources ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' Veterans Health Administration ', ' Veterans Health Affairs ', ' substance use treatment ', ' black patient ', ' ']",NIDA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,179582,CA-18
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Data Analysis, Informatics and Resource Center Project Summary/Abstract In its initial funding period, the ABCD consortium used a rigorous epidemiological approach to recruit a diverse sample of 11,878 9-10-year-olds through our 21 research sites, of which 2136 are twins or triplets. ABCD has created a comprehensive yet efficient protocol for participating youth and parents, using standardized and state-of-the-art methods for neuroimaging, biospecimens, and assessments of substance use, mental and physical health, neurocognition, culture, and environment, using a fully digital platform and making use of mobile technologies. We ensure cohesion and standardization by having employed a recruitment strategy designed by a professional survey company (experience with Monitoring the Future); standardized environmental, neurocognitive and mental health assessments, MRI assessments with all scanners using harmonized Human Connectome Project procedures, and computerized data collection with real-time quality control. Developmentally tailored assessments will have stable sensitivity and construct validity across the childhood and adolescent developmental period.

"Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster Care USING ADMINISTRATIVE AND CLINICAL DATA TO DETECT DRUG USE AND HIV RISK IN FOSTER CARE Project Summary  The candidate's goal is to develop an independent research career as a developmental psychologist focused on identifying mechanisms to prevent the onset of pervasive and detrimental health risk behaviors, including substance abuse and HIV risk behaviors, among adolescents and young adults involved in foster care. She has experience in examining psychosocial and behavioral processes during this period of development and a strong publication record for the current phase in her career. Her previous training has emphasized development during adolescence and the transition to adulthood and health behaviors during this timeframe. In the K01, she proposes to expand her training to become an expert leader in team science approaches to address substance use and HIV risk behaviors during adolescence and the transition to adulthood, specifically focusing on foster youth, using child welfare administrative data and electronic medical records (EMR). Her training will emphasize: 1) development as an independent researcher and leader in interdisciplinary approaches to addressing health and development among foster youth, 2) substantive training in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors, and 3) the use of machine learning to distinguish youth at risk, with the end goal of identifying opportunities for prevention. This will be accomplished through seminars and journal clubs offered at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), attending regional and national conferences and trainings on substantive topics, and completion of coursework in child maltreatment and machine learning. Finally, she will complete coursework and seminars addressing the ethical conduct of research. Dr. Beal's goal is to submit an R01, as PI, during the third year of this grant.  CCHMC, one of the top three pediatric research hospitals in the nation, is committed to Dr. Beal's career development. The research environment at CCHMC and within the Division of Behavioral Medicine and Clinical Psychology, and the mentors and collaborators identified in this proposal, are well-suited to Dr. Beal's interests and research goals. Dr. Beal will be co-mentored by Dr. Jennie Noll and Dr. Robert Ammerman. Dr. Noll has extensive experience as a researcher examining the impact of child maltreatment on adolescent development, particularly around sexual risk behaviors. Dr. Ammerman is a well-established researcher with expertise in prevention and intervention programs for high-risk populations. Her advisory committee includes Dr. Melissa Jonson-Reid, an internationally recognized researcher in child welfare and the use of administrative records, Dr. John Schulenberg, developmental psychologist and authority in adolescent and young adult substance use, Dr. Jessica Kahn, expert in adolescent medicine and sexual and HIV risk behaviors, and Dr. John Pestian, leader in machine learning and its application to clinical care. These individuals have made a commitment to mentor and guide Dr. Beal in research and career development.  The objective of this research program is to fill a gap in our current understanding of which adolescents in foster care are at greatest risk for substance use and HIV while simultaneously providing a means for establishing Dr. Beal's independence as a researcher. There are two aims of this proposal. Aim 1 uses discrete time survival analyses and linked child welfare and EMR data to examine the onset and prevalence of substance use and HIV risk behaviors for youth ages 10-20 in foster care compared to matched Medicaid-eligible youth not in foster care (Foster care n=2836; 1-to-1 matched comparison from ~9585 primary care patients). Findings will provide estimates of the rates of substance use and HIV risk behaviors across ages 10-20 and when they increase/decrease, which is critical for identifying the ideal time to begin prevention and intervention efforts. Aim 2 will draw on causal inference techniques and machine learning to identify youth who are substance using or at substantial risk for developing HIV prior to age 21 based on two categories of risk factors: 1 – those common in adolescence, including parental substance use and mental health diagnoses; and 2 – risk factors unique to foster care, including extended time in foster care and placement instability. Analyses will be conducted using structural equation modeling to identify predictors of substance use and HIV risk behaviors. Machine learning will be used to develop classifiers that distinguish youth likely to use substances and contract HIV. This approach will, for the first time, provide a means to identify youth at risk for these negative health outcomes before youth experience these consequences. Via this approach, clinicians and front-line workers will be able to easily distinguish youth at risk and dedicate more time to prevention efforts. The proposed program of training and research will provide a clear pathway for Dr. Beal to transition as an independent researcher. This unique program of research merges her expertise in developmental science and health during adolescence and the transition to adulthood with research in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors to support interdisciplinary, innovative team science approaches to prevent poor health outcomes among foster youth. The proposed studies in this application are significant because the findings take a developmental perspective to provide clinically useful information about which youth are at risk for poor health outcomes. Such an approach is innovative and will transform prevention delivery efforts for vulnerable foster youth. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE) Teens in foster care are at increased risk for substance abuse and contracting HIV compared to their peers, in addition to experiencing poor education, work, and psychosocial outcomes; leveraging administrative child welfare data linked to electronic medical records data for foster youth affords the opportunity to examine key factors that contribute to risk. The goal if this application is to identify youth at risk for substance abuse and HIV, with an eye toward designing intervention and prevention efforts that front-line workers and providers can enact for foster youth prior to age 18 to increase the likelihood that substance abuse and HIV in adulthood can be prevented. The concepts learned through this grant, as well as the career development pursued by the investigator, will be readily applicable to foster youth in child welfare and healthcare settings and could lead to innovations previously unachieved with this challenging and vulnerable adolescent population.",Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster

"Integrating Health Records, Genomic, and Social Data to Stratify Adolescent Depression Risk PROJECT ABSTRACT One in five adolescents in the United States will experience a depressive episode before age 18. Early prevention could offset a lifetime of morbidity including work and social impairment, substance use, and suicidal behavior. A critical step to preventing adolescent depression at a population level is the efficient detection of individuals who could benefit most from targeted intervention. However, known risk factors (e.g., subthreshold symptoms, cognitive styles, interpersonal factors) are often not widely assessed in practice until young people are presenting for psychiatric care, and prospective risk screening tools built in traditional research studies remain poorly implemented at scale in clinical settings where it may not be feasible for providers to routinely collect or integrate additional measures. Large-scale, routine electronic health records (EHRs) from major health systems present a powerful opportunity to overcome these prior limitations but have not yet been harnessed for adolescent depression and often lack environmental and genetic data that may inform etiological understanding and risk stratification. The overall aim of this K08 Career Development Award is to leverage large-scale EHR data with linked genomic and social determinants to enhance the systematic identification of young people at elevated risk of depression in real-world health settings. In this project, the candidate will develop and validate a novel phenotype algorithm for identifying adolescent depression cases from a major healthcare system in the United States containing up to 20 years of longitudinal EHR data for over six million individuals (Aim 1); integrate and comprehensively assess a range of potential social and genomic determinants for EHR-based adolescent depression (Aim 2); and apply modern statistical and machine learning methods to train and evaluate an initial prospective risk stratification model for adolescent depression based on routine EHR data (Aim 3). Improving the phenotyping and stratification of adolescent depression in EHRs will facilitate new avenues of research that will be the basis of subsequent R-level grants that include external validation across health systems, refinement of risk stratification and clinical trajectory models, and brief preventive interventions to enhance resilience in those at risk. Supported by a solid foundation in psychiatric and genetic epidemiology and a multidisciplinary team of world-class experts in an ideal environment, the candidate will acquire new expertise in predictive analytics, biomedical informatics (specifically EHR-exposome-genome integration), adolescent depression and prevention science through intensive mentored research and supervised training and professional development activities. This Award will provide the necessary training for the candidate to develop into a fully independent clinically informed investigator with a translational research program that bridges data science, statistical genetics, and developmental epidemiology to inform actionable strategies for early depression prevention and resilience promotion. PROJECT NARRATIVE Leveraging large-scale, readily available electronic health records data from existing routine workflows represents a powerful, untapped opportunity to enhance prevention through the systematic identification of young people at elevated risk of depression. Even a modest improvement in our ability to prospectively stratify risk of adolescent depression at a health systems level could be useful given its prevalence, the current lack of prospective tools that can be implemented at scale, and low burden of potential preventive strategies.","Integrating Health Records, Genomic, and Social Data to Stratify Adolescent Depression Risk",10284131,K08MH127413,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Award ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' Calibration ', ' Censuses ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Foundations ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Grant ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Learning ', ' Maps ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Morbidity -

"Multi-level statistical classification of substance use disorder ABSTRACT This application represents our ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of substance use disorders (SUDs). This research is achieved through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data that combine clinical symptoms and diagnoses, imaging markers, and genotypes. The team has a PI with expertise in computational science and the development and implementation of innovative statistical algorithms to understand multidimensional data; a PI with extensive experience in systems, imaging and addiction neuroscience; and a co-I who has expertise in the genetics of SUDs. Our previous R01 project employed a sample of ~12,000 individuals aggregated from multiple genetic studies of alcohol and drug dependence to generate SUD subtypes based on clinical symptoms. Because clinical manifestations are distal endpoints in the biological pathway, the genetic effects identified are often weak and inconsistent, and consequently difficult to detect even in large samples. As championed by the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) research, the etiologies of psychiatric disorders, including SUDs, can be fruitfully characterized by dimensional neural features. This project thus extends our ongoing work to include imaging neural features in the classification of SUDs. Specifically, we will utilize a large database from the UK Biobank Project that provides both genetic and multi-modality magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Building on our work with the US Human Connectome Project, we aim in the current project to integrate clinical, imaging, and genotype data to investigate the neurobiological substrates of SUD diagnostic labels, and to derive SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. Methodologically, we replace the classic statistical analysis that is confirmatory and biased to an a priori hypothesis by an approach that emphasizes pattern discoveries from big data. Our specific aims are to: (I): identify neuroimaging features that represent robust markers of addiction and differentiate SUD subtypes that can be confirmed by multi-modality evidence; (II) employ a novel brain connectivity model, on the basis of graph convolutional neural networks, to identify neural markers that precisely characterize the differences in structural changes and functional circuits related to SUDs; and (III) derive an innovative machine learning model to identify highly heritable neurobiological subtypes of SUDs that facilitate investigation of the genetic basis of addiction. We will focus on alcohol and nicotine use disorders to demonstrate the conceptual and methodological approaches. We believe that, by providing a productive conceptual and methodological platform to integrate imaging and genetic data to understand the etiologies of SUDs, this research is highly responsive to the RFA “Leveraging Big Data Science to Elucidate the Neural Mechanisms of Addiction and SUD.” The machine learning tools developed for this project will provide an innovative and reliable foundation to enhance the aggregation and analysis of multidimensional data, and to meet the diagnostic and predictive challenges in mental health research. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will develop novel statistical and quantitative tools to identify and differentiate subtypes of alcohol and nicotine use disorders by combining neural markers, genotype data, and clinical diagnostic information. The proposed analytics will be tested in a large database of alcohol and nicotine use disorders from the UK Biobank project.

"SCH: ChangeGradients: Promoting Adolescent Health Behavior Change with Clinically Integrated Sample-Efficient Policy Gradient Methods Because the majority of adolescent health problems are amenable to behavioral intervention and most adolescents visit a healthcare provider once a year, hea lth behavior change interventions linked to clinic- based health information technologies hold significant promise for improving healthcare quality and subsequent behavioral health outcomes for adolescents. Recognizing the potential to leverage advances in machine learning and virtual narrative environments, the field of health behavior change is now well- positioned to design health behavior change systems that extend the reach of clinicians to realize significant impacts on behavior change for adolescent preventive health. With a focus on risky behaviors and an emphasis on alcohol use, the project has two specific aims: (1) design, develop, and iteratively refine a policy-based reinforcement learning behavior change system for preventive adolescent health, and (2) investigate the impact of a clinically integrated sample-efficient policy gradient-based behavior change system on adolescent behavior. The project w ill culminate w ith an investigation of the behavioral effects of the CHANGEGRADIENTS system using adolescent patients recruited from two outpatient primary care clinics within the UCSF Department of Pediatrics: Mt. Zion Pediatrics and the Adolescent/Young Adult Clinic.

"Telemedicine for Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder PROJECT SUMMARY: A key challenge in combating the opioid epidemic has been connecting individuals with opioid use disorder to evidence-based treatments. The President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis and others have suggested that telemedicine for substance use disorder (“tele- SUD”) may be part of the solution. In preliminary analyses, we have found that tele-SUD use is growing rapidly, and there is widespread policy interest in Congress and state legislatures in how to accelerate this growth. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, signed into law in October 2018, includes several provisions intended to reduce barriers to tele-SUD use and will likely increase the availability of and reimbursement for tele-SUD. However, despite the widespread interest and growing use, there has never been a rigorous assessment of tele-SUD. For example, what are the different tele-SUD models being used to treat opioid use disorder, what barriers exist to greater use of tele-SUD, and is tele-SUD use associated with improved (or potentially worse) quality of care for people with opioid use disorder? To fill this knowledge gap, we propose a comprehensive national evaluation of telemedicine for opioid use disorder using data through 2021 from Medicaid, Medicare, and commercial insurance as well as a series of qualitative interviews. Our Aims are to: (1) describe the different models of how tele-SUD is being incorporated into opioid use disorder care and how this is changing over time, (2) identify regional factors associated with greater tele-SUD use for opioid use disorder, (3) examine the association between tele-SUD use and quality of opioid use disorder care received and whether this varies by model, and (4) describe existing tele-SUD programs, and identify barriers and facilitators to tele-SUD adoption and sustainability. The proposed mixed-methods study will help providers interested in using tele-SUD and inform ongoing debates about regulations and reimbursement for tele-SUD in Congress and state legislatures. Our goal is to highlight policies and practices that drive greater use of tele-SUD and explore its potential role in improving access to, and quality of, care for individuals with opioid use disorder. Our research will help inform how tele- SUD may be leveraged to combat the opioid epidemic as well as other substance use disorders, such as alcohol and methamphetamine use disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Many patients with opioid use disorder have great difficulty accessing substance use disorder (SUD) treatment. Telemedicine for SUD (“tele-SUD”) is one potential solution, and many states and the Congress are considering laws and regulations to encourage greater tele-SUD use. In this project, our goal is to understand how tele-SUD is being used for patients, what drives the variation in use, whether tele-SUD is associated with better care, and how some providers have successfully used tele-SUD.",Telemedicine for Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder,10152467,R01DA048533,"['Adoption ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Buprenorphine ', ' Communities ', ' Congresses ', ' meeting reports ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemic ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' Laws ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methadone ', ' Adanon ', ' Althose ', ' Dolophine ', ' Methadose ', ' Methods ', ' Naltrexone ', ' Nalorex ', ' Nemexin ', ' ReVia ', ' Vivitrol ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' USFDA ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Privacy ', ' physically handicapped ', ' physical disability ', ' physically disabled ', ' Caring ', ' Telemedicine ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' rural location ', ' rural region ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Treatment Period ', ' treatment days ', ' treatment duration ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' American ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Chemical Dependence ', ' Drug Dependence ', ' Drug Dependency ', ' Drug Addiction ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Characteristics ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' combat ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' screening ', ' methamphetamine use ', ' METH use ', ' METH using ', ' methamphetamine using ', ' opioid use disorder ', ' opiate use disorder ', ' improved outcome ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' opiate crisis ', ' opioid crisis ', ' opioid mortality ', ' opiate deaths ', ' opiate mortality ', ' opioid deaths ', ' opioid overdose death ', ' opioid related death ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIDA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2021,913112,MA-07
"Building a Substance Use Data Commons for Public Health Informatics PROJECT SUMMARY Substance misuse comprises a complex set of conditions, often associated with comorbidities and social factors, that are the root cause of misuse and can lead to poor outcomes. Opioid misuse, non-opioid illicit use, and alcohol misuse can also lead to repeated encounters with hospital emergency departments or first-responders. Although substance use disorders are a leading cause of repeat hospital visits, our fragmented data systems do not generate comprehensive information on the scope and character of this poorly treated condition that would allow providers to improve and monitor the quality of care. Crucial social and behavioral determinants strongly linked with substance use (e.g., pre-hospital behavioral events) are not readily available to health systems, but they are important data that can be used to better train artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) models. In principle, hospitals are well-positioned to address these challenges. In practice, these opportunities are frequently missed given the fragmented structure and design of current data systems. Many patients living with substance misuse visit a specific hospital for the first time after an overdose or a related medical condition of drug use such as infection or trauma. Substance use-related conditions are among the top reasons for repeat visits to the hospital. This supplemental will expand on the existing work of the Parent R01, which is focused in clinical informatics, and build an AI/ML-ready public health informatics Substance Use Data Commons and share a novel, all-inclusive prediction model that will help guide clinical interventions and regional health policy. We aim to foster an academic-public-private collaboration to build a data ecosystem in this supplemental grant that will harmonize data across a Wisconsin regional hospital, pre-hospital agencies like fire, and public health agencies for the first time. We will build a cohort with substance misuse with linked data that are engineered as an AI/ML-ready data commons. During our one-year timeline, we will train and test an AI/ML model that can prioritize those at the highest risk for poor outcomes and uncover important biases in our data sources with input by health equity experts. The following goals are to be accomplished from the supplement proposal: (1) build a Substance Misuse Data Commons across a major hospital system and Wisconsin agencies; (2) develop and validate a machine learning tool for substance use-related health outcomes; and (3) examine model performance across health disparate groups (race/ethnic groups as well as neighborhoods). Access to combined data from hospitals, public health agencies, and first responder agencies could provide a comprehensive data resource that would allow us to reliably identify, risk stratify, and prioritize care for some of Wisconsin's most vulnerable residents through AI/ML modeling. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal aims to establish a comprehensive Substance Use Data Commons that combines health system data with public health agency data for a platform designed for machine learning activities to provide health system and public policy leaders guidance on clinical interventions and regional health policy change. We anticipate that the research proposed will surface important biases and lead to novel tools in artificial intelligence that leverage both the electronic health records (EHR) and pre-hospital data from the Wisconsin Department of Health Services and Emergency Medical Services. Ultimately, the tools developed from this proposal will be used to address NIH's special research interest (NOT-OD-21-094) to support collaborations that bring together expertise in biomedicine, data management, and artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) to make NIH-supported data useful and usable for AI/ML analytics",Building a Substance Use Data Commons for Public Health

"Neurobehavioral pathways of polygenic and polyenvironmental effects on the onset and maintenance of substance involvement PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Problematic substance use is associated with significant personal and socioeconomic costs (accounting for approximately 5% of global disease burden and worldwide deaths). Substance use initiation, progression to heavy use, and early onset substance use disorders (SUDs) commonly emerge during adolescence and young adulthood. This developmental period of risk is theorized to result from typical patterns of regionally asynchronous brain maturation (i.e., rapid and early development of limbic regions alongside relatively immature prefrontal and multimodal association cortices) resulting in a diminished ability to suppress inappropriate emotions, desires, and actions when salient environmental cues are present. During later young adulthood the stabilization, reduction, or desistance of heavy use typically occurs alongside maturing cognitive control and emotional regulation abilities coinciding with cortical development. Brain and behavioral maturation may also be influenced by substance use. As genetic and environmental risk factors for substance involvement are predominantly shared across substances, understanding the behavioral and neural mechanisms underlying these shared risk factors in a developmental context will broadly improve our etiologic understanding of substance involvement liability and refine treatment and prevention. In this 5-year R01 (responding to PAR-19- 162), we propose to test whether putative behavioral and neural mechanisms of stage-based addiction may link broad spectrum SUD genomic liability and environmental risk to substance involvement trajectories from childhood – young adulthood using longitudinal data from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (N=11,875 followed from ages 9-16) along with other samples that uniquely extend the temporal scope of ABCD to comprehensively examine brain-behavior developmental interplay related to substance use and misuse (e.g., National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence followed 830 individuals from ages 12-32). Disentangling the behavioral and neural mechanisms underlying broad spectrum genetic and environmental liability to SUD will inform our etiologic understanding of substance use initiation, escalation, and desistence that may ultimately contribute to substance-related policy, education, nosology, prevention, and treatment. Primary deliverables from this project will be manuscripts evaluating whether behavior and neural phenotypes may represent mechanisms underlying polygenic and polyenvironmental risk for substance use disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Substance use often emerges during early adolescence. In some individuals, it progresses to problematic use and use disorder. Liability to develop substance use disorders is shaped by genomic and environmental influences that operate via several mechanisms, including neurobiological pathways associated with behavioral vulnerability. We utilize the ABCD data, along with several other samples that uniquely extend the temporal scope of ABCD to comprehensively examine brain-behavior developmental interplay related to substance use and misuse.",Neurobehavioral pathways of polygenic and polyenvironmental effects on the onset and maintenance of substance involvement,10317570,R01DA054750,"['Accounting ', ' Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Cues ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' indexing ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methods ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Phenotype ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' Siblings ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' Twin Multiple Birth ', ' Twins ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Link ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Withdrawal ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Policies ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Genetic ', ' Attenuated ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' association cortex ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Structure ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' novel ', ' disorder classification ', ' nosology ', ' disease classification ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Intoxication ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' behavior mechanism ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' Data ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' cost ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' early onset substance use ', ' early initiation substance use ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' risk sharing ', ' brain behavior ', ' cognitive control ', ' emotion regulation ', ' emotional regulation ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' early adolescence ', ' emerging adult ', ' early adulthood ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' cognitive development ', ' neural correlate ', ' cognitive reappraisal ', ' cognitive regulation ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' substance misuse ', ' fetal substance exposure ', ' prenatal substance exposure ', ' polygenic risk score ', ' behavioral phenotyping ', ' behavior phenotype ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' ']",NIDA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,393750,MO-01
