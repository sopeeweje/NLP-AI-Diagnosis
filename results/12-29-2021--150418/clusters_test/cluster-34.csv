"Temporal Pattern Perception Mechanisms for Acoustic Communication Project Summary/Abstract: Processing acoustic communication signals is among the most difficult yet vital abilities of the auditory system. These abilities lie at the heart of language and speech processing, and their success or failure has profound impacts on quality of life across the lifespan. Understanding the neurobiological mechanisms that support these basic abilities holds promise for advancing assistive listening devices, and for improving diagnoses and treatments for learning disabilities and communication disorders, such as auditory processing disorder, dyslexia, and specific language impairment. Non-invasive neuroscience techniques in humans reveal the loci of language-related processing but do not answer how individual neurons and neural circuits implement language-relevant computations. Thus, circuit-level neuro-computational mechanisms that support acoustic communication signal processing remain poorly understood. Multiple lines of research suggest that songbirds can provide an excellent model for investigating shared auditory processing abilities relevant to language. This proposal investigates neural mechanisms of auditory temporal pattern processing abilities shared between songbirds and humans. In Aim 1, we test the cellular-level predictions of a powerful modelling framework, called predictive coding, proposed as a general computational mechanism to support the learned recognition of complex temporally patterned signals at multiple timescales. We combine state-of-the-art machine learning methods with multi-electrode electrophysiology, to test explicit models for natural stimulus representation, prediction, and error coding in single cortical neurons and neural populations. One aspect of auditory perception integral to speech is the discretization of the signal into learned categorically perceived sounds (phonemes). In Aim 2, we use the predictive coding framework to investigate the learned categorical perception of natural auditory categories in populations of cortical neurons. In humans, the transition statistics between adjacent phonemes can aid or alter phoneme categorization, providing cues for language learners and listeners to disambiguate perceptually similar sounds. Aim2 also examines how categorical neural representations are affected by temporal context. In addition to which phonemes occur in a sequence, speech processing also requires knowing where those elements occur. Sensitivities to the statistical regularities of speech sequences are established long before infants learn to speak, and continue to affect both recognition and comprehension throughout adulthood. Songbirds also attend to the statistical regularities in their vocal communication signals. In Aim 3, we focus on how sequence-specific information is encoded by single neurons and neural populations in auditory cortex. The proposed approach permits progress in the near term towards establishing the basic neurobiological substrates of foundational language-relevant abilities and a general framework within which more complex, uniquely human processes, can be proposed and eventually tested. Project Narrative: Normal speech comprehension and communication are rooted in basic auditory cognitive processes. Deficits in these processes accompany severe communication disorders (e.g. auditory processing disorder, dyslexia, specific language impairment, autism), and their abnormal function can compound the negative impacts of hearing impairments. The proposed project investigates the neuronal mechanisms of auditory temporal pattern processing using natural communication signals, with the ultimate goal of understanding the neurobiological basis of language-relevant abilities and improving treatment of communication processing disorders.",Temporal Pattern Perception Mechanisms for Acoustic Communication,10160864,R01DC018055,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Auditory area ', ' Auditory Cortex ', ' Auditory Perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' sound perception ', ' Auditory Perceptual Disorders ', ' Acoustic Perceptual Disorder ', ' Auditory Comprehension Disorder ', ' Auditory Perceptual Diseases ', ' Auditory Processing Disorder ', ' Psychoacoustical Disorders ', ' central processing disorder ', ' Behavior ', ' Cognition Disorders ', ' cognitive disease ', ' cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive syndrome ', ' Communication ', ' Communication impairment ', ' Communication Disorders ', ' Communicative Disorders ', ' Cues ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Elements ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Hearing Aids ', ' assistive hearing device ', ' assistive listening device ', ' hearing amplification ', ' hearing assistance ', ' hearing assistive device ', ' hearing device ', ' Heart ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infant ', ' Language ', ' Language Development ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' language acquisition ', ' language learning ', ' Learning ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Perception ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' sound ', ' Speech ', ' Speech Perception ', ' Speech Sound ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Superior temporal gyrus ', ' Comprehension ', ' improved ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Failure ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Starlings ', ' Sturnidae ', ' Sturnus vulgaris ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Auditory ', ' Complex ', ' Parietal ', ' Stream ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' specific language impairment ', ' Word Blindness ', ' Dyslexia ', ' Auditory system ', ' experience ', ' speech recognition ', ' success ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Oscines ', ' song bird ', ' Songbirds ', ' sensory system ', ' Categories ', ' Modality ', ' Learning disability ', ' Learning Disabilities ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' model development ', ' pattern perception ', ' Hearing Loss ', ' Hypoacuses ', ' Hypoacusis ', ' dysfunctional hearing ', ' hearing defect ', ' hearing deficit ', ' hearing difficulty ', ' hearing disability ', ' hearing dysfunction ', ' hearing impairment ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Grouping ', ' groupings ', ' Behavioral ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' Population ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' bird song ', ' birdsong ', ' speech processing ', ' language processing ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' learned behavior ', ' learning behavior ', ' language comprehension ', ' comprehending language ', ' signal processing ', ' cognitive process ', ' sensory input ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' auditory processing ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIDCD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2021,335661,CA-52

"Sound encoding by neural populations in auditory cortex during behavior Project Summary Throughout life, humans and other animals adapt their hearing to perceive features of sound that are important for successful behavioral decisions. Normal-hearing humans are able to detect and discriminate important sounds in crowded noisy scenes and to understand the speech of individuals the first time they meet. However, patients with peripheral hearing loss or central processing disorders often have problems hearing in these challenging settings. Even when they can perceive sounds accurately, the additional listening effort required negatively impacts other cognitive functions. A better understanding of how the healthy auditory system operates in cognitively challenging contexts will support new treatments for these deficits. This project will study how the auditory system represents sound information as it operates in challenging acoustic environments. There are three specific aims. First, high-density microelectrode arrays will be used to record the simultaneous activity of neural populations in auditory cortex during behaviors that require detecting sounds masked by noise or learning new sound-reward associations. Recording from multiple neurons will enable characterizing how information is encoded by the simultaneous activity of neural populations. These experiments will test the hypothesis that population activity in auditory cortex generates representations that are invariant to irrelevant distracting sounds. Second, optogenetic tools will be used to identify distinct neuronal cell types (excitatory versus inhibitory) in cortex. This study will test the hypothesis that tonic activation of inhibitory neurons can explain changes in population activity during behavior. Third, machine learning tools will be used to model the simultaneously recorded neural activity. These experiments will test the hypothesis that neurons in the same local anatomical circuit in auditory cortex encode information about a relatively small domain in the space of all possible auditory stimuli. Models fit to experimental data will also describe how changes in behavioral state shift the way neurons encode sounds and describe sources of correlated population activity that impact neural discriminability during behavior. Together these experiments will establish new links between neural representation of sound and the cognitive processes that extract important information from sound for successful behavior. Project Narrative Patients with hearing impairment and central neurological disorders have difficulty keeping track of speech and other complex sounds, particularly in challenging noisy environments. We seek to understand how populations of neurons in auditory cortex change their activity as the brain adapts to noisy environments. These experiments will provide insight into basic function of the healthy brain that can inform treatment of hearing disorders.",Sound encoding by neural populations in auditory cortex during behavior,10302718,R01DC014950,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Affect ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Arousal ', ' Attention ', ' Auditory area ', ' Auditory Cortex ', ' Auditory Perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' sound perception ', ' Auditory Perceptual Disorders ', ' Acoustic Perceptual Disorder ', ' Auditory Comprehension Disorder ', ' Auditory Perceptual Diseases ', ' Auditory Processing Disorder ', ' Psychoacoustical Disorders ', ' central processing disorder ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Crowding ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Environment ', ' Ferrets ', ' frontal lobe ', ' frontal cortex ', ' Hearing ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Learning ', ' Masks ', ' Methods ', ' Microelectrodes ', ' Miniaturized Electrodes ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Pupil ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' sound ', ' Speech ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Virus ', ' Measures ', ' Enhancers ', ' Mediating ', ' auditory stimulus ', ' density ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Peripheral ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' receptive field ', ' Individual ', ' Hearing problem ', ' Hearing Disorders ', ' auditory disease ', ' auditory disorder ', ' auditory dysfunction ', ' auditory problem ', ' hearing disease ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Auditory ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' Source ', ' cell type ', ' Auditory system ', ' Performance ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Hearing Loss ', ' Hypoacuses ', ' Hypoacusis ', ' dysfunctional hearing ', ' hearing defect ', ' hearing deficit ', ' hearing difficulty ', ' hearing disability ', ' hearing dysfunction ', ' hearing impairment ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Operating System ', ' excitatory neuron ', ' inhibitory neuron ', ' Population ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neural model ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' optogenetics ', ' cognitive process ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' auditory processing ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' normal hearing ', ' good hearing ', ' healthy hearing ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,320591,OR-03
"Motor Modulation of Auditory Processing Project Summary Vocal communication depends on distinguishing our own vocal sounds (vocal feedback) from other sounds. Vocal motor-related corollary discharge (vocal CD) signals that suppress auditory responses to predictable vocal feedback help make this distinction. Notably, vocal CD signals in the human auditory cortex are especially important to speech and their dysfunction is thought to cause auditory hallucinations. Despite the key roles postulated for vocal CD signals, the challenges of monitoring and manipulating their activity in vocalizing animals has prevented systematic analyses. The long-term objective of this application is to understand with synaptic, cellular, and circuit resolution how vocal CD signals modulate auditory cortical responses to vocal feedback, detailed knowledge of which is essential to understand adaptive and maladaptive aspects of audition. We will gain detailed knowledge of synaptic, cellular, and circuit mechanisms underlying this process by studying the mouse, the vertebrate most suited to advanced genetic, electrophysiological, and optical tools. In the prior funding period, we used these tools to advance our understanding the synaptic and circuit mechanisms by which movement-related CD signals modulate auditory cortical activity. These advances included mapping a motor to auditory cortical circuit, determining that various head and body movements activate this pathway to suppress auditory cortical responses to sounds, and showing that this pathway can “learn” to selectively suppress sounds that are predictably yoked to locomotor movements. We also observed auditory cortical suppression in vocalizing male mice, but vocalization occurred during female courtship and was always accompanied by other movements, as well as by social and sexual stimuli. Therefore, whether vocalization-specific CD signals modulate the auditory cortex and suppress predictable vocal feedback remain unknown. Fortunately, we also developed methods for optogenetically gating ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) and for distorting vocal feedback in the isolated, head-fixed mouse. Here we propose to combine these methods with other state of the art techniques, including multi-electrode arrays, in vivo multiphoton imaging, controlled manipulation of vocalization-related auditory feedback, and novel computational methods for voco-acoustic analysis. In the first Aim, we will test the idea that vocalization suppresses auditory cortical activity and use machine learning methods to rigorously quantify and compare spontaneous and optogenetically-evoked USVs. In the second Aim, we will isolate cortical contributions to the vocal modulation of auditory cortical activity. In the third Aim, we will distort vocal feedback to determine if vocal suppression of the auditory cortex is predictive, and use computational methods to systematically quantify vocal distortion. Together, these Aims will provide novel insights into the synaptic, cellular, and circuit mechanisms by which vocal CD signals influence auditory cortical processing. Project Narrative Normal hearing depends on the brain’s ability to anticipate and suppress responses to self-generated vocal sounds, while impaired suppression generates auditory hallucinations. We aim to show how vocal motor signals suppress auditory activity in the brain, thus informing how hearing works in health and disease.",Motor Modulation of Auditory Processing,10121250,R01DC013826,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Animals ', ' Arousal ', ' Auditory area ', ' Auditory Cortex ', ' Behavior ', ' Bone Conduction ', ' bone conduction hearing ', ' bone-conducted hearing ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communication ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Courtship ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Feedback ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Head ', ' Health ', ' Hearing ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Learning ', ' Locomotion ', ' male ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Monkeys ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Production ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' sound ', ' Speech ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' auditory stimulus ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Pyramidal Cells ', ' Auditory Hallucination ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Funding ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Head Movements ', ' Auditory ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' vocalization ', ' Auditory system ', ' auditory feedback ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Ultrasonic ', ' Ultrasonics ', ' Motor ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Optical Methods ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' two-photon ', ' 2-photon ', ' excitatory neuron ', ' inhibitory neuron ', ' Impairment ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' optogenetics ', ' multi-electrode arrays ', ' multielectrode arrays ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' multiphoton imaging ', ' multi-photon imaging ', ' auditory processing ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' autoencoder ', ' autoencoding neural network ', ' deaf ', ' deafened ', ' profound hearing loss ', ' normal hearing ', ' good hearing ', ' healthy hearing ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIDCD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,429899,NC-04
"Behavioral and neural algorithms for decision confidence Project Summary/Abstract The long-term goal of our investigations is to understand how neural circuits in the frontal cortex support decision- making. Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) plays a key role in decision-making under uncertainty and is thought to enable humans and other animals to make predictions about outcomes more accurately. The objective of this proposal is to determine the algorithms responsible for confidence-guided behaviors and their neural basis in the mammalian brain.  Previous work from our laboratory has shown that `decision confidence', a cognitive variable, is encoded in single OFC neurons and OFC inactivation specifically impairs a confidence-guided behavior, time investment. The proposed experiments are designed to determine the computational and neural algorithms responsible for two confidence-guided behaviors: time investment and choice strategy updating (learning). Our central hypothesis is that OFC generates an abstract representation of decision confidence, independent of sensory evidence, that supports multiple confidence-guided behaviors. To test this idea, we have designed a quantitative psychophysical task for rats, adapted from human and primate work, that enable behavioral readouts of confidence, as a post-decision temporal wager. Simply, after each perceptual decision (olfactory or auditory) rats invest time waiting for a delayed, uncertain reward. These graded- duration time investments serve as a behavioral report of confidence that the perceptual decision just made will result in the success of the perceptual decision. First, we will develop computational algorithms to explain confidence-guided time investment and learning, and second we will identify neural substrates of these algorithms in the OFC. Third, we will determine if OFC representations are sensory-modality and behavioral-output general and test the causal role of OFC using inactivations. Finally, we will map a sensory route for auditory information to inform OFC representations and test the hypothesis that auditory cortex lesions lead to deaf-hearing, the ability to discriminate sounds without perceptual confidence.  These contributions are significant, in our opinion, because they will provide critical missing information about the algorithmic and neural foundations of decision confidence, a key cognitive variable. Our approach is innovative, chiefly because we have developed a computational and behavioral framework to study confidence in rats. Beyond these mechanistic studies, the proposed work will advance knowledge about the frontal cortical logic of cognitive variable representations and inform an improved framework for understanding how impairments in a single brain area can lead to a wide range of psychiatric disorders, as seen in depression, obsessive- compulsive and psychotic disorders. Project narrative This proposal aims to identify the computational algorithms of two confidence-guided behaviors, time investment and choice strategy updating, and the neural processes underlying these. We will use a combination of electrophysiology, viral tracing, optogenetics in a quantitative confidence-reporting behavior in rats, interpreted with computational modeling and statistical analysis.

"Mechanisms for internally and externally guided sensorimotor learning PROJECT SUMMARY Expressive social behaviors, including speech and music, are culturally transmitted from a tutor to a pupil. Such learning depends on a pupil’s ability to integrate social and sensory cues provided by a tutor performing the relevant behavior. Once learned, the underlying motor program must be coordinated with a range of innate motor programs to generate holistic behaviors necessary to effective social signaling. The central hypothesis that this proposal seeks to test is that the same brain circuitry that enables the pupil to integrate social and sensory cues from an adult tutor also function in the adult to enable integration of the learned and innate programs necessary to effective social signaling. In the past cycle, we discovered where neural signals encoding social and sensory cues provided by a tutor are integrated in the pupil’s brain. Specifically, we showed that neurons in a midbrain dopamine cell group (A11) in a juvenile songbird are selectively excited during interactions with a singing adult male tutor, and that pairing song playback with the optogenetically- triggered release of dopamine from A11 terminals in a sensorimotor cortical analogue (HVC) is sufficient to drive song copying. Despite these important insights, exactly when and how tutor experience transforms auditory and motor coding in HVC to facilitate vocal learning remains unknown. Therefore, in Aim 1 we will use multiphoton (2p) longitudinal imaging, fiber photometry to test the hypothesis that tutor experience rapidly strengthens the auditory and motor network in the pupil’s HVC. We will also use novel machine learning tools for vocal analysis and optogenetic methods to test the idea that these sensorimotor changes enable HVC to enhance the acoustic complexity of the pupil’s song, a first step in vocal copying. Our prior studies support the idea that social and auditory cues provided by the tutor drive coincident DA release and auditory synaptic activity in the pupil’s HVC, rapidly potentiating sensorimotor synapses in this region. Therefore, in Aim 2, we will use ex vivo channelrhodopsin circuit-mapping to test the hypothesis that coincident DA release and auditory synaptic actvity rapidly potentiates auditory synapses onto HVC interneurons, and that these effects are strongest during juvenile sensitive periods for learning. Notably, the courtship display of the adult songbird includes a learned song that is seamlessly coordinated with a variety of innate behaviors, including female- directed calling, orientation, and pursuit. In Preliminary Studies, we found that lesions of A11’s axon terminals in HVC of the adult male finch abolish female-directed singing without affecting his innate courtship behaviors. In contrast, selectively ablating A11 cell bodies abolished all of the male’s courtship behaviors. In Aim 3, we will map, monitor and manipulate A11’s projections to HVC and other motor centers to test the idea that A11 acts as a central hub to enable the seamless and rapid coordination of learned and innate motor programs in response to social cues provided by a nearby female. PROJECT NARRATIVE Social learning is the foundation for speech, music and athletics but full mastery of these complex behaviors requires the fluent coordination of learned and innate motor programs. The goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that a neural circuit comprising a midbrain dopamine cell group and its cortical and subcortical projections is crucial to social learning and the coordination of learned and innate motor programs.",Mechanisms for internally and externally guided sensorimotor learning,10305438,R01NS099288,"['Acoustic Stimulation ', ' Auditory Stimulation ', ' Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Stem ', ' Brainstem ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Courtship ', ' Cues ', ' Dopamine ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Facial Expression ', ' face expression ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Gestures ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Influentials ', ' Instinct ', ' Innate Behavior ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Learning ', ' male ', ' Maps ', ' Memory ', ' Midbrain structure ', ' Mesencephalon ', ' Mid-brain ', ' Midbrain ', ' Methods ', ' Music ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Photometry ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Pupil ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Speech ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Prosencephalon ', ' Fore-Brain ', ' Forebrain ', ' Bathing ', ' Baths ', ' Site ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Presynaptic Terminals ', ' Axon Terminals ', ' Presynaptic Nerve Endings ', ' Synaptic Boutons ', ' Synaptic Terminals ', ' Lesion ', ' Fiber ', ' insight ', ' Whole-Cell Recordings ', ' analog ', ' zebra finch ', ' Finches ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Auditory ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Oscines ', ' song bird ', ' Songbirds ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' axon signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neurotransmission ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' DA Neuron ', ' Dopamine neuron ', ' dopaminergic neuron ', ' Emotional ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' vocal learning ', ' Athletic ', ' Motor ', ' Monitor ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' Coupled ', ' motor learning ', ' locomotor learning ', ' molecular phenotype ', ' optogenetics ', ' social learning ', ' brain circuitry ', ' learning outcome ', ' tutoring ', ' tutorial support ', ' serial imaging ', ' longitudinal imaging ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NINDS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,354988,NC-04
"Auditory precursors of language delay in toddlers with autism spectrum disorders Abstract Language delay and impairments are common in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), as are sensory (including auditory) anomalies. Since acquisition of spoken language relies on the integrity of the auditory system, language delay and impairments may be related to sound processing abnormalities that are frequently observed in children with ASDs (despite normal peripheral hearing). However, it is not understood if and how early auditory brain anomalies may developmentally contribute to impaired language development.  This project will examine the maturation of auditory and language systems in the brain across early childhood, during the critical period for language acquisition. We will employ a longitudinal design and multimodal neuroimaging, including high-resolution anatomical, diffusion, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with added frequent and extensive behavioral and neuropsychological assessments. Our central hypothesis is that early disruptions to cortical sound processing precede and predict language impairments in ASDs and may thus be considered causal contributors – a hypothesis that has been frequently considered in the literature, but never tested at the neural level.  Our aims are to thoroughly characterize the structural integrity and functional differentiation of the cortical auditory and language systems (Aim 1) and their maturational trajectories (Aim 2) in toddlers with ASDs and age-matched typically developing peers. This will allow us to establish whether neural abnormalities in cortical processing of complex sounds in toddlers are predictive of language development and social behavior at the pre-school age (Aim 3). The rationale and translational significance of this project are that identification of alterations in brain development linked to language delay and impairment in the first years of life will allow for more targeted interventions in the auditory domain at a time when they are most effective. Project narrative The project aims to find causes of language impairment in children with autism spectrum disorders by studying the brain organization of the auditory system in toddlers at the very earliest age of provisional diagnosis. The overarching hypothesis is that atypical auditory processing contributes to language delay and impairment. Pinpointing auditory causes of language problems in children with ASDs may inform early interventions.",Auditory precursors of language delay in toddlers with autism spectrum disorders,10132296,R01DC017736,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Auditory area ', ' Auditory Cortex ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diffusion ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Hearing ', ' indexing ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' Language Development ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' language acquisition ', ' language learning ', ' Literature ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' pre-k ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' preschool ', ' Sleep ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sound ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Time ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' Neurites ', ' Anisotropy ', ' Organizational Change ', ' autistic children ', ' children with ASD ', ' children with autism ', ' children with autism spectrum disorder ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Peripheral ', ' Diffuse ', ' Link ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Morphology ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Research Priority ', ' Life ', ' Auditory ', ' Complex ', ' Radius ', ' Radial ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Auditory system ', ' myelination ', ' phonology ', ' early childhood ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Molecular Modeling Nucleic Acid Biochemistry ', ' Molecular Modeling Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Molecular Models ', ' molecular modeling ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Toddler ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Brain region ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' TEP1 ', ' TLP1 ', ' TP1 ', ' hTEP1 Gene ', ' TEP1 gene ', ' Length ', ' Symptoms ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Impairment ', ' critical period ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' longitudinal design ', ' language impairment ', ' translational impact ', ' auditory processing ', ' recruit ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' individuals with autism spectrum disorder ', ' autistic individuals ', ' individuals with ASD ', ' individuals with autism ', ' people with ASD ', ' people with autism ', ' people with autism spectrum disorder ', ' ']",NIDCD,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,588497,CA-53
"AUDITORY NEURAL FUNCTION IN IMPLANTED PATIENTS WITH USHER SYNDROME PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Usher syndrome (USH) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by hearing loss, visual impairment, and in some cases, vestibular dysfunction. It is the leading cause of hereditary deaf-blindness in humans. USH causes extensive degeneration in the cochlear nerve (CN), especially in CN fibers innervating the base of the cochlea. Whereas there is no treatment for arresting this degenerative process or for restoring visual loss, the restoration of auditory input is possible with cochlear implantation. Due to the progressive deterioration in vision, using visual cues for communication will eventually become impossible. Therefore, the importance of optimizing auditory inputs through cochlear implants (CIs) for patients with USH is paramount. However, patients with USH have much higher rates of neurological, mental, or behavioral disorders than the general CI patient population, which limits their ability to provide reliable behavioral responses or sufficient verbal descriptions of their auditory perception, especially for pediatric patients. In addition, optimal programming parameters for CI users with CN damage differ from those used in typical CI users due to declined CN responsiveness to electrical stimulation. As a result, the clinical programming process in implanted patients with USH can be extremely challenging. To date, auditory neural encoding of electrical stimulation in patients with USH has not been systematically evaluated. Consequently, the field lacks evidence-based practice guidelines for managing implanted patients with USH. For patients who cannot provide reliable feedback, clinicians rely on a “trial-and-error” approach for adjusting CI programming settings, which ultimately may not result in appropriate programming maps for individual patients. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop objective clinical tools for optimizing CI settings for these patients. As the first step toward developing evidence-based practice for managing patients with USH, this study evaluates local neural health, as well as the neural encoding of temporal and spectral cues at the CN in implanted patients with USH. Aim 1 will determine local CN health in patients with USH by assessing the sensitivity of the electrically evoked compound action potential to changes in interphase gap and pulse polarity. Aim 2 will determine group differences in neural encoding of temporal and spectral cues at the CN between patients with USH and patients with idiopathic hearing loss. Aim 3 will use supervised machine learning techniques to develop an objective tool for assessing the electrode-neuron interface at individual electrode locations. Results of this study have high scientific significance because they will establish how CN degeneration affects neural encoding and processing of electrical stimulation, and identify tests that distinguish the loss of spiral ganglion neurons from the loss of peripheral axons. Results of this study also have high clinical significance because they will 1) lay the groundwork for developing effective, evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for managing patients with USH, and 2) yield an objective tool for assessing the site-specific electrode-neuron interface in all CI users, which is foundational for creating optimal programming maps for individual patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed study is relevant to public health because it aims to better understand neural encoding and processing of electrical stimulation in patients with Usher syndrome (USH) – an autosomal recessive disorder that is the leading cause of hereditary deaf-blindness. Results from this study will have a broad impact on the field by 1) establishing how cochlear nerve degeneration affects neural encoding and processing of electrical stimulation, 2) identifying tests that distinctly evaluate the loss in the spiral ganglion cells vs the loss in the peripheral axon, and 3) yielding an objective tool for assessing the site-specific electrode-neural interface in all cochlear implant users. Results from this study will also have a targeted impact on implanted patients with USH by laying the groundwork for developing an effective, evidence-based clinical practice for managing these patients. This project is relevant to the mission of NIH because it seeks fundamental knowledge about the nature of electrical hearing in patients with USH and strives to apply this knowledge to reduce disability in all patients with cochlear implants.",AUDITORY NEURAL FUNCTION IN IMPLANTED PATIENTS WITH USHER SYNDROME,10192995,R21DC019458,"['Accounting ', ' Action Potentials ', ' Affect ', ' Auditory Perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' sound perception ', ' Axon ', ' Behavior Disorders ', ' behavioral disorder ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Cochlea ', ' Cochlear Organ ', ' Cochlear Implants ', ' Cochlear Prosthesis ', ' Cochlear Nerve ', ' Cochlear Root of Acoustic Nerve ', ' Cochlear Root of Eighth Cranial Nerve ', ' Communication ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cues ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electric Stimulation ', ' Electrical Stimulation ', ' electrostimulation ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hearing ', ' Sensorineural Hearing Loss ', ' Sensorineural Deafness ', ' Sensory Hearing Loss ', ' sensorineural hearing impairment ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Interphase ', ' Maps ', ' Mission ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Nerve Fibers ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Retinitis Pigmentosa ', ' Pigmentary Retinopathy ', ' Tapetoretinal Degeneration ', ' rod-cone dystrophy ', ' Speech ', ' Speech Perception ', ' spiral ganglion ', ' Corti ganglion ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual impairment ', ' Diminished Vision ', ' Low Vision ', ' Partial Sight ', ' Reduced Vision ', ' Subnormal Vision ', ' vision impairment ', ' visually impaired ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Peripheral ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Refractory ', ' Gap Junctions ', ' Communicating Junction ', ' Low-resistance Junction ', ' Nexus ', ' Nexus Junction ', ' ganglion cell ', ' gangliocyte ', ' disability ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Usher Syndrome ', ' Graefe-Usher syndrome ', ' Hallgren syndrome ', "" Usher's syndrome "", ' dystrophia retinae pigmentosa-dysostosis syndrome ', ' dystrophia retinae-dysacousis syndrome ', ' retinitis pigmentosa-congenital deafness syndrome ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Clinical Practice Guideline ', ' Cochlear Implantation ', ' Cochlear Prosthesis Implantation ', ' Cochlear implant procedure ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Adopted ', ' Frequencies ', ' Hereditary ', ' Inherited ', ' Auditory ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' restoration ', ' Location ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' Auditory system ', ' nerve cell death ', ' nerve cell loss ', ' neuron cell death ', ' neuron cell loss ', ' neuron death ', ' neuronal cell death ', ' neuronal cell loss ', ' neuronal death ', ' neuronal loss ', ' neuron loss ', ' functional recovery ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Practice Management ', ' neural function ', ' Neurophysiology -

"Decoding parametric attributes of auditory working memories from human brain activity Decoding parametric attributes of auditory working memories from human brain activity Auditory working memory (WM) refers to our capacity to maintain and manipulate relevant sound information to support communication and problem solving. Auditory WM dysfunctions are evidenced in individuals with speech perception disorders, language and reading impairments, and other disorders involving dysfunction of auditory cognition, such as central auditory processing disorders (CAPD). Better understanding of auditory WM would help develop more precise biomarkers and targeted interventions for these deficits. Evidence for neuronal activation related to auditory WM patterns have been found in laboratory animals as well as in non- invasive human neuroimaging studies, both in auditory cortices (AC) and elsewhere in the brain. Recent human fMRI data also provide some evidence on item-specific activation patterns in ACs and frontal cortices. However, exactly where in the brain auditory WM content is stored and, more importantly, how the memorized information is represented is still unclear.  This research program pursues a better understanding of human auditory WM by attempting to infer its contents from the brain: Using state-of-the-art non-invasive neuroimaging and advanced signal-analysis methods we will search for cortical activation patterns that would predict item-specific WM information. We will examine brain function non-invasively with magneto- and electroencephalography (MEG/EEG), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and functional MRI (fMRI), and validate the findings using intracranial EEG (iEEG) measurements in presurgical patients. Recent studies suggest that, instead of persistent activation patterns, WM is supported by short-term synaptic facilitation, i.e., ""activity-silent"" population-level mechanisms. We hypothesize that these activity-silent representations could be decoded by analyzing the aftereffects of generic auditory ""impulse stimuli"" or TMS, which are utilized to ""ping"" the underlying cortical network during memory maintenance. We also hypothesize that although auditory WM likely involves co-operation of multiple brain regions, which are involved in articulatory-motor functions, perceptual categorization, or semantic processing, the retention of auditory-sensory attributes such as spectrotemporal modulation patterns critically depends on ACs. To examine WM of such auditory attributes, we will use tasks with dynamic ripple sound stimuli, which are spectrotemporally similar to human vocalizations but resist non-auditory processing strategies.  The major significance of this project is that it will increase the understanding of auditory WM, a crucial cognitive function whose neuronal bases have remained elusive. The results may also help develop more precise tools for characterizing auditory WM dysfunctions in hearing and communication deficits as well as in disorders such as dyslexia, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and schizophrenia. Auditory working memory (WM) refers to our capacity to maintain and manipulate relevant sound information to support communication and problem solving. Our research program pursues a better theoretical understanding of this crucial cognitive function using advanced multimodal neuroimaging methods, validated using intracranial recordings in pre-surgical patients.

"The Biennial VA NCRAR Scientific Conference Series Project Summary/Abstract  The NCRAR will hold its next three Biennial Conferences starting with “Vestibular Disorders: From Cause to Cure” in fall 2021. Subsequent conference topics are tentatively titled “Post-Pandemic Innovations in Connected Audiology” and “Multi-Sensory Approaches to Auditory Rehabilitation”, to be refined based on developments in the field and participant feedback from the previous conference. These three-day intensive conferences will bring together basic and translational scientists, clinicians, patients, and health policymakers to promote the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of patients with hearing and balance disorders. We hypothesize that clinical outcomes will be improved if they incorporate a collaborative, interprofessional clinical approach shaped by both the pathophysiology and the perspective of the patient. Consistent with the NIDCD's 2017-2021 Strategic Plan, these conferences aim to meet the critical need for multidisciplinary approaches to diagnose and treat auditory and vestibular deficits appropriately within a patient-centered care model.  The objectives of the 2021 conference are to enhance knowledge of the mechanisms, diagnosis, and clinical management of vestibular dysfunction. Specific topics include cellular regeneration, aging, head trauma, psychophysical testing, artificial-intelligence guided diagnosis, virtual reality-based rehabilitation, and vestibular implantation. Panel discussions with patients and experts and curated matching of mentors with students provide valuable communication and networking opportunities. A novel aspect of the conference series is the inclusion of stakeholders, such as patients and policymakers, within the clinical teaching sessions. An innovative aspect is to optimize the relevance of the case-study focused problem-based learning sessions by polling attendees regarding their challenges in clinical research and patient care. A closing discussion with the presenters and audience will recap recommendations for future research and developments in clinical care.  The conference will be limited to 200 attendees to create an intimate environment enhancing open communication. Ten scholarships provided to students and 5 to practicing clinicians will attract participants from outside the scientific community, with at least 8 scholarships awarded to applicants who are women, part of a racial/ethnic minority group, or have a disability. The conference will be publicized through social media, email and other professional meetings. Announcements will be posted on the NCRAR website, professional organization websites, and published in specialty journals. Conference content will be disseminated to non- attendees via a special issue of the American Journal of Audiology, and the conference presentations will be available at a reduced price on the NCRAR website (with presenter permissions). The purpose of this grant is to supplement the funding of three conferences (“Vestibular Disorders: From Cause to Cure”, “Post-pandemic Innovations in Connected Audiology”, and “Multi-Sensory Approaches to Auditory Rehabilitation”) to be hosted by the National Center for Rehabilitative Auditory Research between 2021 and 2025. The aim of these conferences is to improve auditory research and clinical practice by sharing the knowledge and perspectives of patients, clinicians, scientists and health policy stakeholders to alleviate the burden of auditory and vestibular deficits on function and quality of life. This conference is unique in its multidisciplinary, multiple stake holder approach to providing specialized training in clinical innovations, identification of the critical gaps in research, and appreciation of the health system barriers to advances in the field.",The Biennial VA NCRAR Scientific Conference Series,10318494,R13DC019837,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI

"Tinnitus: Audiological measures and genetic susceptibility PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Tinnitus, the phantom perception of sound in absence of an external sound source, is a prevalent hearing disorder. To date, the exact neural and molecular mechanisms underlying tinnitus are not known. Tinnitus is associated with a number of otological diseases and clinical conditions; however, almost 50% of tinnitus cases are not attributable to any known cause (Stouffer & Tyler, 1990). There is likely a genetic component to tinnitus (Sand et al, 2007). A critical gap in the knowledge base is how to clinically identify those who are genetically predisposed to tinnitus well before they acquire this hearing health issue. The short-term goal of this R21 Early Career Research PAR 16-057 application, entitled “Tinnitus: Audiological measures and genetic susceptibility,” is to identify detailed phenotypic and genotypic profiles of chronic tinnitus in young adults. The application is proposed by a team of researchers: The PI is Ishan Bhatt, Ph.D. in audiology (CCC-A, FAAA), who is working with Co-PI’s Jason Wilder, Ph.D. in genetics, Jin Wang, Ph.D. in statistics, and Raquel Dias, Ph.D. in Bioinformatics. This project will fill the gap in knowledge by identifying the critical variables associated with a genetic predisposition to CT. This investigation will include college-aged young participants to control for age- related confounding variables such as systemic diseases and hearing loss. According to the PI’s pilot study (Bhatt, 2017a), the estimated prevalence of chronic tinnitus (CT), acute tinnitus (AT) and no tinnitus (NT) is around 8%, 13% and 79%, respectively. To accomplish our short-term goal, we will conduct a case-control- control exonic genome-wide association study (GWAS) (N = 300) in which subjects will be divided into three groups: those with (1) CT (tinnitus for > 1 year; n=100), (2) AT (tinnitus for ≤ 1 year, presumably due to acute environmental exposure; n=100); and (3) NT (no experience of tinnitus in a lifetime; n=100). The Specific Aims are: (1) to identify associations between exonic Single Nucleotide Polymorhisms (SNPs) and tinnitus phenotype. Based on the criteria laid out in the preliminary studies (Bhatt, 2017a; Bhatt et al., 2016; Phillip et al., 2015), our working hypothesis is that causal SNPs will exhibit a higher frequency of a specific genotype for subjects with CT compared to subjects with AT and NT. (2) To identify association between selected SNPs in a candidate set of genes and audiologic measures among subjects with CT, AT and NT, Based on our preliminary studies (Bhatt et al., 2016, Phillips et al., 2015), our working hypothesis is that subjects with causal alleles for CT will exhibit pathophysiological variation in the audiometric measures. Significance: Successful completion of this project will enable us to identify phenotypic and genotypic profiles of CT. This will help us to achieve our long term goal, which is to develop a genetic Risk Profile that can be used by health-care providers, and educators (e.g., health professionals, music and industrial arts teachers) to identify individuals genetically at risk for CT.

"Effects of Lifetime Noise Exposure Viewed Through the Brainstem Reflex Bifocals: Middle Ear Muscle Reflex and Medial Olivocochlear Reflex Project Summary Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) affects nearly one in four adults in the United States. With recent discov- eries pertaining to cochlear synaptopathy and outer hair cell (OHC) loss in the extended high frequencies, it is clear that much of the early NIHL remains `hidden' under traditional audiological scrutiny. Without early de- tection and intervention, such damage can progress into more severe hearing loss. Thus a critical window for therapeutics/lifestyle changes may go unutilized. However, there are currently no feasible tools that can identify early hearing damage. Prior studies that test the integrity of the auditory afferent pathway have not produced conclusive results. However, short- and long-term noise exposure-related peripheral damage are correlated with changes in the auditory efferent system. Speciﬁcally, hyperactivity in the medial olivocochlear reﬂex (MOCR) and threshold elevation of the middle ear muscle reﬂex (MEMR) have been reported. Given the protective roles of the MOCR and the MEMR through inhibition of peripheral inputs, and their differential changes with damage, we argue that a combined assay of MOCR and MEMR may serve as a marker for early hearing damage in humans.  Using a novel otoacoustic emission (OAE)-based efferent assay, in the proposed studies we aim to (1) eval- uate long-term age-speciﬁc changes in efferent and afferent function due to noise exposure and (2) evaluate short-term changes in efferent and afferent function due to noise exposure. We will investigate the concurrent working of the two reﬂexes across a wide age range (18-50 years) and noise exposure by recruiting individuals from high noise exposure (musicians, veterans, construction workers, farmer) and low noise exposure occupa- tions (students, professors). To evaluate short-term changes due to noise exposure, we will test participants before and after their typical work day. For reliable exposure stratiﬁcation, noise exposure will be objectively quantiﬁed using 5-day sound dosimetry. We will also use the most sensitive afferent measures to allow compari- son with efferent measures. Machine learning approaches will be employed to ascertain relationships among the cochlear, afferent, and efferent function for short- and long-term noise exposures.  Findings from project 1 will reveal if the combined MOCR and MEMR metrics can delineate noise exposure effects from aging, and highlight the relationships among cochlear, afferent, and efferent measures. Findings from project 2 will reveal if long-term noise exposure predicts short-term changes following noise exposure and vice- versa. A better understanding of short- and long-term changes in the auditory system following noise exposure will aid in the development of (1) an objective rapid screening test of the auditory efferents capable of detecting noise exposure-related hearing damage and (2) a statistical model to enable predicting impending damage based on efferent function. Together, these tools will contribute to early detection and promote hearing conservation. Project Narrative This study will investigate the role of the auditory efferents, the medial olivocochlear reﬂex (MOCR) and the middle ear muscle reﬂex (MEMR), in short- and long-term noise exposure-related changes in the auditory system. Additionally, statistical models will be developed to understand the relationship between efferent and afferent candidate measures of hearing damage. The outcomes of this study will lay the foundation for a screening test of early hearing damage based on the integrity of the auditory efferent system.",Effects of Lifetime Noise Exposure Viewed Through the Brainstem Reflex Bifocals: Middle Ear Muscle Reflex and Medial Olivocochlear Reflex,10204332,R21DC018108,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Afferent Pathways ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Brain Stem ', ' Brainstem ', ' Cochlea ', ' Cochlear Organ ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Control Groups ', ' middle ear ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Hearing ', ' Noise-Induced Hearing Loss ', ' noise related hearing loss ', ' noise-induced hearing impairment ', ' Hearing Tests ', ' Audiogram ', ' Audiometric Test ', ' Audiometry ', ' auditory tests ', ' hearing assessment ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Kinetics ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Noise ', ' Occupational Noise ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patents ', ' Reflex action ', ' Reflex ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' sound ', ' Students ', ' Temporary Threshold Shift ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Veterans ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' otoacoustic emission ', ' base ', ' Medial ', ' Peripheral ', ' Clinical ', ' Outer Hair Cells ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' farmer ', ' Individual ', ' Bilateral ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' aural muscle ', ' ear muscle ', ' Frequencies ', ' Auditory ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' Occupational ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Auditory system ', ' age group ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' musician ', ' professor ', ' dosimetry ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Hearing Loss ', ' Hypoacuses ', ' Hypoacusis ', ' dysfunctional hearing ', ' hearing defect ', ' hearing deficit ', ' hearing difficulty ', ' hearing disability ', ' hearing dysfunction ', ' hearing impairment ', ' Data ', ' Stratification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' age effect ', ' aging effect ', ' conditioning ', ' demographics ', ' therapeutic lifestyle change ', ' screening ', ' clinically translatable ', ' recruit ', ' normal hearing ', ' good hearing ', ' healthy hearing ', ' cochlear synaptopathy ', ' Hearing Protection ', ' protect hearing ', ' Rapid screening ', ' Hyperactivity ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2021,155333,WI-02
