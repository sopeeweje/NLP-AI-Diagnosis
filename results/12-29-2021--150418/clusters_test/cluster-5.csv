"Super-Resolution Tau PET Imaging for Alzheimer's Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Preclinical Alzheimer’s disease (the presymptomatic phase of Alzheimer’s disease) is characterized by pathophysiological changes without measurable cognitive decline and begins decades before the onset of cognitive symptoms. Preclinical Alzheimer’s disease research is in pressing need of new biomarker endpoints to enable disease monitoring before traditional cognitive endpoints are measurable. The overarching research objectives of this R03 Small Project Grant are to develop a super-resolution (SR) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging framework for tau (a pathophysiological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease) and to assess the clinical utility of localized outcome measures obtained from SR PET images. Studies show that tau pathology in the medial temporal lobe is an important marker of cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease. Cohorts focused on preclinical Alzheimer’s now incorporate serialized 18F-flortaucipir PET scans for longitudinal tracking of tau accumulation in key anatomical regions-of-interest (ROIs). The quantitative accuracy of tau PET, however, is degraded by the limited spatial resolution capabilities of PET, which lead to inter-ROI spillover and partial volume effects. The problem is further compounded in studies spanning several decades, many of which were commenced on legacy scanners with even lower resolution capabilities than the current state of the art. Additionally, many longitudinal studies began on older scanners and later transitioned to newer models posing a multi-scanner data harmonization challenge. The proposed SR framework will perform a mapping from a low- resolution scanner’s image domain to a high-resolution scanner’s image domain and enable PET resolution recovery and data harmonization. Underlying the proposed framework is a neural network model that can be adversarially trained in self-supervised mode without requiring paired input/output image samples for training. This critical feature ensures practical clinical utility of the method as the need for paired low-resolution and high- resolution datasets from the same subject with similar tracer dose and scan settings is a major barrier for the clinical translatability of simpler supervised alternatives for SR. The proposed network, although trained using unpaired clinical data, receives guidance from an ancillary neural network separately pretrained using paired simulation datasets. For this purpose, we will synthesize paired low- and high-resolution images from a series of digital tau phantoms that will be created for this project. Training and validation of the self-supervised SR framework will be performed via secondary use of de-identified 18F-flortaucipir PET scans from the Harvard Aging Brain Study, a longitudinal cohort focused on preclinical Alzheimer’s disease. We will evaluate SR performance using a variety of image quality metrics. To assess the clinical utility of localized super-resolution measures, we will perform cross-sectional statistical power analyses that estimate sample sizes per arm needed to power clinical trials. Accurate localized measures of tau generated by this project could enable early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and facilitate ongoing clinical trials by reducing sample sizes required for a given effect size. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this R03 Small Project Grant is to develop methods for generating high-resolution images of abnormal tau protein tangles, which are a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease. This will be achieved by building a self-supervised super-resolution framework based on a deep neural network for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of tau. The proposed imaging technique can facilitate early diagnosis and accurate monitoring of Alzheimer’s disease.",Super-Resolution Tau PET Imaging for Alzheimer's

"Machine learning to predict incident MCI using standard clinical measures PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT While important progress has been achieved in our understanding of the clinical and neuroimaging characteristics, as well as genomic and neurobiological substrates of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias, identifying individuals at a preclinical stage remains a vital priority and substantial challenge. The early and accurate identification of at-risk individuals becomes particularly important as we embark on next- generation randomized clinical trials to prevent or delay the onset of AD. The NIA recently convened a workshop involving experts from academia, nonprofit organizations, and industry with the goal to consider cost- effective strategies to improve the early detection of cognitive decline. A key recommendation by workshop participants emphasized opportunities to leverage existing longitudinal studies and apply machine learning techniques as a cost-effective approach to detect early cognitive decline. The current proposal represents a targeted step toward achieving those recommendations by leveraging a large and ongoing longitudinal study of APOE genotype and cognition (led by Dr. Richard Caselli at Mayo Clinic Arizona), and applies machine learning to identify individuals at risk for incident MCI at the earliest possible detectable stage. Machine-learning (ML) techniques implement predictive algorithms to find optimal mathematical and computational solutions to a set of complex problems. In dementia research, ML and pattern detection algorithms have been applied mainly to neuroimaging data, or neuroimaging data combined with clinical and genetic data, to distinguish prevalent MCI or AD cases from healthy controls. However, it remains to be determined whether ML algorithms can be marshalled as a key strategic and predictive approach to identify cognitively normal individuals at the earliest detectable stage of incipient decline. To address this gap in knowledge, the proposal aims to: (1) Investigate whether subtle variations among standard clinical and cognitive measures at baseline are associated with subsequent decline and incident MCI. Methods to achieve this aim consist of an ensemble ML approach, anchored by a random forests learning algorithm, applied to baseline demographic, clinical, and cognitive data as well as APOE genotype in a cohort of 784 adults. (2) Develop a probabilistic algorithm that predicts out-of-sample incident MCI cases. This aim will be accomplished by selecting 80% of the longitudinal data as an in-sample subset and using a dynamic Bayesian network approach to model the probabilistic trajectories of diagnosis at each study visit. With this Bayesian model, it will be possible to develop an algorithm to estimate each person’s unique risk of future MCI diagnosis. (3) Validate the predictive diagnostic algorithm using the remaining 20% of longitudinal data (out-of- sample subset), plus data from additional accruals during the intervening period. Successful completion of this project will be relevant to public health by helping to improve the prediction of dementia at a very early stage using standard clinical measures, and potentially aid in the implementation of therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE As our scientific field embarks on next-generation preclinical trials to prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer’s disease, it become critically important to identify accurately who amongst cognitively healthy adults is at an increased risk of cognitive decline and development of dementia. Consistent with the recommendations from the NIA to find cost-effective solutions that capitalize on existing data and apply new methods from artificial intelligence, the current proposal aims to apply machine learning techniques to identify, at the earliest possible detectable stage, those individuals who are at increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease. Successful completion of this project will be relevant to public health as it may help to improve the prediction of dementia at a very early stage using standard clinical measures, and potentially aid in the implementation of therapeutic interventions.",Machine learning to predict incident MCI using standard clinical measures,10108473,R03AG070486,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', '

"National Cohort Studies of Alzheimer's Disease, Related Dementias and Air Pollution Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, where currently 5.8 million people are living with AD dementias, and this number is projected to almost triple to 13.8 million by 2050. In addition AD and related dementias (AD/ADRD) healthcare costs for people ≥65 years were an estimated $277 billion in 2018. Although putative risk and protective factors have been identified, published studies have been unable to identify how to prevent and mitigate disease progression and who is most vulnerable mostly because the existing studies are based on small sample size and lack statistical power to disentangle the effects of different factors. Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) (a ubiquitous yet modifiable exposure dangerous to the aging brain) has been associated with decreased cognitive function, faster cognitive decline, dementia, AD, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Toxicological and human studies provide evidence of an association between air pollution and neurodegeneration, highlighting potential biological pathways that include systemic inflammation and oxidative stress. In response to PAR-17-054, our goal is to leverage massive nationwide datasets (Medicare and Medicaid), coupled with advanced statistical methods, to overcome the limitations of existing studies and clarify risk and protective factors for AD/ADRD. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will conduct national epidemiological studies using Medicare and Medicaid claims for the period 2000-2021 for the continental US, to estimate the association between exposure to air pollution and the time to the first AD/ADRD hospitalization. Among enrollees that have been hospitalized for AD/ADRD or MCI we will assess whether air pollution exposure increases risk of mortality, and/or accelerates re-hospitalization for AD/ADRD. In Aim 2 we will apply machine learning methods to identify co-occurrence of individual-level (previous hospitalizations, race, age, and sex), environmental (weather, green space, and noise), and SES risk (or protective) factors to determine which population subgroups are most/least at risk for AD/ADRD hospitalization and progression following air pollution exposure. In Aim 3 we will develop methods to overcome statistical challenges including (1) disentangle the effects of air pollution exposure from other confounding factors by leveraging approaches for causal inference, and (2) correct for potential outcome misclassification. We will conduct side-by-side epidemiological analyses using traditional methods (e.g. regression) and causal inference and machine learning approaches to understand which statistical challenges require more sophisticated approaches. To ensure transparency and reproducibility, we will provide peer-reviewed open-source software so other investigators may implement our methods. In summary the results of this proposal will characterize the link between air pollution exposure and AD/ADRD hospitalization and progression, will identify the multiple modifiable risk and protective factors that determine vulnerability in AD/ADRD, and provide the foundation for implementable actions to prevent and reduce this enormous health burden. This project will leverage data on two cohorts (Medicaid and Medicare enrollees) to characterize the impact of air pollution on risk for and progression of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD), and identify the complex interactions of individual-level, environmental and societal factors that lead to increased vulnerability in AD/ADRD. We will develop innovative, transparent, and reproducible methods to address current statistical challenges including outcome misclassification. We will determine the impact of multiple inter-related environmental protective and risk factors to address the multi-factorial AD/ADRD health burden.","National Cohort Studies of Alzheimer's Disease, Related Dementias and Air Pollution",10134188,R01AG066793,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Air Pollution ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Neuroglia ', ' Glia ', ' Glial Cells ', "" Kolliker's reticulum "", ' Neuroglial Cells ', ' Non-neuronal cell ', ' Nonneuronal cell ', ' nerve cement ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Nitrogen Dioxide ', ' NO2 ', ' Nitrogen Peroxide ', ' Noise ', ' Ozone ', ' O3 ', ' Peer Review ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Time ', ' Toxicology ', ' United States ', ' Weather ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Sample Size ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Funding ', ' Exposure to ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cognitive function ', ' Complex ', ' Side ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' cohort ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' response ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Subgroup ', ' Societal Factors ', ' Update ', ' Pathologic ', ' sex ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' nanoparticle ', ' nano particle ', ' nano-sized particle ', ' nanosized particle ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' modifiable risk ', ' malleable risk ', ' open source ', ' aging brain ', ' aged brain ', ' high risk ', ' Medicare claim ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' Green space ', ' greenspace ', ' fine particles ', ' PM2.5 ', ' fine particulate matter ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' protective factors ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' dementia risk ', ' risk factor for dementia ', ' risk for dementia ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' systemic inflammatory response ', ' systemic inflammation ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIA,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2021,732992,MA-07
"Lifecourse CVD Risk and Midlife Cognitive Trajectories and Brain Aging: Implications for Alzheimer's and Dementia Prevention ABSTRACT Vascular health has emerged as one of the most important determinants of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Early adult and midlife cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and subclinical disease may be important drivers of cognitive decline in midlife, a period that most likely is critical for influencing later life dementia risk. Yet, few studies have investigated early adulthood CVD risk exposures, including timing of exposure and whether subthreshold levels impact later life cognition. To accomplish these goals, we propose, to add cognitive testing to the Year 35 visit of the ongoing multisite Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. At baseline, CARDIA enrolled 5,115 black and white participants (mean age 24) who have been carefully followed for 30 years and had cognitive testing at visit years 25 and 30. Cognitive evaluation at Year 35 will allow us to determine 10-year cognitive change (mean age 50 to 60) at a critical time point when cognitive decline starts to diverge and potentially impacts late-life dementia risk. Our specific aims are: 1) To determine, using a life-course approach, the independent associations of 10-year midlife cognitive decline with timing, level (both subthreshold and threshold) and trend in CVD risk factors including body mass index, blood pressure, and fasting glucose, assessed over 35 years from early adult to midlife; 2) To determine the association of 10-year midlife cognitive decline with novel subclinical CVD markers over time including carotid artery intima thickness, coronary artery calcification and cardiac function; 3) To determine whether CVD risk factors and subclinical CVD markers are associated with brain aging indices in midlife, derived by the application of machine-learning neuroimaging pattern analysis to brain MRI and diffusion tensor imaging data obtained on nearly 700 CARDIA participants at midlife; Exploratory) To assess black/white disparities in 10- year cognitive decline and determine the extent to which such disparities are explained by burden of CVD risk. Guided by strong preliminary data, our main hypothesis is that CVD risk factors begin to exert influence as early as the third decade of life and that subthreshold levels (eg systolic blood pressure ≥120 mm) are important drivers for this. In addition, we hypothesize that subclinical CVD measures (especially cardiac function and atherosclerosis) are associated with greater decline in midlife cognition and accelerated brain aging. No other study in the US has such comprehensive data on a wide array of early adult CVD risk factors that may influence cognitive aging. As an experienced multidisciplinary team using innovative statistical methods to analyze essentially unique longitudinal data on early adult and midlife CVD risk factors and subclinical disease, we have the opportunity to investigate the associations of these life-course exposures with cognitive decline and brain health in midlife. Identifying dementia risk factors early in the life-course may lead to interventions to help maintain healthy brain aging and prevent the onset of dementia. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to study how cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity may influence cognitive function changes in midlife. We will apply a life-course approach to this investigation by carefully studying how CVD risk and preclinical markers beginning in early adulthood (20s and 30s) may affect midlife cognitive functioning and brain aging. In this way, the study has great public health value as it will inform ways to possibly prevent Alzheimer disease and vascular changes in the brain.",Lifecourse CVD Risk and Midlife Cognitive Trajectories and Brain Aging: Implications for Alzheimer's and Dementia Prevention,10171753,R01AG063887,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Carotid Arteries ', ' Cognition ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' indexing ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Public Health ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' heart function ', ' cardiac function ', ' function of the heart ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Funding ', ' Atrophy ', ' Atrophic ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Prevention ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' BMI ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' cognitive change ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Disease Marker ', ' Cognitive ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Pathologic ', ' trend ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' coronary artery calcification ', ' coronary calcification ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' aging brain ', ' aged brain ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', ' critical period ', ' treatment strategy ', ' emerging adult ', ' early adulthood ', ' fasting glucose ', ' early life exposure ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study ', ' Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults ', ' racial disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' brain health ', ' black/white disparity ', ' Time trend ', ' Temporal trend ', ' Trends over time ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' dementia risk ', ' risk factor for dementia ', ' risk for dementia ', ' ']",NIA,NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE/RES/EDU,R01,2021,740671,CA-12
"Identifying Digital Phenotypes of Risk for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias Among Hispanics/Latinos PROJECT SUMMARY Hispanics/Latinos are at increased risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) compared to non-Hispanic Whites. While factors underlying this disparity are not well understood, increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk among Hispanics/Latinos is likely to be a contributory factor. Pathological changes of ADRD begin years before clinical symptoms become evident and interventions are most likely to confer benefit in the earliest stages of ADRD. There is a pressing need to develop tools to detect the earliest manifestations of ADRD, particularly in Hispanics, who develop symptoms of ADRD at earlier ages, yet are diagnosed at more advanced disease stages than other groups. A variety of behaviors show changes in the preclinical stages of ADRD, including sleep, gait speed, and physical activity, among others. Recent innovations in mobile technology now offer novel ways to collect, track, and analyze these behaviors passively and unobtrusively, as a person engages in their daily life. Our preliminary work demonstrated that the application of machine learning models to passively-collected digital health data from smartphones and wearables differentiated persons with and without mild cognitive impairment with 85% accuracy in a primarily non-Hispanic White sample. Guided by the NIA Health Disparities Research Framework, we propose to leverage artificial intelligence (AI)-powered analytics and insights, coupled with readily available sensors in consumer electronics (smartphones, wrist-worn wearables), to identify digital biomarkers of ADRD risk, with a focus on vascular contributions to dementia, among Hispanics/Latinos. Augmenting an existing cohort study of Hispanics/Latinos residing in Southern California, the proposed study has three principal aims: Aim 1 involves determining digital signatures of ADRD risk among Hispanics (N=300; aged 50-70 years) using integrated passive mobile sensing features, derived from smartphones and wrist-worn wearables, and machine learning methods. ADRD risk will be defined by cognitive status and CVD risk burden (diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, obesity, smoking) and will also incorporate apolipoprotein E (APOE-ε4) and plasma-based AD biomarkers for further classification of ADRD risk. Aim 2 investigates sex differences in digital signatures of ADRD risk and Aim 3 examines the impact of sociocultural factors (e.g., language use, acculturation) on these signatures. We will also investigate whether changes in digital data features predict longitudinal neurocognitive change over a span of three years in a subset of Hispanics with and without ADRD risk. Housed within a renowned research institution at the vanguard of ADRD research and engineering innovations, the proposed study includes a multidisciplinary team with expertise across all aspects of this cutting-edge proposal. Recognizing the value of a community- engaged research approach, we have partnered with community stakeholders to ensure the relevance of our study to the Hispanic community. Our work could revolutionize early detection of ADRD and reduce ADRD disparities by developing a low burden, low-cost approach to identify ADRD risk among Hispanics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Early detection of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) is paramount for prevention and treatment efforts, particularly in groups at increased risk for ADRD such as Hispanics/Latinos living in the United States. Consumer-grade mobile technologies present rich sources of data that can be collected passively in real world environments and can overcome the hurdles typically associated with traditional methods for identifying ADRD early. The proposed project will capture and analyze various streams of digital health data, passively-collected via smartphones and wrist-worn wearables, in order to identify digital signatures of ADRD risk in Hispanics/Latinos and reduce health disparities in this vulnerable and understudied segment of the U.S. population.",Identifying Digital Phenotypes of Risk for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias Among Hispanics/Latinos,10298104,R01AG070956,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Apolipoprotein E ', ' Apo-E ', ' ApoE ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' California ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Vascular Dementia ', ' Arteriosclerotic Dementia ', ' vascular contributions to dementia ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Electronics ', ' electronic device ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Gold ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' hypercholesterolemia ', ' Hypercholesteremia ', ' high blood cholesterol ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Incidence ', ' Language ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' literacy ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' neurofilament ', ' Neuropsychological Tests ', ' Neuropsychologic Tests ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Pathologic Processes ', ' Pathological Processes ', ' Phenotype ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Sleep ', ' Smoking ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Hispanics ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Latino ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Physical activity ', ' insight ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' tau-1 ', ' p-tau ', ' p-τ ', ' phospho-tau ', ' phospho-τ ', ' phosphorylated tau ', ' bilingual ', ' bilingualism ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Stream ', ' Source ', ' Test Result ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' advanced illness ', ' advanced disease ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Cognitive ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Pathologic ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' Underserved Population ', ' under served group ', ' under served people ', ' under served population ', ' underserved group ', ' underserved people ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' clinical care ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' health data ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile technology ', ' Gait speed ', ' secondary analysis ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' dementia risk ', ' risk factor for dementia ', ' risk for dementia ', ' Alzheimer’s disease biomarker ', "" Alzheimer's biomarker "", "" Alzheimer's disease biological marker "", ' Alzheimer’s biological marker ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Differences between sexes ', ' Differs between sexes ', ' Sexual differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' social culture ', ' socio-cultural ', ' sociocultural ', ' multiple data sources ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' digital health ', ' community engaged research ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2021,805050,CA-52
"Exploring the Use of Deep Learning Neural Networks to Improve Dementia Detection: Automating Coding of the Clock-Drawing Test Project Summary  Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), a leading cause of disability among older adults, has become a critical public health concern. The clock-drawing test (CDT), which measures multiple aspects of cognitive function including comprehension, visual spatial abilities, executive function and memory, has been widely used as a screening tool to detect dementia in clinical research, epidemiologic studies, and panel surveys. The CDT asks subjects to draw a clock, typically with hands showing ten after 11, and then assigns either a binary (e.g. normal vs. abnormal) or ordinal (e.g. 0 to 5) score. An important limitation in large-scale studies is that the CDT requires manual coding, which could result in biases if coders interpret and implement coding rules in different ways.  Several small-scale studies have explored the use of machine learning methods to automate CDT coding. Such studies, which have had limited success with ordinal coding, have used methods that are not designed specifically for complex image classification and are less effective than deep learning neural networks (DLNN), a new and promising area of machine learning. More recently, machine learning methods have been applied to digital CDT (dCDT), a form of CDT that uses a digital pen and tablet. Despite some promising results on small- scale data, thus far dCDT studies have only attempted to code binary categories.  The proposed study will develop advanced DLNN models to create and evaluate an intelligent CDT Clock Scoring system – CloSco – that will automatically code CDT images. We will use a large, publicly available repository of CDT images from the 2011-2019 National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS), a panel study of Medicare beneficiaries ages 65 and older funded by the National Institute on Aging. Specifically, we will: 1) Develop an automated CDT-coding system for both ordinal and continuous scores; 2) Evaluate the performance of the CloSco system and investigate the value of continuous CDT scoring for dementia classification and longitudinal CDT models; and 3) Prepare and disseminate NHATS public-use files and documentation with ordinal and continuous CDT codes assigned using CloSco along with the CloSco DLNN program. If successful, the DLNN programs may offer a model for automating coding of other widely available drawing tests used to evaluate a variety of cognitive functions. Project Narrative This project aims to improve dementia detection by automating coding of a widely used dementia screening test, the Clock Drawing Test (CDT). The proposed research will improve CDT-coding in large scale studies, facilitate longitudinal analysis of CDT performance, and improve dementia classification particularly for mild cognitive impairment.",Exploring the Use of Deep Learning Neural Networks to Improve Dementia Detection: Automating Coding of the Clock-Drawing Test,10293176,R21AG073971,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cognition ', ' Comparative Study ', ' Elements ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Intelligence ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Manuals ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Paper ', ' Public Health ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Tablets ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Writing ', ' Measures ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Individual ', ' Error Sources ', ' Funding ', ' Respondent ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' 65+ years old ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' old age ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Family Health ', ' Family health status ', ' Categories ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Social Support System ', ' Support System ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' performance tests ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Documentation ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' trend ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' beneficiary ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' National Institute of Aging ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' Visuospatial ', ' visual spatial ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' screening ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' artificial neural network ', ' artificial neural net ', ' computational neural network ', ' synthetic neural network ', ' deep learning ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' public repository ', ' publicly accessible repository ', ' publicly available repository ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', "" Alzheimer's disease test "", ' Alzheimer Disease test ', ' Alzheimer test ', "" Alzheimer's test "", ' test for Alzheimer ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2021,406555,MI-12
"Technology-Enabled Financial Planning for Caregivers and Clients with Reduced Capacity Abstract Caregivers of older adults with ADRD are the largest unpaid, and untrained healthcare workforce in the US, with family caregiving valued at $470 billion in 2013 (higher than total Medicaid spending for the same year). The temptation to take advantage of an impaired loved one may be exacerbated by the stress of taking over disorganized finances and absence of guidance. Lack of clinically guided financial support can also remove financial control from the person suffering from ADRD prematurely. The decision to transfer control is typically made by the untrained caregiver acting on instincts, not by a trained clinician (who does not typically advise on finances) or financial advisor (who does not have clinical training). Each year, around 15% of U.S. seniors are targeted by financial exploitation resulting in nearly $17 billion in losses annually. In over a third of these cases, $6.6 billion is lost to theft enabled by a trusting relationship with a caregiver (called elder financial abuse) annually, and even this may be an under-estimation. AARP describes an average loss of $120k per victim, almost what an average 50+ household has in savings. The stress and isolation of unpaid caregiver workload may lead to resentment and increased risk of financial abuse. There is a need for increased communication, education, and a clinically validated methodology for determining when it is necessary to begin transfer of control over finances. BSM proposes to develop a one-stop-shop technology enabled solution to address these three problems usable by a financial planner, older adult client, and caregiver. Project Narrative Caregivers of persons with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementia (ADRD) (also known as People with Dementia, or PwD) are a community in dire need of caregiver assistance, education, and training resources, including assistive-technology platforms.

"Towards Generating a Multimodal and Multivariate Classification Model from Imaging and Non-Imaging Measures for Accurate Diagnosis and Monitoring of Dementia in Parkinsons disease. PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of the proposed research is to identify the best predictive biomarkers of dementia in Parkinson’s disease (PDD) through a multimodal and multivariate statistical model utilizing both neuroimaging derived measures (diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI), resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI), and T1-weighted MRI measures) and non- imaging measures such as demographics (age, sex, years of education), clinical (disease duration and severity), genetics (LRRK2), and CSF-measures (Total Tau, β-Amyloid, α-synuclein). It is critical to identify biomarkers that can predict dementia in Parkinson’s disease (PD) as approximately 50-80% of PD patients develop PDD within twelve years of diagnosis. Identifying pathophysiology-based biomarkers that could identify PD patients at high risk for PDD reliably is critical for better prognostication, correct identification of PDD in its prodromal stage to recruit in new disease-modifying clinical trials, and better understanding the pathophysiological processes underlining PDD. The proposed project has two important components. The first component of the project is to understand the pathophysiological mechanism underlying PDD through sophisticated voxelwise dMRI-derived measures estimated using a multi-shell high angular and spatial resolution dMRI data acquisition, and understanding network-level white matter (WM)-derived structural connectivity and rsfMRI-derived functional connectivity in PDD. The second component of the project is to identify the biomarkers that predict PDD through multivariate statistical modelling by combining these sophisticated pathologically relevant neuroimaging measures with non-imaging measures (such as clinical, demographics, genetics, and CSF-measures). We will recruit demographically matched healthy controls (HC) along with demographically, disease duration, and disease severity matched PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), PD-non-MCI (PD-nMCI), and PDD for this project. We will acquire multi-shell dMRI data at three b-values, namely 500s/mm2, 1000s/mm2, and 2500s/mm2 with a high angular and spatial resolution and estimate various unbiased free-water (fiso) corrected Gaussian dMRI-derived measures along with non-Gaussian dMRI-derived measures such as diffusion kurtosis measures, and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging measures. We will further compare these measures between the groups to identify significant dMRI-derived measures separating the groups, and understanding the neuroanatomical correlates of these measures with various neuropsychological scores. Furthermore, we will estimate dMRI-derived structural connectivity and rsfMRI-derived functional connectivity to understand network-level discrepancies predicting PDD. These pathologically relevant neuroimaging measures will be further combined with various non-imaging measures through a novel machine learning algorithm to identify the comprehensive and best predictors of PDD. The tools developed in our proposal also has great potential for significantly advancing the understanding of other neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) thereby helping to understand AD- and PD-specific neuroanatomical changes predicting dementia. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is highly relevant to public health because identification of the Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients at a high-risk for developing dementia (PDD) is critical for better prognostication, correct identification of PDD in its prodromal stage to recruit in new disease-modifying clinical trials, and to better understand the pathophysiological processes underlining PDD. The proposed project identifies the best predictive biomarkers for PDD through examining the comprehensive Gaussian and non-Gaussian diffusion-MRI (dMRI)-derived white matter (WM) changes predicting PDD, examining the network-level discrepancies predicting PDD derived from dMRI-derived whole-brain structural connectivity and resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI)-derived whole-brain functional connectivity, and developing a multivariate and multimodal statistical model by combining these sophisticated pathologically relevant neuroimaging measures with non-imaging measures such as clinical (disease duration and severity), demographics (age, sex, years of education), genetics (LRRK2), and CSF- measures (β-Amyloid, α-Synuclein, tau) to identify the best predictive biomarkers of PDD through machine learning approach.

"Transforming residential palliative care for persons with dementia through behavioral economics and data science The central goal of this proposed Roybal Center is to develop, test, and implement novel interventions that bridge the dramatic gap between the supply of and need for palliative care services among persons with dementia (PWD) living in long-term services and support (LTSS) facilities, as well as their family caregivers. Several innovative aspects of this proposed Center position us to succeed in this challenging but increasingly important space. First, we have assembled a team comprising more 50 investigators and staff from 5 schools within the University of Pennsylvania, and the most accomplished investigators of palliative approaches to care for PWD from 11 peer institutions. These investigators possess content knowledge and tremendous expertise in leading all Stages of behavioral intervention development as defined by the NIH Stage Model. Second, we will support these behavioral scientists by linking them with Center faculty with expertise in several key methodologic areas including behavioral economics, data science, statistics, qualitative methods, health policy and economics, and implementation science. Our focus on translating behavioral economic insights to change the behaviors of clinicians and caregivers involved in the care of PWD builds on our recent success using similar approaches to improve palliative care delivery in outpatient and hospital settings. Our focus on using machine learning, natural language processing, and network methods will enable us to (a) identify mechanisms of clinician behavior that account for aggressive care for PWD, (b) identify PWD with the greatest unmet palliative care needs so as to sustainably target intervention delivery, and (c) more efficiently measure person-centered outcomes in the context of large, pragmatic trials of the most promising interventions. Third, this Center is being launched in partnership with Genesis HealthCare, the nation's largest owner of LTSS facilities, with 401 nursing homes and assisted living facilities across the U.S. These facilities provide ideal settings within which to develop and test interventions that will be effective and sustainable in the real world. Further, by developing and testing the interventions in these settings, while continually increasing our collaborations with other owners of LTSS facilities, we will be ideally positioned to implement effective interventions in the places in which the majority of Americans with dementia are cared for near the end of life. This Center will be directed by a Steering Committee, and will include a Management and Administrative Core housed within Penn's existing Palliative and Advanced Illness Research (PAIR) Center. A Pilot Core will select, guide, and monitor pilot projects chosen for funding each year. We propose two pilots for funding in the first year: a Stage I study that seeks to adapt a web-based advance care planning platform for use among PWD and their caregivers in LTSS settings, and a Stage 0 study that will use data science methods to identify clinician behaviors associated with hospitalization risk among PWD, yielding targets for future interventions. NARRATIVE Although most persons with dementia (PWD) die in nursing homes and other long-term services and support (LTSS) facilities, few interventions have improved the processes or outcomes of care for such patients. This Roybal Center will unite junior and senior physician, nurse, and social scientists with expertise in Stages 0-V behavioral intervention studies, behavioral economics, and data science with a shared goal to develop, test, and implement interventions to change the behaviors of clinicians and caregivers for PWD in LTSS facilities. We will achieve this goal by partnering with the nation's leading researchers in palliative care for PWD and the largest owner of nursing homes, using its facilities as sites for the pilot studies we will support.",Transforming residential palliative care for persons with dementia through behavioral economics and data science,10251982,P30AG064105,"['Arts ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Communication ', ' Computers ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' hospice environment ', ' Hospices ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Palliative Care ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' comfort care ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Physicians ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Science ', ' Societies ', ' statistics ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Businesses ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Mechanical ventilation ', ' mechanical respiratory assist ', ' mechanically ventilated ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Fostering ', ' Logistics ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' behavior change ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' Family-Centered Nursing ', ' Family Nursing ', ' success ', ' care delivery ', ' Advance Health Care Planning ', ' Advance Healthcare Planning ', ' Advance Care Planning ', ' advanced illness ', ' advanced disease ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' assisted living ', ' assistive living ', ' assistive living facilities ', ' Assisted Living Facilities ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Institution ', ' palliative ', ' Address ', ' end-of-life ', ' end of life ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' symptom management ', ' manage symptom ', ' electronic data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Behavioral ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' cost ', ' health economics ', ' care systems ', ' care services ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' person centered ', ' implementation science ', ' therapy development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' effective intervention ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' pragmatic effectiveness trial ', ' behavioral economics ', ' Data Science ', ' caregiver interventions ', ' Care giver intervention ', ' Pragmatic clinical trial ', ' dementia care ', ' efficacy study ', ' care outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' acceptability and feasibility ', ' implementation efforts ', ' provider behavior ', ' clinician behavior ', ' physician behavior ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,P30,2021,753651,PA-03
"Controlling Quality and Capturing Uncertainty in Advanced Diffusion Weighted MRI PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementia are a growing public health crisis affecting 5.8 million Americans, yet there are only four FDA-approved medications for Alzheimer’s Disease, none of which are disease-modifying. Hence, early detection and diagnosis are key to successful patient management and biomarkers are needed for evaluating new therapies in clinical trials. White matter changes are increasingly implicated in early Alzheimer’s Disease progression, and diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) has been included in many national-scale studies. Yet, quantitative investigation of DW-MRI data is hindered by a lack of consistency due to variation in acquisition protocols, sites, and scanners. DW-MRI enables quantification of brain microstructure and facilitates structural connectivity mapping. Substantial recent progress has been made with calibration and harmonization to reduce inter-subject variance and improve interpretability of computed measures. Yet, the fundamental challenge remains that clinical application of DW-MRI (as currently implemented) is confounded by inter-scanner and inter-site effects. To improve understanding of structural changes in Alzheimer’s Disease, we will construct and evaluate three separate analysis strategies to characterize, calibrate, and optimize DW-MRI for single-subject biomarker development for Alzheimer’s Disease. We will integrate and optimize our strategies using large retrospective multi-site studies and validate the approaches on two distinct prospective cohorts. Specifically, we aim to: Aim 1: Optimize data-driven techniques for stability across sessions, scanners/sites, and field strengths Impact: Harmonized DW-MRI methods will increase sensitivity to Alzheimer’s Disease and its prodromal stages. Aim 2: Translate innovations in microstructural harmonization to structural connectivity (tractography) Impact: Harmonizing structural connectivity will improve understanding of white matter in Alzheimer’s Disease. Aim 3: Advance statistical tools for single-subject inference through normative database construction Impact: Data-driven resources for uncertainty estimation will enable robust single-single subject inference. Relevance and Impact on Healthcare: The proposed research will advance understanding of Alzheimer’s Disease through (1) quantitative harmonization of DW-MRI biomarkers, (2) protocols for harmonization of retrospective and prospective DW-MRI studies, and (3) new tools for single subject inference targeting older cohorts. We will organize workshops/challenges to maximize the translational impact on clinical science. The long-term goal of our research is to (1) provide a well-validated strategy to quantitatively evaluate DW-MRI data across sites, (2) enhance DW-MRI biomarkers for Alzheimer’s Disease, and (3) advance patient care. Our research strategy will transform the manner in which DW-MRI data are interpreted and enable single-subject machine learning to interpret brain properties. The resources, software, and visualization tools will be made freely available in open source through DIPY to facilitate continued innovation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer’s Disease is a significant public health concern, and identifying opportunities for early intervention is critical to developing effective interventional strategies. Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW- MRI) has shown that subtle changes in cerebral white matter are prognostic for disease progression, but quantitative interpretation of these measures in existing large studies is confounded by protocol, scanner, and site effects. This study will translate recent advances in harmonization of DW-MRI to improve specificity of white matter microarchitecture metrics (aim 1), translate connectivity analyses (aim 2) for existing large Alzheimer’s Disease neuroimaging studies, and enable robust single subject inference for abnormality detection and prognosis (aim 3).",Controlling Quality and Capturing Uncertainty in Advanced Diffusion Weighted MRI,10316671,R01EB017230,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Calibration ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition Disorders ', ' cognitive disease ', ' cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive syndrome ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dissection ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Histology ', ' Maps ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Specificity ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Measures ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Normal Range ', ' Normal Values ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Ensure ', ' Chemicals ', ' Evaluation ', ' prognostic ', ' Individual ', ' Cerebrum ', ' cerebral ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' American ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Modality ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' in vivo ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Tissue Model ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' virtual ', ' Visualization software ', ' visualization tool ', ' prospective ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' open source ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' aging brain ', ' aged brain ', ' white matter change ', ' effective intervention ', ' FDA approved ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' biomarker development ', ' virtual biopsy ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' tractography ', ' magnetic resonance imaging biomarker ', ' MRI biomarker ', ' translational impact ', ' imaging study ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' Alzheimer’s disease biomarker ', "" Alzheimer's biomarker "", "" Alzheimer's disease biological marker "", ' Alzheimer’s biological marker ', "" Alzheimer's disease diagnosis "", "" Alzheimer's diagnosis "", ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NIBIB,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,665123,TN-05
"The Network for Investigation of Delirium: Unifying Scientists (NIDUS)'s 9th-13th Annual Delirium Boot Camps: A Foundation for Future Exploration Delirium is a serious cognitive disorder associated with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) that affects ~2.6 million older adults yearly. It is a frequent complication of acute illness, surgery and, now, of COVID-19 infection in older adults. Recognizing the relative dearth of delirium research, the National Institute for Aging (NIA) supported the establishment of the Network for Investigation of Delirium: Unifying Scientists (NIDUS), a collaborative interdisciplinary group of 28 investigators, from 27 institutions, to advance delirium research and develop network infrastructure. This included the creation of an annual “NIDUS bootcamp” conference, to bring together the growing national- and international delirium research community for networking and education. The bootcamp aims are to advance the science of the field and to provide junior investigators with intensive mentorship, through mock NIH application reviews, clinical and research lectures, breakout sessions, and post-bootcamp networking. Bootcamp alumni are provided guidance on: 1) using the NIDUS Delirium Research Hub, Measurement resources and Bibliography, 2) submitting proposals to the NIDUS Pilot Program (13 one-year $50,000 grants awarded), NIA GEMSSTAR/CLINSTAR, the Alzheimer’s Association, and other foundations, 3) attending Mentoring webinars, 4) participating in Junior Faculty Working Groups, and 5) submitting research abstracts to the American Delirium Society (ADS) Annual Meeting. As PIs, 94 alumni have received 46 grants, of which 18 (40%) were NIH-funded, and published 265 original peer- reviewed articles. NIDUS has jumpstarted the careers of many young investigators, particularly bootcamp alumni, enabling them to launch independent programs in delirium research. The goal of this application is to support continuation of a yearly, themed Delirium Bootcamp Conference (DBC), to ensure that the progress of this active research community is sustained. The first-year theme will be the inter-relationship between delirium and ADRD. The Specific Aims are to: (1) Engage and support junior investigators in delirium research through mentorship and access to the NIDUS resources/network (2) Boost the researchers’ funding success (3) Facilitate publication of delirium research and provide ongoing mentorship, and (4) Facilitate networking among junior, mid-career, and senior researchers during and after DBC. As the pool of delirium investigators expands, there is a critical need for a conference focused on addressing cutting-edge research methods in all areas of delirium research, including the relationship with ADRD, “-Omics” research, machine learning and big data, innovations in randomized trials, animal models and mechanistic research, and clinical practice improvement. The DBC will provide an unparalleled opportunity to advance cutting-edge delirium research through interactive didactic sessions and in-depth guidance on complex and nuanced research methods essential for the highest caliber and most impactful delirium research. Delirium is a serious, yet understudied, cognitive disorder that affects millions of elder Americans, and is closely related to Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). The NIA-supported (2015-2020) Network for Investigation of Delirium Unifying Scientists (NIDUS), a collaborative international network of delirium investigators, developed a successful, annual “NIDUS Bootcamp” conference, laying the foundation for this proposal. The new Delirium Bootcamp (DBC) will convene junior investigators and senior faculty in an annual conference with innovations including: 1) a new thematic focus each year, with the 2021 theme highlighting ADRD; 2) focus on high-impact, state-of-the-art methodologies to advance the field in new directions; 3) finding optimal methods to address the unique challenges of delirium research, and 4) developing collaborative interdisciplinary papers to be initiated at the DBC and completed in ongoing groups; thus, fostering the training, career development and success of the next generation of delirium investigators.",The Network for Investigation of Delirium: Unifying Scientists (NIDUS)'s 9th-13th Annual Delirium Boot Camps: A Foundation for Future Exploration,10237513,R13AG072860,"['Acute Disease ', ' acute disease/disorder ', ' acute disorder ', ' Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Bibliography ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cognition ', ' Cognition Disorders ', ' cognitive disease ', ' cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive syndrome ', ' Communities ', ' Complication ', ' Delirium ', ' delirious ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' health care expenditure ', ' healthcare expenditure ', ' Faculty ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Laboratories ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Paper ', ' Peer Review ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Science ', ' Societies ', ' Writing ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Fostering ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Monoclonal Antibody R24 ', ' MoAb R24 ', ' R-24 Monoclonal Antibody ', ' R24 ', ' Collaborations ', ' Community Networks ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' lectures ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' meetings ', ' American ', ' success ', ' transdisciplinary collaboration ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Reporting ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Institution ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Address ', ' International ', ' Study Section ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' working group ', ' work group ', ' systematic review ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' National Institute of Aging ', ' cost ', ' neglect ', ' next generation ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' skill acquisition ', ' skill development ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' patient population ', ' clinical practice ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' senior faculty ', ' full professor ', ' support network ', ' webinar ', ' Network Infrastructure ', ' secondary analysis ', ' Infrastructure ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' COVID-19 ', ' COVID19 ', ' CV-19 ', ' CV19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' SARS-CoV-2 infection ', ' COVID-19 infection ', ' COVID19 infection ', ' SARS-CoV2 infection ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 infection ', ' infected with COVID-19 ', ' infected with COVID19 ', ' infected with SARS-CoV-2 ', ' infected with SARS-CoV2 ', ' infected with coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ', ' ']",NIA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R13,2021,50000,NC-04
"When dementia caregiving ends: The role of patient-caregiver social connection in caregivers' health and well-being PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Dementia and other neurodegenerative diseases lead to profound cognitive, emotional, and functional impairments. As these diseases progress, the person with dementia (PWD) becomes increasingly dependent on a caregiver for functional, psychological, and economic assistance. It is well-documented that caring for a PWD is associated with considerable declines in health and well-being. Evidence suggests that many caregivers continue to experience these adverse effects for years after caregiving has ended (after the death of the PWD), though this area has received less attention. There is also striking variability in the extent to which caregivers experience these consequences – both during caregiving and after it has ended. Research on the sources of these individual differences has largely focused on factors related to the external environment, the PWD, or the caregiver that contribute to increased vulnerability in caregivers. Although research has linked PWD-caregiver relationship quality with declines in caregiver well-being, little is known about the specific interpersonal mechanisms that contribute to caregiver outcomes. For example, the positive emotional qualities of the PWD-caregiver social connection may buffer against the negative effects of caregiving stress, whereas lower quality social connection may drive increases in caregivers’ loneliness. In the proposed research, I will measure PWD-caregiver social connection through observational measures derived from basic affective science, including dyadic coding of emotional behavior in a laboratory-based interaction between PWDs and caregivers (Study 1; N = 186) and text analysis of emotional language caregivers used when describing a recent time they felt connected to the PWD (Study 2; N = 533). I will then determine the impact of PWD-caregiver social connection on caregivers’ health and well-being (Aim 1), both concurrently (in current caregivers) and longitudinally (in former caregivers, after caregiving has ended). Additionally, I will compare the relative strength of these associations between current and former caregivers, and I will investigate possible mechanisms (e.g., loneliness) through which PWD-caregiver social connection is linked to caregivers’ health and well-being. I will then evaluate the predictive value of PWD-caregiver social connection on caregivers’ health and well-being, above and beyond an optimal set of predictors identified through machine learning (Aim 2). The proposed dissertation research will prepare me to conduct future studies investigating the socioemotional mechanisms that may influence caregivers’ health trajectories. This F31 will provide the necessary support to accomplish the following research goals: (1) to further expertise in basic affective science methodologies (e.g., dyadic behavioral coding, text analysis); (2) to achieve advanced proficiency in statistical techniques for longitudinal and machine learning analyses; and (3) to enhance knowledge of neurodegenerative disease, including neuropsychology and differential diagnosis. PROJECT NARRATIVE Dementia and other neurodegenerative disease are progressive, debilitating illnesses that require assistance from loved ones serving as caregivers. Caring for a person with dementia is associated with significantly heightened risk for adverse consequences, such as reduced health and well-being, which may persist for years after caregiving has ended. Identifying mechanisms that convey risk for the long-term adverse effects of caregiving can facilitate developing more effective interventions with major public health benefits.",When dementia caregiving ends: The role of patient-caregiver social connection in caregivers' health and well-being,10235400,F31AG072891,"['Accounting ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Attention ', ' Buffers ', ' California ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Differential Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Laboratories ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Loneliness ', ' lonely ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Persons ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' social ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Progressive Disease ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Cognitive ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Text ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' caregiving ', ' care giving ', ' resilience ', ' positive emotional state ', ' positive emotion ', ' Outcome ', ' care giving burden ', ' caregiving burden ', ' caregiving stress ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Impairment ', ' Affective ', ' loved ones ', ' effective intervention ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' emotional behavior ', ' Caregiver well-being ', ' care giver well-being ', ' care giver wellbeing ', ' caregiver wellbeing ', ' Dementia caregivers ', ' dementia care giver ', ' dementia caregiving ', ' social relationships ', ' emotional functioning ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F31,2021,46036,CA-13
"Prototype Multimedia ADRD Falls Prevention System for Family Caregivers ABSTRACT Falls are a common and expensive problem, especially in persons with cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (PwADRD). Fall costs are expected to reach $67.7 billion this year and add to family caregiver (CG) burden. Injurious falls are a frequent reason people are unable to remain at home, resulting in significantly increased care costs to the family and society.  Most FP efforts fail to address understanding fall risks or changing behavior. In response to NIA requests for ‘Care technology to sustain in-home living, preserve function and promote effective communication’, an innovative falls prevention intervention for use by CGs of PwADRD living at home who are classified as at moderate to high fall risk for falls will be developed and tested. Goal: Develop FallScape for Dementia (FS-D), an innovative CG-provided daily treatment utilizing proprietary multimedia and behavioral intervention methods to facilitate communication and encourage FP behaviors that will reduce PwADRD falls.  The rigorous Phase 1 research plan will: a) develop a FS-D prototype that includes CG training software, multimedia and support tools to customize, conduct and review progress in daily CG-provided Mm sessions; b) Perform pilot testing and c) conduct a mixed methods preliminary clinical trial. Specific Aims and milestones/deliverables are: a) Develop prototype; i. Produce multimedia assets; ii. Craft Customization; iii. Artificial Intelligence algorithms; iv. Create CG training/daily administration tools. b) Pilot test prototype. i. Recruit 12 Dyads representing PwD diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, vascular, Lewy- body and Parkinson’s disease dementias. ii. Test CG ease of use and acceptability; iii. Examine customization for CG and dementia sub-types; iv. Evaluate relevance and dyad engagement. c) Conduct Preliminary Clinical Trial. 1. Recruit and enroll 25 Dyads; 2. Provide study components: initial; one-month FS-D intervention and a Follow-up; 3. Follow Dyads for 6 months; 4. Analyze outcomes and disseminate results.  FS-D will offer a rare opportunity to empower both CG and PwADRD by breaking the frustrating cycle of failure to recognize fall threats or change behavior and may mitigate CG burden. FS-D is an urgently needed falls prevention intervention for family CG use. The economic and quality of life benefits of sustaining in-home living for PwADRD by preventing falls will accrue to all stakeholders for this large, high-risk population. Falls are a common and expensive problem, especially in persons with Alzheimer’s disease and related Dementias (PwADRD) and the family caregiver (CG) is uniquely positioned to provide a positive daily interaction with the PwADRD in order to improve recognition of personal fall risks, encourage falls prevention behaviors and reduce falls. The proposed product FallScape- Dementia will develop and test a system for daily CG use in which Artificial Intelligence algorithms will guide the CG and customize the daily sessions. Reduction of falls will help the PwADRD to remain at home, reducing family and public health costs.",Prototype Multimedia ADRD Falls Prevention System for Family

"Longitudinal validation of cerebral small vessel disease biomarkers in diverse community-based older adults without dementia ABSTRACT Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) encompasses a range of common processes and pathologies (arteriolosclerosis, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, small vessel atherosclerosis, small and microscopic infarcts and bleeds, enlarged perivascular spaces, and white matter disease) that we and others have shown are associated with impaired cognition and dementia (VCID). High-quality biomarkers of SVD are critically needed to advance the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of small vessel VCID. The mission of the MarkVCID consortium has been to identify the most promising biomarkers of SVD and conduct analytical (instrumental) validation and preliminary clinical validation. Our team at Rush University Medical Center and Illinois Institute of Technology was privileged to be active participants in this initial work. We are now eager to continue this collaborative effort with this proposal. The objective of the proposed project is to conduct rigorous longitudinal clinical validation of MarkVCID-selected biomarkers in a diverse cohort free of dementia, and to investigate the associations of these biomarkers with SVD neuropathologic indices, working synergistically with other consortium sites and contributing scientific expertise, experimental infrastructure, and scientific guidance. Specifically, we propose to recruit, enroll, and longitudinally assess a large, diverse, community-based group of older adults without dementia using MarkVCID clinical evaluation and biomarkers, to test the hypotheses that the biomarkers are associated with cognitive decline and SVD neuropathologic indices. This will be a nested sub-study of participants of the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP), Minority Aging Research Study (MARS), Religious Orders Study (ROS), Clinical Core (CC), and Latino Core (LATC) of the Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center, which are on-going longitudinal, clinical-pathologic cohort studies of aging that recruit non-demented individuals and have high follow-up rates. MARS and CC recruit exclusively African Americans, and LATC recruits Latino older adults. Our past contributions to MarkVCID support our current aims. First, we demonstrated our ability to recruit and follow a large and diverse group of non-demented older adults, some of whom died, enabling autopsy studies. Second, we developed and made publicly available a novel biomarker of arteriolosclerosis with high performance, named ARTS, which we trained using machine learning on MRI and pathology data. Third, we contributed to the analytical and initial clinical validation of multiple MarkVCID biomarkers. Fourth, we led the MarkVCID imaging biomarkers committee and were active in all functions of the consortium. We propose to leverage our expertise and infrastructure to conduct rigorous longitudinal clinical validation of MarkVCID biomarkers in a diverse population, and to investigate the associations of these biomarkers with SVD neuropathologic indices. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of the proposed project is to conduct rigorous longitudinal clinical validation of MarkVCID-selected biomarkers in a diverse cohort free of dementia, and to investigate the associations of these biomarkers with SVD neuropathologic indices, working synergistically with other consortium sites and contributing scientific expertise, experimental infrastructure, and scientific guidance.

"Diversity Supplement to Using a Natural Experiment to Evaluate the Long-Term Effects of Neighborhood Deprivation on Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Risk Factors ABSTRACT  The NIA has called for social science and community-based studies to clarify risk and protective factors for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD), particularly among racial minorities who are disproportionately affected. Place, including both neighborhood of residence and region/state of birth, has consistently been correlated with ADRD, stroke, and impaired cognitive function. Yet it is unclear whether modifiable mechanisms explain this association, or whether the association is merely due to the selection of unhealthy individuals into poor regions. The goal of this study is to produce the first quasi-experimental evidence to understand the influence of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation on ADRD and its vascular risk factors. We take advantage of a unique natural experiment, overcoming methodological challenges in the previous literature on neighborhood effects on ADRD. From 1986 to 1998, the Danish government actively dispersed roughly 76,000 incoming refugees across the country in a nearly randomized (“quasi-random”) fashion to avoid over-crowding in major cities. This cohort includes nearly 12,000 individuals who lived until at least age 60 in Denmark during the 30-year follow-up. Over 90% of families agreed to participate in the program, creating a natural experiment in which these individuals were quasi-randomly assigned to neighborhoods with different levels of deprivation. We will employ unique data spanning over 30 years from Denmark’s population and clinical registers, which provide data on sociodemographics, clinical encounters, and prescriptions for all Danish residents. We identify cases of ADRD and its vascular risk factors among this racially diverse cohort via validated techniques using ICD codes and prescription data in clinical registers. We have successfully linked these registers to detailed geocoded data sources on eight measures of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation. In Aim 1, our goal is to test the hypothesis that neighborhood deprivation increases the incidence of ADRD and mortality later in life. In Aim 2, we will examine the effects of neighborhood deprivation on vascular risk factors for ADRD, including highly prevalent conditions that occur across the life course. In Aim 3, we will identify vulnerable subgroups whose development of ADRD and vascular risk factors differs in response to neighborhood deprivation, taking advantage of the large sample size and complete register data available on all subjects. We will employ both hypothesis-driven and hypothesis- generating statistical techniques, including innovative machine learning methods that allow for more complex and robust subgroup identification. This will enable future interventions to be tailored to the most vulnerable individuals. Overall, the expected outcome of this research is to produce rigorous evidence on the effects of neighborhood characteristics on ADRD and vascular risk factors, overcoming the methodological challenges in previous work. This will directly inform the development of clinical, community, and policy strategies to address the neighborhood determinants of ADRD among vulnerable populations who are most at-risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The goal of this research is to examine the effects of neighborhood deprivation on Alzheimer's dementia and its vascular risk factors. We will examine the association of specific neighborhood characteristics with Alzheimer's and its risk factors, and we will assess whether specific subgroups may be more vulnerable to neighborhood deprivation. This will inform the development of interventions to address the neighborhood factors that affect Alzheimer's disease.",Diversity Supplement to Using a Natural Experiment to Evaluate the Long-Term

"Combining information from multiple circadian activity rhythm metrics to optimally detect mild cognitive impairment using a consumer wearable Abstract: Widely-scalable methods for the earlier detection of elevated Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementia (ADRD) would enable earlier intervention and can help reduce/delay disease incidence. Consumer wearable technologies that passively gather “big data” signals could be leveraged to detect the early signs of elevated ADRD risk (see NOT-AG-20-017), in a relatively inexpensive and scalable fashion. One promising set of signals that can be captured by consumer wearable devices, but are currently only assessed in research settings, reflects the Circadian Activity Rhythm (CAR). Human activity follows a predictable 24-hour pattern known as the CAR. Various CAR characteristics are disrupted in ADRDs, reflect ADRD biomarkers levels (even in the pre-clinical stage), and predict future cognitive decline. However, observational studies have yet to conclusively demonstrate which CAR measure(s) best signal early-stage ADRD processes, and could help with early risk stratification. Previous studies have used subsets of the available CAR metrics to establish associations, rather than leveraging multiple metrics to improve ADRD risk prediction. We propose that using a comprehensive panel of CAR metrics could identify combinations of CAR metrics that are sensitive to ADRD risk. Furthermore, we propose that the translation of research findings into clinical screening has been difficult because CAR measurement relies on researcher-, rather than clinic-/user-, friendly systems. To fill these gaps, we propose leveraging consumer wearables, existing data, sleep/circadian science, and machine learning. Our overarching goal is to evaluate evidence for a path forward, from observing associations, towards clinically useful ADRD risk detection with consumer wearables. Our team includes experts in sleep/CAR-related health risks (Dr. Smagula, PI); neuropsychology and activity in aging (Dr. Gujral, co-I); and time series analytics/statistical learning (Dr. Krafty, co-I). We partnered with leaders of major cohorts (see letters of support) that provide the initial data. Aim 1 will compute a comprehensive panel of CAR measures in a sample of 766 adults aged 50+; then use machine learning to develop algorithms leveraging CAR measures to predict the likelihood of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI; a diagnostic marker of elevated ADRD risk). Aim 2 will use a new testing sample (n=25 with and n=25 without MCI) to validate if applying this algorithm to data from a consumer-wearable accurately detects MCI. Dr. Smagula already developed a working prototype measuring CARs using the Apple Watch called the Circadian Activity Profiling System. This R21 can have impact on the field of ADRD risk detection by producing: evidence regarding which CAR metrics best signal MCI; an initial algorithm that combines information regarding CARs to passively detect the likelihood of MCI; and by refining our system for collecting these signals on a popular consumer wearable (the Apple Watch). We will also develop collaborations with additional cohorts so that, if we find evidence supporting potential clinical utility of this approach, we will be prepared to develop a definitive algorithm in an R01 using data from multiple studies. Project narrative: Evidence shows that circadian rest-activity rhythm (CAR) disruption correlates with dementia biomarkers in the pre-clinical phase, and predicts increased likelihood of future dementia incidence. Using archival data and consumer wearables, this project will develop and test a widely-scalable system to identify individuals who have elevated dementia risk by virtue of their CAR profile. Deliverables are an initial predictive algorithm, partnerships with additional sources of archival data for future work, and initial validation that this approach can discriminate between older adults with and without early signs of increased dementia risk.",Combining information from multiple circadian activity rhythm metrics to optimally detect mild cognitive impairment using a consumer wearable,10300129,R21AG074094,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human Activities ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Methods ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Sleep ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Fractals ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cognitive function ', ' Hour ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Cognitive ', ' Exploratory/Developmental Grant for Diagnostic Cancer Imaging ', ' R21 Award ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' systematic review ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' user-friendly ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' high reward ', ' primary outcome ', ' routine care ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' screening ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos ', ' HCHS/SOL Study ', ' HCHS/SOL cohort ', ' diagnostic biomarker ', ' diagnostic marker ', ' Accelerometer ', ' accelerometry ', ' activity monitor ', ' activity tracker ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' recruit ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' modifiable behavior ', ' Apple watch ', ' applewatch ', ' circadian ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' dementia risk ', ' risk factor for dementia ', ' risk for dementia ', ' statistical learning ', ' archive data ', ' archiving data ', ' archived data ', ' glymphatic clearance ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2021,245140,PA-18
"Bioinformatics Strategies for Genome-Wide Association Studies One promise of precision medicine for Alzheimer’s disease is to edit a patient’s DNA and/or administer therapeutics targeting etiologic molecules that prevent or reverse the disease process using a tailored design. All of this happens at the level of the individual and requires precision knowledge of that patient’s biology. In stark contrast, much of the knowledge we possess about genomic risk factors comes from statistical measures of association in subjects ascertained with and without Alzheimer’s. The conceptual and practical disconnect between the populations we study and the individuals we want to treat is a major source of confusion about how to move forward in an era driven by genome technology. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop novel informatics methodology and software to facilitate precision medicine for Alzheimer’s by connecting population and individual genomic phenomena. We propose here a Virtual Genomic Medicine (VGMed) workbench where clinicians can carry out thought experiments about the treatment of individual Alzheimer’s patients using models of disease risk derived from population-level studies. This will be accomplished by first developing a novel Genomics-guided Automated Machine Learning (GAML) algorithm for deriving risk models from real data that is accessible to Alzheimer’s clinicians (AIM 1). We will then develop a novel simulation approach that is able to generate artificial Alzheimer’s data that preserves the distribution of genetic effects observed in the real data while maintaining other characteristics such as genotype frequencies (AIM 2). This will generate open data allowing anyone to perform virtual interventions on Alzheimer’s patients derived from a population-level risk distribution. The workbench will allow editing of individual genotypes and simulate the administration of drugs by editing machine learning parameters in the simulation model (AIM 3). The change in risk and Alzheimer’s disease status for the specific patient will be tracked in real time. Finally, we provide a feature in the workbench that will allow the Alzheimer’s clinician to generate specific hypotheses about individual genetic variants that can then be validated using integrated Alzheimer’s knowledge sources that include databases such as PubMed and ClinVar thus giving the user immediate feedback (AIM 4). All methods and software will be provided as open-source to the Alzheimer’s disease research community (AIM 5). Most genetic studies of Alzheimer’s disease result in statistical summaries of risk derived from human populations. These statistical summaries are not that helpful for determining the health of an individual. This proposal will create new computer algorithms and software help Alzheimer’s clinicians and researchers connect population-level statistics with individual level genetic effects to advance our understanding of how to treat Alzheimer’s patients based on their own unique genetic makeup.",Bioinformatics Strategies for Genome-Wide Association Studies,10284977,R01LM010098,"[""Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Biology ', ' Communities ', ' Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Feedback ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Source ', ' Informatics ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' population-based study ', ' population-level study ', ' studies of populations ', ' study of the population ', ' Population Study ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' PubMed ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' genome wide association study ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' virtual ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' open source ', ' therapeutic target ', ' Algorithmic Software ', ' Algorithmic Tools ', ' Software Algorithm ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' genetic makeup ', ' genetic make-up ', ' Genetic study ', ' Genomic medicine ', ' open data ', ' open science ', ' open-source data ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' data preservation ', ' ClinVar ', "" Alzheimer's disease patient "", "" Alzheimer's patient "", ' virtual intervention ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,391879,PA-03
"The Caregiver Resource Room: Enhancing Support for Caregivers of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT With nearly 6 million cases of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) diagnosed in the United States in 2019, the health and well-being of ADRD caregivers is of critical importance. Promoting the health and well-being of ADRD caregivers is an effective way to support these unpaid staples of ADRD care. Although interventions targeting ADRD caregivers continues to accelerate, little attention has been paid to caregivers’ use of supportive services, which remains strikingly low. The objective of this K99/R00 application is to enable Dr. Falzarano to develop the necessary expertise to design, implement, and evaluate studies focused on leveraging technology to support and address ADRD caregivers’ multifarious needs. In the K99 phase, Dr. Falzarano will work toward achieving five training objectives that will prepare her to transition to become an independent investigator who designs and evaluates evidence-based technologies to enhance tailored caregiver support. First, she will extend her knowledge in substantive areas including dementia caregiving and front-end and back-end software development. Second, she will learn how to develop, implement, and test behavioral interventions with an emphasis on collaboration with community partners. Third, she will receive training in statistical methods to examine feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Fourth, she will learn about measurement development and psychometric validation of assessments for ADRD caregivers. Fifth, Dr. Falzarano will pursue professional development activities, particularly in the areas of grant writing, leadership, and integration of research and web development teams. The four proposed research aims were chosen to complement the areas identified for career development. Aim 1a will provide the requisite training and experiences to provide Dr. Falzarano with the critical skills needed to conduct the proposed study. Aim 1b will include interviews with ADRD caregivers to identify needs, awareness of, barriers to, and willingness to use services. Aim 1c will leverage key stakeholder (dementia-care experts) input to identify existing services corresponding to areas of need identified in Aim 1b. Aim 2 will leverage data collected from caregivers and stakeholders to inform the iterative development and design of the Caregiver Resource Room (CRR) website, which will include a digital self-assessment tool using machine learning models to identify and categorize needs and provide an output of targeted service recommendations. Aim 3 will include an analysis of the tool’s content, design, features, and services output, which will be iteratively refined based on ADRD caregiver feedback. A randomized controlled trial will be conducted in Aim 4 to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the CRR as a tool to enhance awareness of and access to relevant services to address unmet needs and improve mental health. The proposed research is well-aligned with the NIA’s strategic initiative to foster the development of research scientists in aging and to develop and test promising interventions to improve ADRD caregiver outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The multifarious needs of ADRD caregivers often remain unaddressed, and the utilization rate of supportive services remains strikingly low, with many caregivers uncertain about what services may be right for them, what exists, and how to access them. There is a need for a robust, reliable tool that comprehensively evaluates ADRD caregiver needs with a mechanism to connect needs with existing services, thereby overcoming barriers that ADRD caregivers face in accessing needed supportive care. The proposed project seeks to iteratively develop and test an online self-assessment and tailored referral platform, grounded in machine learning principles and informed by stakeholder perspectives, to address needs and enhance knowledge and use of relevant services, with the overall goal of linking ADRD caregivers with relevant support and thereby promoting their mental health and well-being.",The Caregiver Resource Room: Enhancing Support for Caregivers of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD),10284406,K99AG073509,"['Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anxiety ', ' Attention

"Optimizing Atrial Fibrillation Management in CKD ABSTRACT Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia, currently affecting >33.5 million adults world- wide. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is also highly prevalent and affects 14% of the U.S. and North American population. The burden of AF is 3-fold higher in CKD and affects up to 25% of CKD patients. AF is strongly associated with risk of ischemic stroke and death; and these risks are even higher in patients with CKD. Even in the absence of clinical ischemic stroke, some studies have suggested that AF is also associated with excess risks of all dementia types, including Alzheimer’s and vascular dementia, although definitive evidence is lacking. Alzheimer's disease is characterized by neurodegenerative changes in the brain, including amyloid depositions and neurofibrillary tangles. It is plausible that AF may lead to cerebral microinfarcts, cerebral hemorrhage and reduced cerebral blood flow, all which could promote Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias. Gaining a greater understanding of the association of AF with Alzheimer’s and other dementias is particularly important in the CKD population, in whom the incidence and prevalence of dementia is even higher compared with the general population; and in whom the cause of dementia remains elusive and thus largely untreated. Currently, data on the risk of dementia in patients with CKD and AF are limited and may provide new insight into the mechanisms that contribute to dementia in CKD patients. Further, data on whether treatment of AF mitigates risk of dementia are conflicting in all populations (regardless of CKD status). While there are some existing studies of treatment of AF and risk of dementia, most have limitations, including (1) a primary focus on anticoagulation and not a comprehensive evaluation of other AF therapies; (2) inclusion of selected populations and none with CKD; and (3) inadequate consideration of interim clinical measures that may affect receipt and outcomes of AF therapies. Therefore, the effects of successful treatment of AF on risk of dementia remains largely unknown. Further data could identify novel therapeutic approaches for the prevention and treatment of dementia. We propose to efficiently leverage our unique research platform that includes “real-world” contemporary data to evaluate the risk of dementia in patients with AF, with and without CKD; as well as determine whether successful treatment of AF with a comprehensive range of therapies is linked to a lower risk of dementia. To conduct this work, we will perform a rigorous comparative effectiveness analysis of >500,000 patients with and without AF from two participating health care systems in California. This proposed supplemental project will yield key insights to understanding the link between AF and dementia; particularly in the high-risk population of those with CKD.

"An AI-assisted screening platform within a multivariate framework for biomarkers of mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease PROJECT SUMMARY Accumulating evidence indicates that every 65 seconds, someone develops Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the United States, and over 5.7 million Americans have the condition. Alzheimer's and other dementias will cost the nation $277 Billion by 2050. The major problem is that many people with cognitive impairment (CI) may not know they have it because dementia is underdiagnosed and underreported. There is a lack of low-cost and non- invasive screening instruments to identify individuals at risk for CI with high accuracy automatically. Therefore, considering the global and societal implications of the dementia epidemic, better strategies are needed to identify patients at risk for dementia. An eye health evaluation offers a unique perspective on the health of our eyes and our bodies. For example, visual observation of the retina as a diagnostic modality is already widely used to detect high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, and even brain tumors since a physician can see the optic nerve, which is part of the brain. Thus, an eye test may also be a potential solution to detect CI. While early manifestations of numerous risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease) have been found in the human retina, they may confound the first signs of CI. In healthcare, the complexity and rise in data volume have contributed to the remarkable worldwide interest of Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications in medicine. Therefore, we aim to provide a practical near-term risk assessment of CI through AI, by identifying and utilizing novel multivariate biomarkers (including eye markers) with a better discrimination power. In this Phase I STTR, iScreen 2 Prevent, LLC, the University of Miami, and the iCareHub, LLC, will develop an AI-based screening platform for early detection of CI due to AD. Our preliminary data show that multivariate eye biomarkers are related to cognitive status and can be used to discriminate mild CI patients from cognitively healthy subjects (age-matched (55+ years old), area under the receiving operating curve (AUROC)=0.90 (SE=0.050), p<0.001). However, multivariate biomarkers need to be combined at the point of screening to enhance the accuracy of predictions, and biomarker methodologies could be advanced using AI. We aim to integrate and optimize our eye screening framework (iScreen 2 Predict™) into a digital health platform (iCAREHub) that collects personalized, comprehensive clinical data at the point of care. We also aim to develop an AI-based model with the integrated multivariate markers and test the iScreen 2 Predict™ software's ability to discriminate patients with mild CI due to AD. This project fills a critical technology gap in the field of AD diagnostics. While the number of screening tools using unimodal and expensive biomarkers continues to grow, these tools do not consider multivariate data generated during the routine care in a collective and automated way. Thus, their diagnostic potential is limited. The development of our software as a medical device (SaMD) for detecting CI due to AD earlier, considering multifactorial variables and relevant biomarkers of ocular-brain abnormalities related to cognitive status, will allow earlier intervention and facilitate better management of the disease's primary cognitive symptoms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia among older people. Unfortunately, current diagnostic technologies are limited because they predict cognitive impairment too late and cannot capture various risk or protective factors, increasing healthcare spending. In this project, we aim to develop iScreen 2 Predict™, an AI- based diagnostic platform for predicting persons at risk of AD in primary and community health care settings.",An AI-assisted screening

"Continuing Tool Development for Longitudinal Network Analysis: Enriching the Diagnostic Power of Disease-Specific Connectomic Biomarkers by Deep Graph Learning Project Summary/Abstract A plethora of neuroscience studies shows mounting evidence that neurodegenerative diseases manifest distinct network dysfunction patterns much earlier prior to the onset of clinical symptoms. Since the subject-specific longitudinal network changes are more relevant to the neuropathological process than topological patterns derived from cross-sectional data, recognizing the subtle and dynamic longitudinal network biomarkers from noisy network data is of great demand to enhance the sensitivity and specificity of computer-assisted diagnosis in neurodegenerative diseases. However, current popular statistical inference or machine learning approaches used for neuroimages (in a regular data structure such as grid and lattice) are not fully optimized for the learning task on brain network data which is often encoded in a high dimensional graph (an irregular and non-linear data structure). Such gross adaption is partially responsible for the lack of reliable biomarkers that can be used to predict cognitive decline in routine clinical practice. To address this challenge, we aim to (1) develop a novel GNN (graph neural network) based learning framework to hierarchically discover the multi-scale network biomarkers that can recognize the disease-relevant network alterations over time, and (2) examine the diagnostic power of the new network biomarkers derived from our GNN-based machine learning engine across neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and frontotemporal dementia. The success of this project will allow us to integrate the novel GNN-based learning component into our current longitudinal network analysis toolbox and release the AI (artificial intelligence) based network analysis software to the neuroscience and neuroimaging community. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to continue the tool development of longitudinal network analysis for neurodegenerative diseases with the focus on the machine learning component. To do so, we will first develop the GNN (graph neural network) based learning framework to discover the multi-scale network biomarkers from the population of brain network data. After examining the diagnostic value of the network biomarkers discovered by our learning- based method across neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and frontotemporal dementia, we will integrate the machine learning component into our current longitudinal network analysis software and release to the neuroscience and neuroimaging community.",Continuing Tool Development for Longitudinal Network Analysis: Enriching the Diagnostic Power of Disease-Specific Connectomic Biomarkers by Deep Graph Learning,10109509,R03AG070701,"[""Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communities ', ' Computer-Assisted Diagnosis ', ' Computer aided diagnosis ', ' computer-assisted diagnostics ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Evolution ', ' Goals ', ' Industry ', ' Learning ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Supervision ', ' Syndrome ', ' Time ', ' Neurofibrillary Tangles ', ' neurofibrillary degeneration ', ' neurofibrillary lesion ', ' neurofibrillary pathology ', ' tangle ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' Label ', ' Clinical ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Amyloid Plaques ', ' Neuritic Plaques ', ' amyloid beta plaque ', ' amyloid-b plaque ', ' aβ plaques ', ' cored plaque ', ' diffuse plaque ', ' Senile Plaques ', ' tool ', ' Frontal Temporal Dementia ', ' front temporal dementia ', ' frontal lobe dementia ', ' fronto-temporal dementia ', ' fronto-temporal lobar dementia ', ' frontotemporal lobar dementia ', ' frontotemporal lobe degeneration associated with dementia ', ' Frontotemporal Dementia ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Source Code ', ' comparison group ', ' comparator group ', ' collaboratory ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' network dysfunction ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' data structure ', ' Network-based ', ' tool development ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' clinical practice ', ' high dimensionality ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', "" Alzheimer's disease diagnosis "", "" Alzheimer's diagnosis "", ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NIA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R03,2021,158733,NC-04
"Exploration of MRI measures of neurodegeneration within individuals over short intervals PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY  Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia affect over five million Americans. Alzheimer's disease begins with changes in the brain more than a decade before the disease can be diagnosed from memory and cognitive impairment in a clinic. The goal of this work is to provide a way to measure early signs of neurodegeneration in individual people. The historical barrier to measure change in individuals is that each person's brain is different with change accumulating too slowly to be picked over short intervals. As a result, most research focuses on tracking averaged subject groups or tracking change over multiple years. The present work optimizes new brain imaging techniques using MRI to make extremely fast, highly precise repeated measurements of brain regions all within the same individual. The work then seeks to use the novel imaging approach to measure neurodegeneration in individuals with early stages of Alzheimer's disease in six months or less and also differentiate changes in people with Alzheimer's disease from less common forms of dementia that have distinct anatomical changes in the brain. If successful, the present work will provide a new means to track the early stages of neurodegeneration as would be used in clinical trials and translational medical research. NARRATIVE  The proposed research explores the possibility of precisely estimating change in specific brain structures in individuals at early stages of neurodegeneration. Anchoring from recent developments in fast brain scanning techniques, we use a novel methodological approach that permits a tremendous increase in the precision of measuring change within a single person by repeatedly, safety, and efficiently scanning the brain over time. Demonstrating successful precision measurement within the individual will open opportunities to track therapeutic effects in small samples during early phases of development as well as allow for individualized estimates of neurodegeneration to be made dynamically within the same person. !",Exploration of MRI measures of neurodegeneration within individuals over short intervals,10140263,R01AG067420,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Base Sequence ', ' Nucleotide Sequence ', ' nucleic acid sequence ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' Joints ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Persons ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Pathology ', ' Research ', ' Safety ', ' Semantics ', ' Unmarried person ', ' Maritally Unattached ', ' Single Person ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Amyloid beta-Protein ', ' Alzheimer beta-Protein ', "" Alzheimer's Amyloid beta-Protein "", "" Alzheimer's amyloid "", "" Amyloid Alzheimer's Dementia Amyloid Protein "", ' Amyloid Beta-Peptide ', ' Amyloid Protein A4 ', ' Amyloid β ', ' Amyloid β-Peptide ', ' Amyloid β-Protein ', ' Aβ ', ' a beta peptide ', ' abeta ', ' amyloid beta ', ' amyloid-b protein ', ' beta amyloid fibril ', ' soluble amyloid precursor protein ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' Medical Research ', ' tau Proteins ', ' MT-bound tau ', ' microtubule bound tau ', ' microtubule-bound tau ', ' tau ', ' tau factor ', ' τ Proteins ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' morphometry ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' cerebral atrophy ', ' brain atrophy ', ' cortical atrophy ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Primary Progressive Aphasia ', ' Mesulam Syndrome ', ' Atrophy ', ' Atrophic ', ' tool ', ' Progressive Aphasias ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Stream ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' American ', ' Brain scan ', ' Proxy ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' time interval ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI Scans ', ' brain volume ', ' Brain region ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' cognitive change ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Monitor ', ' Therapeutic Effect ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' hippocampal atrophy ', ' hippocampal atropy ', ' normal aging ', ' therapeutic development ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' safety testing ', ' rate of change ', ' secondary analysis ', ' clinical translation ', ' imaging approach ', ' imaging based approach ', ' amnestic mild cognitive impairment ', ' ']",NIA,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,598015,MA-05
"Computerized assessment of linguistic indicators of lucidity in Alzheimer's Disease dementia Project Summary The focus of the parent project (AG069792) is to enable automated detection and analysis of episodes of unexpected lucidity in individuals with late-stage dementia in which the individual long thought to have succumbed to dementia and lost most of his or her cognitive abilities temporarily regains the ability to communicate in a clear and coherent fashion. Towards this goal, this project aims to develop a) technology for automatic conversion of speech produced by patients with dementia to text and b) measures of semantic coherence from the transcribed text. The development of this technology relies on state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods including deep learning and time series analysis. We are currently developing these approaches using existing datasets including the Carolina Conversations Corpus (CCC), Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS) and Dementia Bank (DB) which contain audio and text transcripts of conversational interviews with patients with dementia of varying severity and healthy controls. Currently, the researchers in the AI/ML community use these resources by following individually developed pre-processing procedures that are partially described in publications resulting from their work and ad hoc code made available in multiple repositories. The results obtained by various investigators can be difficult to compare because of individual differences in how the data were processed and prepared for ML experimentation. For the one-year supplement project, we propose to create an open-source platform consisting of tools that will ingest original data available from DB, WLS, and CCC datasets and convert them to be AI/ML-ready in keeping with the current best practices in the AI/ML community. This project seeks to develop a validated tool approach to automatically monitoring people with advanced dementia who are thought to have lost their cognitive abilities for potential episodes in which they unexpectedly and temporarily regain their ability to communicate coherently. We propose to develop and evaluate a system to record the speech produced in advanced dementia, convert it to text and measure the degree of coherence of the language produced with the intention to identify atypically lucid episodes.",Computerized assessment of linguistic indicators of lucidity in Alzheimer's Disease dementia,10412501,R21AG069792,"[""Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Award ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Forensic Medicine ', ' Forensics ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Methods ', ' Noise ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Semantics ', ' Speech ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' repaired ', ' repair ', ' Ingestion ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Severities ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' tech development ', ' technology development ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Time Series Analysis ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Documentation ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' Transcript ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' computerized ', ' Individual Differences ', ' interoperability ', ' open source ', ' advanced dementia ', ' demographics ', ' parent project ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive ability ', ' learning community ', ' diagnostic biomarker ', ' diagnostic marker ', ' FAIR principles ', ' FAIR data ', ' FAIR guiding principles ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable ', ' deep learning ', ' heterogenous data ', ' data heterogeneity ', ' data set heterogeneity ', ' dataset heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous data ', ' heterogeneous data sets ', ' heterogeneous datasets ', ' heterogenous data sets ', ' heterogenous datasets ', ' data interoperability ', ' data reuse ', ' data re-use ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' open source tool ', ' open source toolkit ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R21,2021,228530,MN-05
"AURA-ALZ: Connecting Audio and Radio Sensing Systems to Improve Care at Home for Persons with Early Alzheimer's Disease Or Related Dementias And Their Caregivers AURA-ALZ: Connecting Audio and Radio Sensing Systems to Improve Care at Home for Persons with Early Alzheimer's Disease Or Related Dementias And Their Caregivers ABSTRACT In response to NOT-AG-20-034, the proposed Alzheimer’s-focused supplement will develop Connecting Audio And Radio Sensing Systems To Improve Care At Home for persons with early Alzheimer's disease or related dementias (ADRD) and their caregivers. The research proposed in this supplement aligns with the parent R01 study (R01LM013329). Persons with ADRD and their caregivers routinely confront various complex challenges and experience huge care burden. A common practice in technology-assisted care intervention is to guide patients and family caregivers through web and mobile phone-based training, health-vital monitoring, symptom reporting, and providing feedback and advice. These intervention programs, while have been shown to be effective, have three major demerits. First, a member of the care team (the patient or a family member) has to actively measure and enter patient data into the system, which is error-prone, subjective, and sometimes, forgotten. Second, web or mobile-based interactions can be cumbersome and demanding. Simple tasks like entering data, assessing health status, or getting and responding to an alert require typing and clicking through a series of electronic forms. Third, interactions between the system and the caregiver, especially when the system needs to remind or confirm an intervention, simple notifications and messages on a smartphone/website is often ineffective and unnoticed. To improve technology-based care interventions and to better serve persons with ADRD and their caregivers, the proposed study will adopt a user-centered approach to adapt and extend the AURA system that we have been developing in our ongoing R01. The research aims are: 1) Increase the robustness of the AURA subsystems; 2) Engage stakeholders (persons with early ADRD, caregivers, clinicians) to identify the needs of ADRD care and caregiving to help co-produce AURA-ALZ for persons with early ADRD and their caregivers; 3) Determine the usability, acceptability, and feasibility of AURA-ALZ in 10 persons with early ADRD and caregiver dyads' homes using mixed methods. Our current R01 aims to develop a technology- assisted AURA system for patients who are post-surgical treatment for bladder cancer and their caregivers. AURA passively monitors specific activities of a patient at home using WiFi signals, tailors natural language responses of voice assistants based on the patient's state, and automates entering data into the system to reduce the burden on the caregivers of cancer. AURA communicates with the care team in natural languages for reminders and confirmation of collected information, which is intuitive, handsfree, and less demanding. Building upon AURA, AURA-ALZ will have similar but enhanced features to address the unique care needs of persons with ADRD and caregivers. This study addresses the NLM’s mission of enabling biomedical research, supporting health care and public health, and promoting healthy behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE In the proposed study, we plan to adopt a user-centered approach to develop AURA-ALZ, an extended and adapted version of our innovative eHealth AURA program, to meet the needs of persons with ADRD and their caregivers. Different from previous interventions that focus on counseling, support groups, education, and skills training, AURA-ALZ will provide continuous monitoring of daily activities and gestures using a novel WiFi-based sensing technique, and enable voice-based user interactions, automated reminders, and hands-free surveys for guiding future individualized interventions for persons with early ADRD, which will help reduce caregiver burden, and ultimately, improve the health outcomes of the patients and caregivers.",AURA-ALZ: Connecting Audio and Radio Sensing Systems to Improve Care at Home for

"Agitation in Alzheimer's Disease: Identification and Prediction Using Digital Behavioral Markers and Indoor Environmental Factors PROJECT SUMMARY Agitation is one of the most common and unmanageable neuropsychiatric symptoms experienced by persons with dementia (PWD), affecting 45-83% of this ever-growing population. Agitation brings much stress and detriment to patients and caregivers. Treatment of agitation is often pharmacological intervention which can have adverse side effects. There is a great need for identification of early behavioral warning signs and environmental precipitants of agitation so that it can pave the way for proactive management of agitation and lower the burden on caregivers. The overall goal of this project is to address this critical unmet need through the proposed research and mentored training of the applicant. The Oregon Center for Aging & Technology (ORCATECH), under the direction of Dr. Kaye (proposed primary mentor), has more than a decade of experience developing and deploying a digital behavioral assessment platform in older adults' homes and has the experience analyzing the data collected in the clinical context of older adults. The scientific goals of this proposal are to develop digital behavioral markers that identify episodes of agitation, identify early behavioral warning signs and environmental precipitants of agitation, and build a risk prediction model of episodes of agitation using environmental and behavioral sensors and techniques from machine learning and time series analysis. The applicant will collect behavioral data from 10 study participants with later-stage dementia living in memory care units and 10 study participants with later-stage dementia living at their own homes using passive infrared motion sensors, wearable actigraphy devices, and bed pressure mats and follow them for 2 years. Such behavioral data will be used to identify digital behavioral markers that indicate or predict episodes of agitation. The applicant will also collect environmental data (ambient light level, noise level, temperature, relative humidity, and barometric pressure) from their living environments, and such data will be used to identify environmental precipitants of agitation. In order to conduct the proposed study and prepare for an independent research career, the applicant will be trained through taking courses and attending workshops in the following areas: (1) the different diagnosis and standard of care for PWD, their neuropsychiatric symptoms and their precipitants; (2) methods of using technology in dementia research; (3) novel methods from deep learning and time series analysis for building risk prediction models of agitation; and (4) development of professional skills for conducting successful and ethically responsible clinical research. The proposed team of mentors and consultant each provide expertise in one or more of these areas and are together committed to collaboratively facilitating the applicant's training. The applicant will apply these new skills to the proposed research project and obtain R01 support in order to use the methods for detecting and predicting episode of agitation to create and explore the effectiveness of early interventions for agitation in PWD. Such findings are likely to lead to improve methods for reducing and detecting episodes of agitation and ultimately help protect caregivers' physical and mental health while improving dementia care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Agitation is one of the most common and unmanageable neuropsychiatric symptoms among persons with dementia, affecting 45-83% of this ever-growing population. Pharmacological treatment of agitation often has adverse side effects, and time-constrained caregivers cannot reasonably be expected to monitor the patients and take continuous note of the environment to identify precipitants of agitation. The research and training for this Mentored Quantitative Research Development Award will be centered on identifying digital behavioral markers both during and preceding agitation, identifying environmental precipitants of agitation, and building risk prediction models of agitation using data collected from patients with later-stage dementia and their living environment.",Agitation in Alzheimer's Disease: Identification and Prediction Using Digital Behavioral Markers and Indoor Environmental Factors,10190522,K25AG071841,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Award ', ' Beds ', ' Behavior ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cues ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Environment ', ' Controlled Environment ', ' artificial environment ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Humidity ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' longterm care ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Motor Activity ', ' Locomotor Activity ', ' Persons ', ' Noise ', ' Nursing Records ', ' Oregon ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' pressure ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Residential Treatment ', ' residential care ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Temperature ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Agitation ', ' Psychomotor Agitation ', ' Psychomotor Excitement ', ' Psychomotor Hyperactivity ', ' Psychomotor Restlessness ', ' Restlessness ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' analytical method ', ' career ', ' Label ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' residence ', ' residential building ', ' residential site ', ' barometric pressure ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' burn-out ', ' burnout ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' research study ', ' Time Series Analysis ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' assisted living ', ' assistive living ', ' assistive living facilities ', ' Assisted Living Facilities ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' diagnosis standard ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' actigraph ', ' actigraphy ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Pharmacological Treatment ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Behavior monitoring ', ' behavioral monitoring ', ' digital ', ' Population ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' standard of care ', ' informal care ', ' informal caregiver ', ' Informal care giver ', ' caregiver strain ', ' care giver strain ', ' Formal caregiver ', ' Formal care giver ', ' dementia care ', ' neuropsychiatric symptom ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' intervention cost ', ' sleep quality ', ' quality of sleep ', ' deep learning ', ' aging and technology ', ' risk prediction model ', ' side effect ', ' motion sensor ', ' memory care ', ' poor sleep ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K25,2021,147437,OR-03
"Advanced machine learning algorithms that integrate genomewide, longitudinal MRI and demographic data to predict future cognitive decline toward dementia ABSTRACT The “preclinical” phase of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by abnormal levels of brain amyloid accumulation in the absence of major symptoms, can last decades, and potentially holds the key to successful therapeutic strategies. Today there is an urgent need for quantitative biomarkers and genetic tests that can predict clinical progression at the individual level. This project will develop cutting edge machine learning algorithms that will mine high dimensional, multi-modal, and longitudinal data to derive models that yield individual-level clinical predictions in the context of dementia. The developed prognostic models will specifically utilize ubiquitous and affordable data types: structural brain MRI scans, saliva or blood-derived genome-wide sequence data, and demographic variables (age, education, and sex). Prior research has demonstrated that all these variables are strongly associated with clinical decline to dementia, however to date we have no model that can harvest all the predictive information embedded in these high dimensional data. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used to compute clinical predictions from high- dimensional biomedical data such as clinical scans. Yet, most prior ML methods were developed for applications where the ``prediction’’ task was about concurrent condition (e.g., discriminate cases and controls); and established risk factors (e.g., age), multiple modalities (e.g., genotype and images) and longitudinal data were not fully exploited. This application’s core innovation will be to develop rigorous, flexible, and practical ML methods that can fully exploit multi-modal, longitudinal, and high- dimensional biomedical data to compute prognostic clinical predictions. The proposed project will build on the PI’s strong background in computational modeling and analysis of large-scale biomedical data. We will employ an innovative Bayesian ML framework that offers the flexibility to handle and exploit real-life longitudinal and multi-modal data. We hypothesize that the developed models will be more useful than alternative benchmarks for identifying preclinical individuals who are at heightened risk of imminent clinical decline. We will use a statistically rigorous approach for discovery, cross-validation, and benchmarking the developed tools. This project will yield freely distributed, documented, and validated software and models for predicting future clinical progression based on whole-genome, longitudinal structural MRI and demographic data. We believe the algorithms and software we develop will yield invaluable tools for stratifying preclinical AD subjects in drug trials, optimizing future therapies, and minimizing the risk of adverse effects. NARRATIVE Emerging technologies allow us to identify clinically healthy subjects harboring Alzheimer’s pathology. While many of these preclinical individuals progress to dementia, sometimes quite quickly, others remain asymptomatic for decades. The proposed project will develop sophisticated data mining algorithms to derive models that can predict future clinical decline based on ubiquitous, easy- to-collect, and affordable data modalities: brain MRI scans, saliva or blood- derived whole-genome sequences, and clinical and demographic variables.","Advanced machine learning algorithms that integrate genomewide, longitudinal MRI and

"Compensation Training and Lifestyle Modifications to promote healthy aging in persons at risk for Alzheimer's disease: a digital application supported intervention The prevalence of Alzheimer's Disease and other disorders (ADRDs) is now a public health crisis. In the absence of effective medical treatment, there is a critical need for behavioral interventions to prevent or delay symptom onset. Multidomain interventions simultaneously targeting multiple modifiable risks for ADRD have shown promise, but additional innovative approaches that could be highly accessible by capitalizing on user- friendly digital applications to support and strengthen behavior modification are needed. Training in the use of compensatory aids (e.g., calendars and note taking systems) can improve daily independence. These same compensatory tools can be employed to facilitate the adoption of lifestyle changes that support brain health (e.g., exercise, cognitive engagement, stress management) through management of goal-setting, behavioral monitoring, tracking and feedback. The current project will test a 6-month intervention that provides training in both compensatory aids and lifestyle modification. A comprehensive suite of digital tools encapsulated in the Digital Memory Notebook (DMN), an easy to use, interactive application, will be used to facilitate behavioral change and enhance participant motivation. Further, the DMN allows collection of real-time data to track intervention adherence. The DMN has been successfully applied to improving compensation among individuals with mild cognitive impairment. The proposed work capitalizes on a critical window for building resilience by targeting individuals at risk for ADRD due to a subjective cognitive concern (SCC) but who remain cognitively normal. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) among ethnoracially diverse older adults with SCC to compare our digital app supported compensation training and lifestyle modification intervention to an education only control group that will not use the DMN or be provided with guidance on how to implement the educational material into their daily lives. Specific aims of the project include: 1) evaluate intervention efficacy on primary outcomes (global cognition and everyday function); secondary outcomes focus on well-being, cognitive domains (memory and executive function), activities of daily living (IADLs), physical function, compensation, and health behaviors; 2) evaluate characteristics of treatment responders; 3) evaluate adherence and identify the effective components of the target intervention using a mixed-method approach; and 4) design machine learning algorithms that use patterns of change in real-time DMN data metrics to identify incipient declines in treatment adherence and changes in health status. The intervention under study is novel because it applies training in compensation to support lifestyle modifications and everyday functioning using a digital app that also monitors adherence to each component of the intervention in real-time. The project is expected to expand understanding of factors that may impact adherence to and outcomes of a preventative intervention leading to optimization of a scalable intervention to reduce dementia risk applicable to diverse populations. There is an urgent need to develop interventions that will delay functional disability and improve the quality of life of our growing aging population. This work is expected to lead to a scalable compensation and lifestyle intervention to improve well-being and delay disability in individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease and other disorders. This research is relevant to public health and NIH's mission as the results are expected to have an important positive impact on caregiver burden, health care costs and the functional independence of

"Design, Development, and Validation of an AI-enabled Legal Planning and Financial Management Training Solution for ADRD Caregivers PROJECT ABSTRACT More than 16 million caregivers (‘family members or friends’) of people with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) face serious challenges in providing care. ADRD caregivers are frequently tasked with substantial and overwhelming legal and financial planning, and they face increased financial risk and strain as a result. Currently, there is no widely available web-based financial and legal training that can be personalized to meet caregivers’ specific needs. During this Fast Track project, we will begin with a deep discovery of legal planning and financial management needs of ADRD caregivers, conduct participatory co- design sessions with diverse caregivers groups, create multimedia training solutions, design an AI-enabled recommender system to match caregivers with the right training content, and then conduct rolling field trials with a diverse groups of caregivers to confirm the feasibility, usability, and acceptability of our legal planning and financial management training solution. Looking ahead to Phase 3, we expect our solution will support financial stability through delivery of personalized and actionable training for estate planning and financial management needs. We anticipate a combination of B2B partnerships and B2C strategies will yield a sustainable revenue model for our caregiver training solution. PROJECT SUMMARY ADRD caregivers face substantial and overwhelming legal and financial planning tasks, which can increase financial strain and emotional stress.

"Development of novel computational protocols to study amyloid oligomerization Project Summary Dr. Viet Man is a biophysicist whose overarching career goal is to prevent the development of neurodegenerative diseases which are associated to the aggregation of amyloid proteins/peptides. He received his Ph.D. degree in physics from Institute of Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences (IFPAN). He completed two postdoctoral fellowships before joining the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences at The University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy (PittPharmacy) as a scientist. The research proposal entitled “Development of Novel Computational Protocols to Study Amyloid Oligomerization” combines Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation integrated innovative system designs and special data analysis, advanced statistical methods and scientific programming development to investigate the oligomerization of amyloid proteins/peptides, to identify inhibitors for the formation of amyloid oligomers, and to establish theoretical bases for physical therapies that target the elimination of the toxic amyloid oligomers. The research proposal includes three aims: 1) investigate the oligomerization of amyloid proteins/peptides; 2) identify inhibitors for the formation of amyloid toxic oligomers from approved drugs and natural compounds; 3) study physical therapies for eliminating the toxic oligomers. The completion of these aims will reveal important insights of the amyloid oligomerization process, provide potential drugs and promising physical therapies for preventing the development of some diseases such as Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer's disease, which are both associated to the amyloid oligomerization. The proposed career development plan is built upon his previous training with four training goals to enhance his trajectory toward becoming an independent investigator: 1) Experiential and didactic learning in experimental methods used for amyloid aggregation; 2) Acquire and apply advanced statistical analyses, machine learning as well as artificial intelligence; 3) Become an expert in force field and scientific program development; and 4) Develop leadership and professional skills to execute multicenter studies. Dr. Man and his primary mentor, Junmei Wang, Ph.D., have assembled a strong team of co-mentors and advisors to guide Dr. Viet through the proposed training and research activities. The proposed career development plan utilizes the intellectual, equipment and data resources available through the PittPharmacy and other schools/centers of the University of Pittsburgh.

"Advancing Drug Repositioning for Alzheimer’s Disease using Real-world Data Project Summary: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD) is the 6th leading cause of death affecting about 5.7 million Americans. Generally, one in five women and one in ten men are expected to develop AD/ADRD; and the number of people living with AD/ADRD is expected to grow to 14 million in the next two decades. The quality of life of AD/ADRD patients is gradually diminished and caring for AD/ADRD patients imposes tremendous emotional and financial burden on family caregivers, communities, and healthcare systems. However, up until now, there is no cure and not even effective treatment for AD/ADRD patients, probably due to the complex mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of AD/ADRD. As drug development is becoming increasingly expensive and time-consuming (with estimated cost from $648 million8 to $2.5 billion9 and an average of 9-12 years for new drugs), drug repurposing, aiming to discover new uses of existing drugs, is one potential solution to speed up the drug development for AD/ADRD. However, previous attempts on drug repurposing for AD/ADRD based on omics data have not been successful so far, indicating that animal models may not translate to humans as readily as hoped. New methods that can speed up drug development for AD/ADRD are needed. In this study, we propose to detect drugs that can be potentially repurposed for AD/ADRD using 4 unique EHR data sets. This study will address the critical challenges of EHR-based drug repurposing including incomplete patient’s information and misclassification error associated bias. Aim 1 will focus on a drug repurposing knowledgebase for AD/ADRD, natural language processing methods to extract risk factors from clinical narratives, and phenotyping algorithms to accurately identify MCI and AD/ADRD patients to support the patient cohort construction. In Aim 2, we will develop drug repurposing methods that account for the high-dimensional of risk factors and misclassification error associated bias and apply them to detect drug repurposing signals using large collections of EHRs from (1) the OneFlorida network (2) the Cerner Health Facts database, (3) EHR from physician practice at University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, and (4) EHR data from the University of Pennsylvania. In Aim 3, we propose to validate the top-ranked signals through a prospective cohort study. We will recruit patients and routinely collect detailed pragmatic information and genotypes to validate the efficacy of the identified drug signals. The success of our study will: (1) produce a knowledgebase with timely updated risk factors, biomarkers, genotypes, and drug signals for AD/ADRD, (2) develop an open- source drug repurposing package - RAIDER (Repurposing Alzheimer Impacting Drugs using Electronic health Records) for AD/ADRD, and (3) generate drug repurposing signals validated in a prospective cohort study, which will inform the design of future large-scale national trials for AD/ADRD.

"Using Machine Learning to Improve Readmission Prediction in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia Project Summary/Abstract By 2060, approximately 14 million adults are expected to live with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD). Although ADRD patients represent 10% of the general geriatric population, they account for 37% of the direct healthcare expenditures. Compared to other older adults, ADRD patients are at a significantly higher risk of hospitalization and unplanned 30-day hospital readmission (hereafter “readmission”). Readmissions are costly and expose ADRD patients to expedited cognitive decline, premature institutionalization, and death. Availability of a caregiver after hospital discharge is critical for ADRD patients to ensure adherence to diet, medications, and follow-up appointments. There is a paucity of evidence examining readmission among the ADRD population. Most risk-assessment tools (e.g. LACE Index) have poor discrimination power and lack inclusion of influential medical and social features, and caregiver availability particular to ADRD patients. A potential solution is to develop a risk tool using hospitals’ electronic health records (EHRs) because they contain salient clinical and sociodemographic features as well as a wealth of information from physicians’, nurses’ and social workers’ notes (unstructured EHRs data). The specific research aims for this proposal are to (1) develop and validate a risk-assessment tool for predicting readmission among ADRD patients; (2) examine the feasibility/acceptability and clinical/economic utility of the readmission risk- assessment tool; and (3) develop a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm to extract information on caregiver availability from unstructured EHRs (exploratory). We hypothesize that the predictive power of our risk tool will be at least 20% higher than that of LACE Index (the current risk tool used in the Michigan Medicine hospitals). To accomplish this project, my mentors and I have defined a set of targeted career goals and educational training. My training aims include (1) gain familiarity with the clinical aspects of ADRD (linked with Research Aim 1); (2) acquire methodological skills in machine learning and predictive modeling (linked with Research Aim 1); (3) develop an understanding of the logistics of the ADRD patient discharge and care transition processes (linked with Research Aim 2); and (4) gain proficiency in NLP and algorithm validation (linked with Research Aim 3). By completion of this award, I will have used EHRs and data science to develop a validated risk-assessment tool for readmission for hospitalized ADRD patients. The results will enable efficient and targeted discharge planning to reduce readmission and wasteful spending. It will also provide pilot data needed to apply for an R01 examining the optimization of discharge process/location for hospitalized ADRD patients. This career development award will lay the foundation for me to become a unique health economist specialized in efficient care transitions for ADRD patients. Narrative Patients with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD) are at higher risk of hospitalization and 30-day readmission (readmission) compared to other older adults. Readmission is expensive and increases the risk of institutionalization and premature death among ADRD patients. The main goal of this proposal is to use Michigan Medicine’s electronic health records to develop a tool to identify high-risk ADRD patients.",Using Machine Learning to Improve Readmission Prediction in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia,10263307,K01AG068361,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', ' Appointment ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Award ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Discharge Plannings ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Economics ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' health care expenditure ', ' healthcare expenditure ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' indexing ', ' Influentials ', ' Institutionalization ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Michigan ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Patient Discharge ', ' Discharge from Health Care Facility ', ' Discharge from Healthcare Facility ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Social Workers ', ' Stress ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Caring ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Logistics ', ' Medical History ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' frailty ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' Familiarity ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' skills ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' social ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Predictive Value ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' electronic structure ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' health data ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Data Science ', ' predictive tools ', ' readmission risk ', ' re-admission risk ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' unstructured data ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2021,130140,MI-12
"Mobile app delivered Mentalizing Imagery Therapy to augment remote family dementia caregiver skills training: a pilot randomized, controlled trial with outcomes assessment using digital phenotyping Over 15 million Americans serve as family caregivers of relatives with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD- Related Dementias (ADRD), and this often subjects them to tremendous stress, resulting in poorer mental health and higher risk of physical illness. Due to emotional and physical exhaustion, lack of time, and immediate needs related to caring for their loved ones, caregivers often forego their own self-care. The National Institute on Aging Strategic Plan identifies the need to develop better interventions to improve the mental and physical health of caregivers as a crucial priority area. The purpose of this Paul B. Beeson K76 Emerging Leaders Career Development Award in Aging Research application is to support the research training of Dr. Felipe Jain, a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Jain’s work aims to improve caregiver skills training delivered remotely by smartphone with guided imagery and mindfulness therapies that reduce stress and help the caregiver improve mentalizing (understanding the links between mind and behavior) of themselves, their loved one suffering from dementia and others in their social milieu. Further, Dr. Jain hopes to develop the skills in machine learning and data science necessary to estimate early changes in caregiver symptoms remotely and passively, without any additional effort on the part of the caregiver who is often already overwhelmed, using smartphone sensors that capture information about caregiver behaviors.  In the conduct of this K76 award, Dr. Jain will lead a randomized, controlled trial for 120 AD/ADRD caregivers 60 years of age or older. Caregivers will be assigned to receive smartphone applications that either include a caregiver skills toolbox alone, or a caregiver skills toolbox combined with Mentalizing Imagery Therapy (MIT). MIT uses guided imagery and mindfulness to help caregivers improve stress, reduce negative mood and increase mentalizing. Theoretically, stress reduction resulting from MIT due both to mindfulness skills and better mentalizing of the care recipient and others should help caregivers better implement tools for caregiving within their unique social environment and accounting for the care recipient’s individual symptoms.  The first aim of the study is to determine the clinical effects of App-delivered caregiver skills with or without MIT on caregivers’ perceived stress, caregiver burden, mastery, depression and insomnia. The second aim is to develop behavioral markers from smartphone sensors that are associated with outcomes. We will (1) test the hypothesis that smartphone estimated sleep is longitudinally associated with caregivers’ self-reported insomnia, stress and burden and (2) determine the feasibility of identifying behavioral features with machine learning to predict day-to-day sleep and stress. If successful, this research will help open a new avenue of AD/ADRD caregiver research and treatment focused on improving mentalizing. It will also inform the field of aging research regarding the feasibility of using smartphone sensors to detect changes in early behavioral markers that may be used by clinicians to intervene for older adults at risk of poor outcomes. Project Narrative The proposed research will promote the public health of more than 15 million Americans who serve as family caregivers for relatives with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. It will assess whether stress reduction therapy incorporating guided imagery practices that promote perspective taking and empathy can improve the effects of family caregiver skills training delivered remotely by smartphone. It will also test the feasibility of using smartphone estimated markers to track caregiver insomnia and stress, which could eventually help reduce caregiver suffering and healthcare costs by identifying early warning signs of treatment failure and symptomatic worsening.","Mobile app delivered Mentalizing Imagery Therapy to augment remote family dementia caregiver skills training: a pilot

"Smartphone phenotype collection for diagnostic screening of mild cognitive impairment PROJECT SUMMARY In this Phase II SBIR project, Parabon NanoLabs will complete the development, validation and commercialization of CTX, a revolutionary smartphone- and tablet-based cognitive testing platform for collection and analysis of measurements of cognitive performance (“phenotypes”). Traditionally, cognitive assessments are performed in a clinic using either simple surveys that assess only some aspects of cognition or expensive, single-purpose equipment such as eye tracking stations. Such testing lacks the frequency and precision needed to detect subtle early changes that signal the onset of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or early-symptomatic dementia. Instead, CTX will take full advantage of mobile sensors (e.g., audio, video, touchscreen, and motion) to enable in-depth cognitive testing anytime, anywhere. Regular use of CTX will allow a clearer picture of each user's cognitive abilities to emerge, enabling early detection of subtle changes. CTX is not intended to replace neurologists but instead to extend their reach by allowing regular, widespread screening for improved disease detection and patient monitoring. The long-range goal of CTX is to allow aging adults to monitor and manage their cognitive health more effectively and to provide pre-symptomatic indicators of pending dementia to patients and their clinicians, thus enabling early intervention and planning. After a highly successful Phase I project, CTX already enables rapid development of mobile tests that can capture raw sensor streams in a synchronized fashion and transmit them to a cloud server for subsequent analysis and reporting. Sophisticated analytics pipelines have been developed to convert these sensor streams into cognitive phenotypes (e.g., extracting eye movement data from selfie video taken during a cognitive test). Using the CTX framework, the Parabon team has already developed an Apple® iOS® mobile app with proof-of-principle tests for assessing verbal recall, eye movement, motor function, and episodic memory. In Phase II, we propose to develop two new suites of CTX tests for one-time cognitive impairment screening and cognitive performance monitoring, as well as phenotype extraction pipelines for each. We will evaluate tests in normal and affected cohorts to determine usability, user retention and whether resulting phenotypes enable accurate cognitive assessments by clinicians. Our specific aims are to (1) Develop new and engaging cognitive tests and pipelines for assessing visual search and targeting, expressive and receptive language, motor movement and episodic memory; (2) Validate measures in cognitively normal and impaired cohorts; and (3) Analyze and prepare data for publication and premarket submissions to the FDA. PROJECT NARRATIVE According to the World Health Organization, the number of people living with dementia is expected to triple from 50 million to 152 million by 2050. Existing pen-and-paper cognitive tests used for dementia screening were designed to detect overt disease, but early detection of cognitive decline is needed for proper intervention and planning. In this project, we are developing a smartphone- and tablet-based set of highly accurate tests that can be used for one-time cognitive impairment screening and game-like activities for ongoing cognitive health monitoring.",Smartphone phenotype collection for diagnostic screening of mild cognitive impairment,10255750,R44AG062072,"['Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the

"Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy and Subsequent Risk of Vascular Dementia, Alzheimer's Disease, or Related Dementia: A Retrospective Cohort Study Taking into Account Mid-Life Mediating Factors. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Karen Schliep, a tenure-line Assistant Professor of Public Health at the University of Utah. Dr. Schliep is establishing herself as a young investigator in women’s life-course epidemiology, specifically in a novel area of aging research—to improve our understanding of women’s increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias (RD) and create women-specific interventions to mitigate risk and improve outcomes. This award will allow Dr. Schliep to achieve her goal of research independence by providing her support to accomplish the following training aims: 1) develop expertise in biomedical informatics and population-based research methods; 2) gain experience in the conduction of clinical cognitive health assessments; 3) enhance knowledge of modifiable factors affecting women’s mid- and late-life cognitive health; and 4) expand skills to independently lead and manage a successful research program. Dr. Schliep has assembled a mentoring team comprising a primary mentor, Dr. Michael Varner, an obstetrician and nationally renowned maternal-fetal medicine investigator with expertise in pregnancy complications including hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), and two co-mentors: Dr. Norman Foster, a cognitive neurologist and geriatric neurologist and recognized leader in dementia research, and Dr. Ken Smith, an internationally known expert in population-based analyses and genetic/family epidemiology. Dr. Schliep has five advisors with expertise in classification modeling, ADRD neuropsychology, mid-life women’s health, longitudinal and survival data analysis, and chronic disease epidemiology.  Little is known regarding the association between HDP, estimated to complicate 2–8% of all pregnancies, and long-term adverse maternal neurological outcomes with similar inflammatory vascular etiologies, including ADRD. An estimated 5.4 million Americans currently suffer from ADRD, two-thirds of whom are women. As the US aging population increases, prevalence of dementia is expected to approach 13.2 to 16.0 million cases by 2050. Why ADRD disproportionately affects women is not known. Dr. Schliep’s research objective is to develop classification models for the various dementia subtypes (including AD, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia) to analyze longitudinal, individual-level data to better understand how HDP may increase a woman’s risk for ADRD. Dr. Schliep will accomplish this through the following research aims: 1) increase accuracy of ADRD diagnoses within health administrative databases; and 2) investigate the association between HDP and ADRD, and mid-life mediating factors. The proposal’s expected outcomes include 1) a novel method to accurately capture dementia cases within large linked health administrative databases; 2) clarity on how HDP may be linked with specific dementia subtypes; and 3) skills, experience, and preliminary data for Dr. Schliep to support future studies identifying other sex-specific risk factors for dementia and mediating factors amenable to interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Women have a two-fold higher lifetime risk for Alzheimer Disease (AD), vascular dementia, and related dementias (RD) compared to men. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including preeclampsia, eclampsia, and gestational hypertension, may contribute to sex differences in ADRD, with midlife experiences such as depression influencing the magnitude of risk. We propose to 1) create a model that can identify AD and related dementias in a large health administrative database; and 2) test the link (and mediating factors) between hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and ADRD, which will serve as the first step towards creating women’s tailored intervention that can mitigate ADRD risk for women.","Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy and Subsequent Risk

"The Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) Project: Promoting Adherence to Enhance the Early Detection and Treatment of Cognitive Decline Many older adults experience declines in cognitive ability that can be substantial, including mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease and AD-related dementia. Population aging, coupled with age-related cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, represents an unprecedented challenge. Early detection of cognitive impairment is a crucial goal. This would allow individuals at risk for mild cognitive impairment and/or AD/ADRD to adopt lifestyle changes to minimize decrements and the risk for acquired cognitive impairment. However, the massive potential of cognitive training and longitudinal assessment to detect and prevent age-related cognitive impairment and dementia are unlikely to be realized unless individuals are willing and able to engage with these protocols for an extended period of time. Adherence to cognitive assessment and training is often poor. Addressing the gap between potential and realized benefits of early detection and prevention of cognitive impairment is an urgent goal as the population ages. The aims of the Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) project are to promote early detection and treatment of age-related cognitive impairment and dementia by 1) enhancing adherence to cognitive intervention and assessment protocols, 2) improving understanding of barriers to long-term adherence, and 3) assisting in the development of algorithms for predicting and preventing adherence failures. Projects aim to investigate these issues within samples of older adults with and without cognitive impairment. Two randomized controlled trials will test an adaptive, tailored, and integrated technology support system predicted to boost adherence to cognitive protocols, over and above a simpler scheduling and reminder system over 6 months. Studies will provide valuable and generalizable insight into not only the benefits of adherence support, but also the individual difference factors that shape protocol adherence (e.g., attitudes, cognitive ability, dementia status, health status, personality, technology proficiency). Data will inform the process of identifying individuals who would benefit from additional support, and predicting and preventing extended adherence failures before they happen. By increasing adherence, these studies will help improve early detection and treatment of cognitive impairment, which will ultimately extend older adults' functional independence, improving their lives and the lives of their families, and reducing care and support resources needed to address lost independence like that associated with Alzheimer’s disease and AD-related dementia. Further, intervention studies for dementia and Alzheimer’s disease can be made more efficient through tools for identifying individuals likely to experience decline before substantial cognitive impairment has occurred. Results have implications that extend far beyond cognitive impairment; the methods and mechanisms uncovered have broad implications for technology-mediated assessment and protocols to enhance health and well-being in general. The project consists of two large randomized controlled trials and smaller needs assessment and usability studies that will guide their development and deployment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aims of the Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) project are to promote early detection and treatment of age-related cognitive impairment and dementia. This project will develop Artificial Intelligence-based reminder systems to help ensure long-term engagement to home-based cognitive assessment and cognitive training protocols to be able to detect and treat cognitive impairment as soon as possible.",The Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) Project: Promoting Adherence to Enhance the Early Detection and Treatment of Cognitive Decline,10134189,R01AG064529,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Attitude ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Interview ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Methods ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Personality ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Reminder Systems ', ' Mediating ', ' Schedule ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Age-associated cognitive decline ', ' Age-related cognitive decline ', ' Benign senescent forgetfulness ', ' age associated memory decline ', ' age related cognitive deficit ', ' age related cognitive impairment ', ' age related memory dysfunction ', ' Age-associated memory impairment ', ' Adopted ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' preference ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Social Support System ', ' Support System ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' cognitive change ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cognitive training ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Population ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Coupled ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' person centered ', ' usability ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' aging population ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' public health relevance ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive performance ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive ability ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile technology ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' functional independence ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' behavioral adherence ', ' behavior adherence ', ' algorithm development ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIA,FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,654065,FL-05
"Validation of Biomarkers of Small Vessel Injury in VCID This proposal is in response to RFA-NS-21-005, which is a continuation of RFA-NS-16-020. The overall goal of the project is to study the impact of vascular disease on Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Small vessel disease is the major vascular disease associated with dementia. Cerebral small vessel diseases such as arteriolosclerosis and cerebral amyloid angiopathy are independently associated with worse cognitive performance and greater likelihood of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). MarkVCID1 consortium shared subject clinical neuropsychological test data, MRI results and biological samples to validate the biomarkers. The NIH identified 11 biomarkers from MarkVCID1 that could be used in future clinical trials. The UNM site made major contributions to both the MRI and fluid biomarkers: UNM and UCD led the work on the Free Water (FW) biomarker, and contributed data to all of the other MRI biomarkers. UNM was one of the few centers that collected cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and matched blood on all subjects, contributing to all of the fluid biomarkers selected to move into MarkVCID2. Our group contributed CSF and blood samples to multiple sites for validation of the angiogenic and inflammatory biomarker kits, including CSF placental growth factor (PlGF), and blood exosomes and endothelial inflammation kits. We used MesoScale Discovery assays for fluid analysis, and have recently purchased a Quanterix HD-X single molecule assay (SIMOA) instrument that we will use it to measure neurofilament light (NfL) and PlGF. The UNM Specific aims are: 1) to continue to lead to development of the FW biomarker kit in collaboration with UCD to make this trial ready and to add imaging data to the other MRI biomarkers kits; 2) to continue to collect CSF and blood samples to contribute to the validation of all the CSF and blood biomarker kits; and 3) to recruit 200 new underrepresented patients over two years to add to legacy subjects. UMN anticipates to have longitudinal data for 3 years on many participants. UNM has a large number of patients with VCID, AD, and mixed dementias, as well as subjective cognitive complaints that have been studied as part of two RO1 grants (2006-2016) and the MarkVCID1 (2016- present) with data on clinical cognitive test results, MRI, CSF, and blood. Many of these patients have longitudinal data from multiple follow-ups. UNM is committed to achieving the goals and milestones laid out by NIH for MarkVCID2, and to contribute to the completion of the evaluation of the biomarkers that will be used with study-ready cohorts for clinical trials in vascular cognitive impairment. Narrative During MarkVCID1, the 7-center consortium developed a series of biomarkers of which NIH selected 11 for further testing in MarkVCID2. UNM was the leader with UCD for the Free Water MRI kit, which will be biologically validated and studied longitudinally. In MarkVCID2, UNM will continue to validate all of the other MRI biomarkers and to provide data to support all of the fluid biomarkers that are advancing; we will recruit 200 diverse patients over 2 years as well as continue assessments of our MarkVCID1 cohort to include in the study-ready population.",Validation of Biomarkers of Small Vessel Injury in VCID,10369502,UF1NS100598,"[""Alzheimer's

"Longitudinal predictive modeling for tau in Alzheimer's disease PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease, the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, is characterized by a cognitively asymptomatic preclinical stage which is identified and monitored via longitudinal tracking of pathophysiological biomarkers, e.g., tau and amyloid. Since the aggregation of tau protein tangles in the medial temporal lobe is a key driver of memory impairment, accurate image-based longitudinal prediction of tau burden could fill a critical gap in biomarker development for preclinical Alzheimer’s disease. Tau tangles exhibit stereotypical neuroanatomical patterns of spatiotemporal spread that correlate strongly with the progression of neurodegeneration. Studies in animal models have suggested that the characteristic patterns of tau spread associated with Alzheimer’s progression are determined by neural connectivity rather than physical proximity between different brain regions. Graph-theoretic methods that utilize macroscale structural connectivity mapping in humans to predict future tau burden could lead to valuable prognostic tools for Alzheimer’s disease. The overarching research goal of this R01 Research Project Grant is to develop an interpretable machine learning model that uses individual structural connectomics to make personalized predictions of differential measures of tau from multimodal baseline data. Our approach relies on longitudinal 18F-Flortaucipir positron emission tomography (PET) for the imaging of tau tangles, 11C-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) for the imaging of amyloid plaques, and high-angular-resolution diffusion magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for individualized structural connectomics in human subjects. We will develop a physics-informed and interpretable graph neural network to predict the annual rate of change of the regional tau burden from multimodal inputs, including baseline tau, Aβ, and an array of structural connectivity metrics. We will also develop novel physics-based analytic models for tau progression, which will be used to effectively guide the machine learning framework. Finally, we will apply the machine learning model to investigate the earliest cortical site of tau aggregation, to examine the connectomic basis of early tau spread, and to leverage our model’s interpretability to discover and validate novel connectomic biomarkers to characterize preclinical Alzheimer’s disease. To validate the machine learning model, we will use serial tau PET data at two and three timepoints from the Harvard Aging Brain Study, one of the largest longitudinal imaging resources for preclinical Alzheimer’s disease. To ensure scientific rigor, secondary validation of the models will be performed using data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. The proposed personalized predictive model could significantly impact preclinical Alzheimer’s prognosis, facilitate ongoing clinical trials, and shed light on the neuroconnectomic and biological underpinnings of Alzheimer’s disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this Research Project Grant is to develop methods for modeling the spread of tau tangles, which are a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease, along the structural network of the brain. Novel artificial intelligence tools will be developed that accurately predict the progression of tau. The proposed imaging techniques are expected to facilitate the prognosis and monitoring of Alzheimer’s disease.",Longitudinal predictive modeling for tau in Alzheimer's

"Guiding next steps for SPRINT-MIND implementation: Identifying high-benefit subgroups and comparative effects of ARB- vs. ACEI-based regimens PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) are the leading cause of dependence and disability in the elderly population worldwide, costing the US healthcare system over $200 billion annually. Because ADRD represents a continuous irreversible physical and cognitive decline, identifying effective approaches for its prevention is imperative. Hypertension, particularly in midlife, is associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline and ADRD. Recent data from the randomized Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) Intervention Trial (SPRINT) Memory and cognition IN Decreased hypertension (SPRINT MIND) demonstrated that intensive SBP control (<120 mmHg) reduced the combined incidence of adjudicated mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and probable dementia, as well as abnormal white matter lesion (WML) volume compared to standard BP control (<140 mmHg) over five years follow up. To maximize public health impact, it is critical to identify which patients derive the greatest cognitive and net (overall) benefit from intensive SBP treatment and if cognitive benefits were due to direct effects of specific antihypertensive medications on cognition independent of, or in addition to, their BP-lowering effect. Prior animal and human studies, as well as our preliminary data, suggest that angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) have greater effects on cognition than angiotensin-converting- enzyme inhibitors (ACEI). If verified, this finding would be significant since ARBs and ACEIs are currently among the medications most commonly prescribed to older adults and are thought to be equivalent in benefit and safety. Our objective is to answer remaining questions of how to safely implement SPRINT in older patients most likely to derive cognitive benefits from intensive SBP treatment. With its large sample size, 5 years follow-up, and high-quality repeated measures of rigorously adjudicated cognitive outcomes, brain imaging, and antihypertensive medication use, SPRINT MIND provides a unique, cost-efficient, and ideal setting to answer these questions. We aim to: (1) develop and validate a prediction tool that quantifies patients’ expected cognitive benefits and net (overall) benefit incorporating cognitive and cardiovascular benefit and risk of SAEs under intensive SBP treatment, and (2) determine comparative effects, including dose-response, of ARB- vs. ACEI-based antihypertensive medication regimens on cognitive and brain structure outcomes independent of SBP-lowering effects. Though SPRINT MIND is among the first randomized trials to demonstrate a beneficial preventive effect on cognition, it is uncertain how SPRINT-MIND should be implemented and in which patients. Successful completion of this project will guide next steps for implementation by determining: (1) which patients derive the greatest cognitive and net (overall) benefit from intensive SBP treatment and (2) if ARBs have greater beneficial effects on cognitive outcomes and WML volume than ACEIs, independent of their similar SBP lowering effects.

"A Longitudinal Examination to Predict Quality of Life and Care Transitions for Persons with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias at End-of-Life ABSTRACT  Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) are a group of progressive, terminal illnesses that will affect an estimated 14-million people in the United States by the year 2050. Caregivers experience chronic stress and they report feeling burdened and unprepared for making difficult end-of-life (EOL) care decisions, which may lead to unnecessary hospitalizations or avoidable transitions in care that affect end-of-life quality-of-life (EOL-QOL). Advance care planning (ACP), which improves EOL-QOL, is the gold-standard approach for improving concordance between preferences and actual care received at EOL. However, despite decades of research aimed at raising their rates, only 50% of those with AD/ADRD have a written ACP. Furthermore, there is a lack of current research evidence investigating the factors associated with transitions in care and EOL-QOL for persons with AD/ADRD, which could help guide EOL decision-making. To date, the state of the science is primarily cross-sectional in nature, and does not account for the influence of trajectories of decline, the effect these changes have on caregivers, nor how longitudinal changes in caregiving ultimately affect EOL care outcomes. Therefore, there is a critical need to discover new approaches for preparing persons with AD/ADRD and their caregivers in making informed, in-the-moment decisions, to ensure high EOL-QOL care and to support appropriate transitions in care as circumstances change over time. Using the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) and National Study on Caregiving (NSOC), we plan to use a machine learning based framework to identify the key determinants for predicting the risk for EOL care transitions and the traits of EOL-QOL among older adults residing in the community. This study has two specific aims: 1) Develop predictive model of factors related to end-of-life care transitions (e.g. inpatient death versus hospice) in persons with AD/ADRD longitudinally; and 2) Develop a predictive model of factors related to end-of-life quality-of-life (EOL-QOL) in persons with AD/ADRD. Discovering knowledge in a large population- level dataset is foundational for the future development of a generalizable/scalable model for guiding persons with AD/ADRD and their caregivers as they navigate a fragmented healthcare system while making difficult decisions for their loved ones. Our approach fills a critical gap between the current approaches for improving EOL-QOL and EOL transitions in care that focus on ACP as a singular outcome, by addressing the comprehensive needs of individuals with AD/ADRD and their caregivers that change over time. Our study will provide a predictive model for EOL-QOL and EOL care transitions. This is a critical first step for the future development of an approach for personalizing care to guide persons with AD/ADRD and their caregivers in making EOL care decisions. These results will have an important positive impact on EOL care, which aligns with the strategic goals of the National Institutes of Aging (NIA) and Nursing Research (NINR) to address clinical and translational gaps in the study of EOL care needs of people with AD/ADRD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) are at high risk for experiencing burdensome care transitions, avoidable hospitalizations, and poor end-of-life quality-of-life (EOL-QOL) due to the increasing prevalence of multiple chronic illness and escalating demands placed on caregivers, resulting in significant personal and public socioeconomic burdens. Decades of research has focused on improving the rates of advance care plans above 50% among persons with AD/ADRD, however, others may benefit more from personalized guidance to help navigate the trajectory of decline that supports timely, “in the moment” medical decision making. This study addresses Goals 2 and 3 of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease to enhance care quality and efficiency and expand support for persons with AD/ADRD by identifying factors related to poor EOL-QOL and care transitions in the context of caregiving for the future development of a personalized approach to support in the moment healthcare decision-making.",A Longitudinal Examination to Predict Quality of Life and Care Transitions for Persons with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias at End-of-Life,10162470,R03AG067159,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Attention ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' hospice environment ', ' Hospices ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Persons ', ' Nursing Research ', ' Patients ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Hospice Care ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Decision Support Model ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' trait ', ' Advance Health Care Planning ', ' Advance Healthcare Planning ', ' Advance Care Planning ', ' phrases ', ' Terminal Illness ', ' terminal decline ', ' Terminal Disease ', ' Time Series Analysis ', ' Reporting ', ' end of life care ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' end-of-life ', ' end of life ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Cognitive ', ' Update ', ' trend ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' National Institute of Aging ', ' caregiving ', ' care giving ', ' inpatient service ', ' inpatient care ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' ethnoracial ', ' person centered ', ' high risk ', ' loved ones ', ' personalized care ', ' Precision care ', ' individualized care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' caregiver strain ', ' care giver strain ', ' personalized approach ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' precision approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' secondary analysis ', ' care outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' ']",NIA,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R03,2021,79750,NY-26
"In-vivo MRI-based prediction of TDP43 pathology in aging ABSTRACT Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43) pathology, a primary protein abnormality in the rare diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration, is now recognized as a common age-related neuropathology, detected at autopsy in approximately 50% of older persons. According to recent evidence, TDP43 pathology in aging is associated with more rapid cognitive decline and higher odds of dementia, above and beyond contributions from Alzheimer’s and other age-related neuropathologies. In spite of its high frequency and deleterious effects, TDP43 can only be diagnosed at autopsy, and there is currently no approach that provides in-vivo accurate information about the presence of TDP43 pathology in aging. The overall goal of the proposed project is to develop and test an in-vivo MRI-based classifier of TDP43 pathology in aging by combining multimodal MRI and pathology in the same older persons from large community cohorts. Specifically, we propose to a) train TDP43 classifiers using machine learning based on ex- vivo MRI measurements of macro-structural, micro-structural and chemical brain characteristics of older persons, b) translate these classifiers in-vivo, and c) test them in-vivo using longitudinal clinical, in-vivo MRI, and pathology data on older adults enrolled without dementia. We have generated a unique ex-vivo and in-vivo multimodal MRI-pathology database within the infrastructure of the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) (R01AG17917) and Religious Orders Study (ROS) (P30AG010161), two longitudinal, epidemiologic clinical- pathologic cohort studies of aging that recruit non-demented individuals and have high follow-up rates and high autopsy rates. Using our database, we have produced compelling preliminary results in support of our aims. First, we have demonstrated that ex-vivo brain MRI data can be linked to in-vivo MRI data. Second, we show that TDP43 pathology is related to specific brain MRI characteristics independent of other age-related pathologies. Third, we show high TDP43 classification performance (AUC=0.81) based on ex-vivo MRI features in persons with as well as without comorbid Alzheimer’s pathology (a common coexisting pathology). Fourth, we demonstrate that the confidence score obtained from ex-vivo MRI classification is linked to the progression of deposition of TDP43 pathology (i.e. TDP43 stages). Finally, we translated a preliminary ex-vivo TDP43 classifier for use in-vivo and demonstrated in a small sample that it has high in-vivo classification performance, and is independently associated with lower cognition. We propose to further develop and test this promising in-vivo MRI classifier of TDP43 pathology in aging. PROJECT NARRATIVE Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43) pathology is now recognized as a common and deleterious age-related neuropathology, however, there is currently no approach that provides in-vivo accurate information about the presence of TDP43 pathology in aging, and diagnosis is only possible at autopsy. The objective of the proposed project is to develop and test an in-vivo MRI-based classifier of TDP43 pathology in older community- dwelling persons with and without dementia, based on a combination of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of macro-structural, micro-structural and chemical characteristics of the brain.

"TRiPOD: Toward Reusable Phenotypes in Observational Data for AD/ADRD - managing definitions and correcting bias Project Summary Large observational data such as electronic health records (EHRs) and medical claims have become an enabling source for facilitating clinical and translational research including Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementia (AD/ADRD). One major challenge for conducting observational AD/ADRD studies is about phenotyping – there is a lack of a centralized repository for hosting and standardizing phenotype definitions in AD/ADRD research and few methods have been developed to address bias associated with phenotyping errors in observation data. Therefore, the overarching goal of this proposal is to fully develop a joint effort between medical informaticians, statisticians, clinicians, and epidemiologists with a focus on building a rigorous set of methods and tools for managing phenotype definitions and for correcting bias in observational data analysis, through modern knowledge engineering and data-driven statistical modeling. To achieve that goal, we propose three specific aims in this study: (1) Aim 1 - Collect, normalize, and share definitions of common phenotypes used in AD/ADRD observational research; (2) Aim 2 - Develop novel algorithms to correct bias associated with phenotyping errors when users apply existing phenotype definitions to local data; and (3) Aim 3 - Validate, refine, and disseminate proposed methods and tools by demonstration studies and community engagement. We believe informatics methods and tools proposed here will improve current practice on phenotypic data management and analysis, thus enhancing the reproducibility and quality of observational studies on AD/ADRD. Project Narrative Observational data, including electronic health records (EHR) and claims data, provide tremendous opportunities for clinical and translational research for Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementia (AD/ADRD).

"Down Syndrome: Toward Optimal Trajectories and Health Equity using Medicaid Analytic eXtract (DS -TO-THE-MAX) PROJECT ABSTRACT Down syndrome (DS), a trisomy of chromosome 21 and the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability, was once a condition in which children would rarely see adulthood. In 1950, the estimated mean life expectancy for a person with DS was 26 years and median age at death was 4 years. With improvements in recognition and treatment of co-occurring conditions of DS, such as congenital heart defects, the estimated median life expectancy in 2010 was 53 years (median age at death was 58). There is now a large and diverse population with DS across all ages who are in dire need of solutions and treatments for medical issues that were inconceivable 60 years ago. Two conditions of high interest that often presage other morbidity, greatly harm quality of life, and lead to premature mortality are obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and dementia. OSA is an episodic sleep-state collapse of the upper airway which results in reduction or lack of ventilation during sleep and is prevalent in more than half of people with DS. The triplication of chromosome 21 in DS is associated with an overproduction of the amyloid precursor protein and is pivotal to the accelerated development of dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Even when not the proximal cause of death, in post-mortem autopsy nearly all older adults with DS have beta amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles that signify Alzheimer's disease. More needs to be known about causes, course, and the impact of social determinants on these conditions and resulting premature mortality, especially as clinical DS samples are often under powered and often lack participants of color. To meet the directives of the National Institutes of Health's Investigation of Co-occurring conditions across the lifespan in Down syndrome project and the National Institute on Aging's priorities we propose to create Down Syndrome: Towards Optimal Trajectories and Health Equity using Medicaid Analytic eXtract (DS-TO-THE-MAX). DS-TO-THE-MAX will identify a retrospective longitudinal cohort of >100,000 adults with DS and >4,000,000 adults without DS from 10 years of Medicaid Analytic eXtract data plus additional Medicare data for dual enrollees. Our innovation lies in a DS sample orders of magnitude larger than past work, a social determinants of health framework, and novel machine learning and quantitative bias analysis methods. We will complete two aims: 1) Assess epidemiology and social determinants of obstructive sleep apnea, dementia, and mortality 2) Use machine learning to identify risk algorithms for obstructive sleep apnea, dementia, and mortality. The results of this project will strengthen the epidemiologic and public health basis for DS research and population level intervention. In building the DS-TO THE MAX cohort and assessing risk, resilience, social determinants we will have a vital big data set to complement clinical research and work toward the population with DS living long, healthy, and self-determined lives. PROJECT NARRATIVE While lifespan has greatly expanded for people with Down syndrome (DS) in the last seventy years, the population still experiences burdensome morbidities and premature mortality.

"Multi-modal functional health assessment and intervention for individuals experiencing cognitive decline PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs) is a challenge our society must address. While the future of healthcare availability and quality of services seems uncertain, at the same time advances in pervasive computing and intelligent embedded systems provides innovative strategies to meet these needs. One particular need which technology can help address is assessment and assistance with a person's functional performance. The long-term goal of this work is to develop technologies that will improve the independent functioning and quality of life of individuals with functional limitations (particularly individuals with ADRDs) and reduce their reliance on caregivers. The primary objective of this application is to develop a multi-modal sensor-based approach to automate functional health assessment and assistance with everyday activities. Building on our prior collaborative work, our approach will be to collect and fuse multi-modal functional performance data from ambient sensors, mobile sensors, free text, and assessment apps (Aim 1). This fused “human behaviorome” will provide a basis, together with observation-based ground truth, for automated functional assessment and validation of each component technology, including the use of compensatory strategies, through in-person observation and through video recording of typical daily activities and strategies (Aim 2). Finally, using iterative, user-centered assessment of prompt-based assistance, we will evaluate the ability of activity segmentation and forecasting techniques to provide automated support for activity initiation and accurate completion of everyday activities (Aim 3). The proposed contributions are significant because they will provide insights on functional health revealed within a person's everyday environment that have not been investigated in prior work. The results can also help to extend functional independence through real-time assistance, while the outcomes can assist family planning, provision of care, and design of real-world and lab-based measures of functional performance. This work is important because of the increasing number of older individuals experiencing cognitive and functional limitations due to chronic health conditions. Furthermore, they address the need for individuals to remain functionally independent as long as possible in their own homes, thereby improving quality of life and reducing health care costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to design and pilot test a multi-modal sensor-based approach to automate functional health assessment and provide assistance with everyday activities for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs). This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings for functional health assessment and intervention. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through technology-assisted health self-management, reduce caregiver burden and improve quality of life.",Multi-modal functional health assessment and intervention for individuals experiencing cognitive decline,10267717,R01AG065218,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Automation ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Family Planning ', ' Family Planning Services ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Sources ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Intelligence ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Public Health ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Video Recording ', ' Videorecording ', ' video recording system ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Self Management ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Services ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' functional status ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Modeling ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' care giver stress ', ' caregiver stress ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' cognitive rehab ', ' cognitive rehabilitation ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Text ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' iterative design ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' Data Analytics ', ' health care availability ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health assessment ', ' smart home ', ' functional independence ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' multimodal data ', ' multi-modal data ', ' multi-modal datasets ', ' multimodal datasets ', ' learning algorithm ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIA,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,603938,WA-05
"A Technology-Driven Intervention to Improve Early Detection and Management of Cognitive Impairment Project Summary The prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD) is expected to triple by 2050, contributing to decreased quality of life, increased medical care utilization, and additional burden on an already stressed primary care system. Many clinicians lack confidence to assess, diagnose and manage cognitive impairment (CI), and more than 50% of patients with CI are undiagnosed. Unfortunately, studies show that even in settings with high rates of standardized CI screening, very few patients who screen positive have documentation of any clinician follow-up action. To address these important problems, in phase 1 (R61) of this project, we will develop and validate a machine learning model (called MC-PLUS) using results from brief Mini- Cog (MC) screens completed routinely at Annual Medicare Wellness exams and electronic health record (EHR) data to identify patients at elevated risk of a future dementia diagnosis (AD/ADRD). We will also develop and validate a web-based and EHR-integrated CI clinical decision support (CI-CDS) system to engage patients and clinicians in conversation about elevated dementia risk, and to give clinicians the confidence and tools they need to diagnose and manage CI. Both MC-PLUS and the CI-CDS system will be added into an existing web-based CDS platform that has high use rates and primary care clinician satisfaction, and is already seamlessly integrated within the EHR. This CDS platform improves outcomes for patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes and high cardiovascular risk as shown in published studies. We will systematically validate the CI-CDS system with expert champions prior to conducting a pilot test at one primary care clinic. After milestones for success are demonstrated, we will begin phase 2 (R33), a large pragmatic trial with 30 primary care clinics randomized to receive CI-CDS or usual care (UC). We will evaluate change in clinician confidence in CI detection and care management in CI-CDS compared to UC clinics. If successful, the CI-CDS system will improve rates of new CI diagnosis and narrow existing sociodemographic disparities in adults with elevated dementia risk identified by MC-PLUS at index visit in CI-CDS compared to UC clinics. We will evaluate the impact of the intervention on care management and care plans using EHR data and chart audits. We will assess determinants of clinician actions in response to the CDS system using behavior change theory and technology acceptance constructs, and conduct phone surveys of patient and caregiver dyads to evaluate intervention effects on feelings of preparedness for decision making and distress. The CI-CDS system is immediately scalable to large numbers of patients through the existing non-commercialized CDS platform already in use for millions of patients in care systems spanning 14 states. The CDS system implemented as described could maximize return on massive investments that have been made in EHR systems, and provide a prototype to rapidly and consistently translate evolving evidence-based CI guidelines into personalized CI care and guidance within primary care. Project Narrative Most experts advocate for early detection of cognitive impairment (CI) so that patients and caregivers can be prepared for making difficult decisions and to improve quality of life, but studies show that screening alone isn’t sufficient to change clinician actions related to early detection. Using predictive modelling developed with machine learning methods and sophisticated clinical decision support (CDS) tools, it is possible to identify patients at elevated risk for CI and make it much easier for primary care to engage and support patients and caregivers in meaningful care planning. In this project, we implement and evaluate a low-cost, highly scalable CI-CDS system integrated within the electronic health record that has high potential to improve early CI detection and care and translate massive public and private sector investments in health informatics into tangible health benefits for large numbers of people.",A Technology-Driven Intervention to Improve Early Detection and Management of Cognitive Impairment,10266775,R61AG069770,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Attention ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' health care expenditure ', ' healthcare expenditure ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' indexing ', ' Inpatients ', ' Interview ', ' Investments ', ' Office Visits ', ' physician office visit ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Patient Care Planning ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Printing ', ' Private Sector ', ' Public Sector ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Recommendation ', ' Risk ', ' Standardization ', ' Stress ', ' Suggestion ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' satisfaction ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' behavior change ', ' Visit ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' success ', ' Reporting ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' Health Informatics ', ' consumer informatics ', ' Public Health Informatics ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Predictive Value ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' cost ', ' care systems ', ' care services ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Prevalence ', ' prototype ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' intervention effect ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' pragmatic effectiveness trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' screening ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' personalized care ', ' Precision care ', ' individualized care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' support tools ', ' Theory of Change ', ' improved outcome ', ' clinical decision support ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' dementia risk ', ' risk factor for dementia ', ' risk for dementia ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIA,HEALTHPARTNERS INSTITUTE,R61,2021,581392,MN-03
"Digital Detection of Dementia Studies (D cubed Studies). PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Every year Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) adversely affect millions of Americans at a societal cost of more than $200 million.1 Concurrently, half of Americans living with ADRD never receive a diagnosis.2-7 Early detection helps those with ADRD and their caregivers better plan and potentially lessen the burden of lengthy and costly medical care. Current investigational approaches using biomarkers for early detection are invasive, costly, and sometimes inaccessible to patients. The National Institute on Aging calls for the development of effective, scalable and low cost approaches for early detection of ADRD (RFA-AG-20-051). Currently, primary care clinicians provide the majority of care to older adults living with ADRD.1-5 Our interdisciplinary scientific teams have developed and tested scalable early detection approaches.10, 11 We are proposing to evaluate an integrated approach embedded in the Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) that leverages Electronic Health Record systems, machine learning models, and patient reported outcomes to deploy a low- cost and scalable approach for early detection of ADRD. Our proposed studies will leverage previously developed machine learning models (Passive Digital Marker) and patient reported outcomes (Quick Dementia Rating Scale). The design of our proposed studies is predicated on the notion that patient screening is done to identify a more targeted group of referral for applicable diagnostic and management services. We will conduct two complementary multi-site studies to evaluate the effectiveness of two scalable approaches for early detection of ADRD. The first study will be a clinical validation study of the three scalable approaches; the Passive Digital Marker (PDM) that uses EHR data, the Quick Dementia Rating Scale (QDRS) that uses patient reported outcomes (PROs) imbedded within the EHR system, and the combination of both (PDM + QDRS). The second study will be a pragmatic cluster-randomized controlled comparative effectiveness trial of two screening approaches embedded within the AWV, as compared to the AWV-only process, in increasing the incidence rate of new ADRD. In the final year of the study, we will share our codes for both the Passive Digital Marker and the QDRS with Epic headquarters to ensure that these codes are available for any healthcare system with Epic nationwide. The high costs of treating Alzheimer’s disease and the costs incurred by patients and caregivers, both tangible and intangible, are a major threat to public health and the US economy. Developing scalable and low cost instruments and assessments integrated into EHR data will assist physicians in early detection, more and better diagnoses, and clinically meaningful care recommendations. Cost effective, scalable, and noninvasive models are urgently needed to proactively mitigate these costs and prolonged medical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will consist of two complementary studies at diverse urban, suburban, and rural primary care practices within Central Indiana and South Florida. The first study Aim will evaluate the predictive performance of the Passive Digital Marker, the Quick Dementia Rating Scale (QDRS) using Patient-reported Outcome (PRO) data embedded within the Electronic Health Records, and the combined approach (Passive + QDRS) in the early detection of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD), compared to the gold standard of diagnoses. The second study Aim will evaluate the practical utility and effect of the Passive Digital Marker, the QDRS, and the combined methods in improving the annual rate of new documented ADRD diagnosis in primary care practices. The project will compare different approaches to early detection of ADRD, crucial to the endeavors to stop dementia progression; it will also evaluate the low-cost combined methods and integrated approach to overcome current barriers to ADRD detection.",Digital Detection of Dementia Studies (D cubed Studies).,10266121,R01AG069765,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Florida ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Gold ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Incidence ', ' Indiana ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Measures ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' medical costs ', ' Quick Test for Liver Function ', ' Quick Test ', ' Caring ', ' Cost of Illness ', ' Disease Costs ', ' Sickness Cost ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' rural location ', ' rural region ', ' suburb ', ' suburban ', ' suburbia ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' instrument ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Area Under Curve ', ' Investigation ', ' System ', ' Dementia rating scale ', ' Clinical dementia rating scale ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' validation studies ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' diagnosis standard ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' National Institute of Aging ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' cost effective ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' arm ', ' screening ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' early detection biomarkers ', ' early biomarkers ', ' early detection markers ', ' patient screening ', ' societal costs ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' comparative effectiveness trial ', "" Alzheimer's disease therapeutic "", "" Alzheimer's therapeutic "", ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' underserved area ', ' under served area ', ' under served geographic area ', ' under served location ', ' under served region ', ' underserved geographic area ', ' underserved location ', ' underserved region ', ' ']",NIA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2021,1048978,IN-07
"Stanford Aging & Ethnogeriatrics Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center (SAGE) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: The COVID-19 pandemic is having a devastating effect on our elderly population living in long-term care facilities, such as nursing homes. In particular, care for patients with Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD) is extremely challenging due to their special needs and difficulty adhering to social distancing requirements. This administrative supplement under the Stanford Aging and Ethogeriatrics (SAGE) Research Center (P30 AG059307) will examine the emotional distress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on dementia risk in racial minorities. Aim 1 will examine the extent to which COVID-19-imposed emotional distress mediates the association between childhood social distress and late-life increased risk of dementia by race. Aim 2 will examine the mental health and coping strategies of aging minority residents in nursing homes during the COVID- 19 pandemic by recruiting respondents in nursing homes in selected segregated Metropolitan Statistical Areas (SMAs). These results are expected to shed new light on the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic is exacerbating the effects of emotional distress on minorities living with dementia and how coping strategies may help to mitigate that risk and the provision of dementia care. Our results from both Aims will be integrated and complement each other by providing robust statistical evidence on the association between stress and ADRD as well as first-hand evidence and perspectives from residents and caregivers, who are currently at the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic. Project Narrative: The COVID-19 pandemic is likely taking an enormous toll on the mental health of elderly minority patients and their caregivers in long-term care facilities. The results of this administrative supplement project will provide significant insights into the emotional impact of the pandemic on patients with Alzheimer’s and related dementias and ultimately lead to the design of more effective coping strategies for handling stressful events and improve the overall provision of care.",Stanford Aging & Ethnogeriatrics Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center

"US-South American Initiative for Genetic-Neural-Behavioral Interactions in Human Neurodegenerative Research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Although dementia has a global impact, efforts to address ensuing challenges have come mostly from high- income countries (HICs). Whereas the prevalence and incidence of dementia appear to be stable or declining in such countries, an alarmingly opposite tendency typifies South American countries (SAC). This scenario proves even more challenging due to region-specific traits. First, the particular genetic and environmental backgrounds of SAC limit the generalizability of key findings from HICs. Moreover, the greater genetic diversity and impact of socioeconomic status (SES) of SAC remain markedly understudied. Of note, this is true of the four largest SAC (Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, and Peru), representing over 75% of the region’s population. In addition, SAC face a dearth of innovative, harmonized, and cross-regional studies on two of their most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). It is thus critical for SAC to join ongoing international efforts and develop a gold-standard approach for detecting disease-specific alterations in a context of methodological, genetic, and socioeconomic heterogeneity. Against this background, our long-term goal is to identify the unique genetic and SES factors that drive AD and FTD presentation in SAC relative to the US. To this end, we will establish a cohort to test large samples from the four abovementioned SAC, as well as the US (totaling > 3000 participants, including 1500 controls, 750 AD patients, and 750 FTD patients). We will combine standardized clinical assessments with innovative analytical techniques including multimodal machine learning to account for heterogeneity in these diverse populations. By combining standardized genetic, neuroimaging, and behavioral (SES-cognitive) measures, we will test the underlying hypothesis that there are unique risk factors for AD and FTD in SAC which do not prove significant in US populations. More particularly, we will aim to (a) establish genetic risk to AD and FTD in diverse SAC cohorts; (b) test whether patients from SAC and the US can be discriminated after accounting for how SES affects cognitive and brain imaging signatures; and (c) determine genetic, cognitive, cerebral, and socioeconomic factors that discriminate among SAC vs. US patients. Positive impacts of this work include a better understanding of the genetic and socioeconomic factors driving neurocognitive manifestations of dementia, and the identification of novel genetic targets for risk reduction and disease prevention in SAC. Our large multimodal, cross-sectional study will enable clinical assessment of understudied patient groups, extend and harmonize existing data sets, and prompt the development of novel measures and multimodal machine learning protocols. More generally, by establishing a collaborative framework which capitalizes on unique regional populations, our proposal can consolidate a SAC-based platform for future translational research and assessment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although the prevalence and incidence of dementia appears to be stable or declining in high-income countries, South American countries (SAC) face the opposite scenario, with increased dementia prevalence, probably triggered by a combination of genetic and socioeconomic status (SES) factors. This proposal aims to create the first SAC-based multicenter initiative to study dementia, by combining genomic, neuroimaging, and behavioral (cognitive, clinical, socioeconomic) data. This project constitutes an unprecedented opportunity to foster regional synergy and multilevel research towards the harmonization of global strategies to fight dementia in SAC.",US-South American

"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Patients with Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has stressed health systems, caregivers, and patients for over a year. Hundreds of thousands have died, and millions more have been impacted by the threat of infection and efforts to mitigate disease spread. In response to these challenges, the Medicare program introduced emergency policies that permitted greater flexibility in the provision of outpatient and inpatient care, including relaxing rules governing the remote delivery of outpatient care and increasing hospital capacity. Unfortunately, there is limited information on how the changes in care delivery made possible by these temporary policies have impacted patient outcomes during times when viral spread and mitigation policies both waxed and waned. In this project, we will examine the impact of changes in outpatient and inpatient care on clinical event rates and deaths among older patients with Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) living in the community. These patients are particularly vulnerable to social isolation or disruptions in their care, and might not be able to articulate their needs. Those with yet additional disadvantages such as frailty or lower incomes appear to have been even more susceptible to adverse effects of COVID-19 infections. Some care delivery changes, however, might have increased the number or quality of clinician interactions with patients, e.g., more frequent tele-health visits because of less need to travel. Thus, to examine the impact of the changes in care delivery under the emergency Medicare policies, we will address three aims: 1) To assess and refine study variable definitions given data collected during the pandemic; 2) To examine the impact of changes in outpatient care on clinical event rates, e.g., emergency department and hospitalization rates; and 3) To examine the impact of changes in inpatient care on mortality. Notably, changes in visit and referral patterns during the pandemic could impact information capture; thus, diagnosis-based definitions of AD/ADRD status, frailty, or delirium developed in the pre-pandemic era could be less accurate when using pandemic era data. We will examine these care patterns, assess the accuracy of claims-based measures, and develop prediction models using machine learning methods and linked, overlapping datasets; we also will account for temporal variation in documented COVID-19 infections and employment at the county level across all aims. Given these complex data and analytic issues, we will work with NIH’s Social, Behavioral, and Economic Research on COVID-19 Consortium to improve the data resources and methods for this type of work. The information from this large natural experiment is critical for preparing for future outbreaks or other shocks to the health system, to determine which of the emergency policies, if any, should be extended, and to inform debates concerning the balance between local flexibility and national standards within Medicare. Narrative. The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak overwhelmed many health care systems despite the increased ability to deliver care remotely and expansions in hospital capacity that the public health emergency made possible. There is, however, limited information on how vulnerable groups of patients fared during the pandemic or why patients in some areas had better or worse outcomes than those in other areas. The complexity of the issues and data to address them makes working together with a national consortium the logical way to address questions of how to manage future outbreaks and identify which changes made during the pandemic should be kept when the pandemic ends.",Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Patients with Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease Related

"Remote Patient Monitoring of Family Caregivers of Patients with Alzheimer's Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Patients with Alzheimer’s disease & related dementia (ADRD) experience 400,000 avoidable hospitalizations annually, amounting to $5.4 billion in preventable healthcare costs. In addition to financial costs, avoidable hospitalizations increase risks for adverse outcomes, such as secondary infections, deliriums, or acute distress. To prevent hospitalizations, clinicians rely on caregivers of patients with ADRD to report any physical, behavioral, and emotional changes that caregivers observe. If communicated in a timely manner, many such changes can be addressed without hospitalization, but through pharmacological interventions, home visits, or clinic visits. Currently, communication between clinicians and family caregivers depends on the caregiver knowing when to call, and clinicians sorting through messages of various importance to find and address worrisome changes associated with an impending hospitalization. This strategy is insufficient, as it delays communication of potentially significant changes in patients with ADRD to the clinician. It also relies on caregivers’ ability to distinguish innocuous changes from those that can lead to hospitalizations. To minimize occurrence of avoidable hospitalizations in patients with ADRD, we will develop and test the first remote patient-monitoring platform, Digital Outpost, based on caregiver-reported information. The platform will contain two parts: the native Caregiver App and web-based Clinician Action Dashboard. Guided by user-centered design principles and rapid qualitative research methods, we will query 12 caregivers of patients with ADRD regarding content, look, feel, and experience of the Caregiver App. Using input of 20 clinicians through Delphi and discrete choice methodology, we will define the daily clinical surveys through which caregivers will report physical, behavioral, and emotional changes in patients with ADRD. We will also define the algorithms for analyzing and displaying caregiver-reported data in the Clinician Action Dashboard. Then, we will develop the supporting platform prototype using Agile/Kanban-based Software Development methodology and conduct a 14-day pilot study of Digital Outpost with ten primary caregivers of patients with moderate ADRD. Primary outcome of the pilot will be usability, measured by the System Usability Scale, with a follow-up assessment through rapid qualitative methods. Secondary outcome will be feasibility, measured through platform usage statistics. Upon completion, we will be poised to update the platform to include integration of other smartphone data (e.g. walking steps), use a machine-learning based predictive algorithm for hospitalization, and test efficacy of Digital Outpost in reducing all-cause hospitalization through multi-site trial in a Phase II STTR application. PROJECT NARRATIVE Many patients with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias experience unnecessary trips to the hospital. There is a need to create an effective method for clinicians to monitor patient and caregiver wellbeing at home so clinicians can intervene prior to the need for hospital care. To address this need, we will develop and test the prototype of “Digital Outpost”, the first low-cost, commercially-viable remote patient monitoring platform specifically designed to engage caregivers of patients with ADRD to improve patient and caregiver wellbeing while saving health systems costs and keeping patients in their own home.",Remote Patient Monitoring of Family Caregivers of Patients with Alzheimer's Disease,10253642,R41AG072943,"['Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Behavioral Symptoms ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Communication ', ' Financial cost ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Delirium ', ' delirious ', ' Elements ', ' Equipment ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' medication prescription ', ' prescribed medication ', ' Risk ', ' Savings ', ' statistics ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family member ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Hospitalization cost ', ' Evaluation ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' secondary infection ', ' Reaction ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Viral ', ' Visit ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting -

"Commercializing In-Home Supportive Technolgy for Dementia Caregivers Abstract  Caring for a loved one with Alzheimer’s disease, related dementias, or mild cognitive impairment is a highly meaningful part of family life. However, the associated burden and strain can have adverse effects on caregivers including declines in mental and physical health, reduced well-being, and increased mortality. These effects can compromise care quality for people with dementia (PWD). Empirically-supported interventions are needed that: (a) target mechanisms and pathways shown to connect troublesome behavioral symptoms in PWD with adverse effects in caregivers; (b) make low demands on caregivers’ limited time and energy; (c) can be personalized and adapted to the needs of different caregivers and PWDs as they change over time; and (d) can be disseminated successfully into larger community settings. In this Commercialization Readiness Pilot (CRP) application, we seek support for technical assistance and late stage research and development activities prior to the commercial launch of People Power Caregiver (PPCg). PPCg consists of a hardware system (sensors, monitoring devices, wearables), apps, and cloud services that combine Internet-of- Things (i.e., devices that communicate automatically over the internet) technologies with machine learning algorithms that run in the home and in the cloud to create a more supportive home environment for caregivers and people in their care. PPCg was developed with support from an SBIR Fast Track award to People Power Company and the Berkeley Psychophysiology Laboratory (BPL) at the University of California, Berkeley. People Power is an award-winning, established leader in home monitoring and Internet-of-Things technology. BPL has been engaged in basic and applied research with PWDs and their caregivers for almost 20 years. CRP funding would enable us to commercialize PPCg successfully by supporting three specific aims: Aim 1: Increase PPCg accessibility. We will develop new versions of PPCg and conduct randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in underserved populations that evaluate effects on caregiver health, well-being, and user satisfaction in rural homes (Study 1) and Spanish language homes (Study 2). Aim 2: Increase PPCg support for wearable devices. We will evaluate PPCg with two wearable devices that monitor PWD movement and location, analyzing CareActive watch data (Study 3) as a way of improving alerting of worrisome events (e.g., wandering), and conducting an RCT with Apple watches (Study 4) to determine effects on caregiver health, well-being, and user satisfaction. Aim 3: Readying People Power for commercializing PPCg. To prepare People Power to commercialize PPCg successfully, we will: (a) add Spanish-speaking customer service staff; (b) increase intellectual property protection by filing 5 non-provisional PPCg patent applications; and (c) partner with companies that serve large numbers of older customers (e.g., telecom companies and utilities) and have deep senior care expertise (e.g., professional caregiver agencies) to market and distribute PPCg. Relevance  Dementias cause profound cognitive, emotional, and functional deficits. As the disease progresses, people with dementia become increasingly dependent on caregivers, who are at heightened risk for mental and physical health problems.

"Coupling and spread of molecular and functional pathology of Alzheimer's disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive and invariably fatal neurodegenerative disease resulting in loss of cognitive and bodily function, and no cure or effective treatment currently exists. While several pathological processes have been implicated in Alzheimer’s disease, including protein aggregation, inflammation, decreased blood flow, and metabolic defects, the exact mechanism of neuronal death and how the disease spreads from one region of the brain to another is unknown. The goal of this research project is to test whether molecular and cellular dysfunction can be transmitted from cell to cell along their pathways of communication in the brain. To achieve this goal, we will first map the functional connectivity between regions of brain in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, observe how these connections change over the progression of the disease, and link these functional changes to behavioral phenotypes in animals. We will then profile levels of inflammatory cytokines and metabolites in tissue from several brain regions in these same mice, and observe whether changes in immunometabolic state coincide in time and space with the functional connections measured by MRI. Successful completion of this work will test a potential mechanism of Alzheimer’s disease spreading through the brain, and provide a map of coupling between immune, metabolic, and functional pathology that could open new directions for future development of early disease diagnostics and therapeutic strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE While several pathological processes have been implicated in Alzheimer’s disease, including protein build-up, inflammation, decreased blood flow, and faulty metabolism, the exact mechanism of brain cell death and how the disease spreads from one region of the brain to another is unknown. We propose that the dysfunctional cellular state leading to brain cell death is transferred from cell to cell along their pathways of communication in the brain. To test this idea, we will map paths of brain activity using neuroimaging in an animal model of Alzheimer’s disease, measure the corresponding levels of immune markers and metabolic function in each brain region, and then overlay these maps to understand how they correspond over the course of disease. This study combines cutting-edge neuroimaging and molecular assays along with machine learning and computational modeling to test a proposed mechanism of Alzheimer’s disease progression, with the potential to open new directions for pursuit of therapeutic strategies.",Coupling and spread of molecular and functional pathology of Alzheimer's disease,10217616,R21AG068532,"['Affect ', ' Age ', '
