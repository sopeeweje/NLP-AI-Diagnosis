"SCH: Enabling Data Outsourcing and Sharing for AI-powered Parkinson's Research Artificial intelligence holds the promise of transforming data-driven biomedical research and computational health informatics for more accurate diagnosis and better treatment at lower cost. In the meantime, modern digital and mobile technologies make it much easier to collect information from patients in large scale. While “big” medical data offers unprecedented opportunities of building deep-learning artificial neural network (ANN) models to advance the research of complex diseases such as Parkinson’s disease (PD), it also presents unique challenges to patient data privacy. The task of training and continuously refining ANN models with data from tens of thousands of patients, each with numerous attributes and images, is computation-intensive and time-consuming. Outsourcing such computation and its data to the cloud is a viable solution. However, the problem of performing the ANN learning operations in the cloud, without the risk of leaking any patient data from their distributed sources, remains open to date. This application proposes to develop novel data masking technologies based on randomized orthogonal transformation to enable AI-computation outsourcing and data sharing, with the following two specific aims: 1) Perform two experimental studies of training ANN models with data masking in the HiperGator cloud for PD prediction and Parkinsonism diagnosis; 2) establish the theoretical foundation on data privacy, inference accuracy, and training performance of the ANN models used in the experimental studies. The interdisciplinary project team combines the expertise from data privacy, biomedical informatics, machine learning, and cloud computing to develop data outsourcing and sharing technologies for AI-powered PD research. The proposed research will remove a major roadblock that restricts medical data accessibility and hinders cloud-based operations of deep-learning artificial neural networks for biomedical research. The outcome is expected to have a broader impact beyond PD research in advancing the theory and implementation of cloud-based medical studies with data privacy protection.

"Multi-tissue high-throughput proteomic and genomic study in Parkinson's Disease Project Summary/Abstract Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder, affecting more than 6 million people worldwide, with the prevalence projected to double in the next few decades. Despite the improvements in high-throughput genomics and proteomics that have significantly facilitated the advancement of biomarker discovery in other neurodegenerative diseases, there are no reliable biomarkers for PD. Currently, the PD diagnosis relies almost entirely on clinical examination. There are several reasons for the lack of reliable biomarkers in PD including most studies have been focused on single molecules in one tissue, small samples sizes and a lack of independent replication cohorts. To overcome these limitations, we propose leveraging a unique resource that includes quantitative proteomic analysis of ~1,300 proteins from CSF and plasma of clinically diagnosed PD patients coupled with validation in brain samples from autopsy-confirmed PD cases. We will pair the proteomic data with novel and powerful unbiased (hypothesis-free) genomic approaches to select the most plausible candidates for targeted replication studies. This large-scale screening of ~3,110 samples could identify biomarkers of known molecular pathways involving PD or with a clear genetic connection to PD risk. To achieve these goals, we propose three aims: Specific Aim 1: To identify proteins differentially expressed in PD patients in plasma, CSF or brain tissue. We plan to carry out a quantitative proteomic analysis using Somalogic SOMAscan® assay of plasma (n=600) and CSF (n=200) from clinically diagnosed PD patients and of brain tissue (n=200) from autopsy-confirmed PD patients. We will also evaluate CSF (n=740), plasma (n=410) and brain tissue (n=114) from an independent cohort of healthy individuals and CSF (n=275), plasma (n=234) and brain tissue (n=345) from AD patients. We expect to obtain precise and accurate levels of a large number of proteins across multiple tissues in the analyzed samples. Specific Aim 2: To prioritize candidate biomarkers based on an integrative analysis of proteomic and genome-wide genotyping data using Mendelian Randomization (MR). We plan to integrate proteomic and GWAS data to identify protein quantitative loci (pQTLs) and apply MR approaches to determine proteins involved in the causal pathway of PD. Using this approach, we will be able to select reliable PD biomarker candidates for validation. Specific Aim 3: To determine whether genetic and proteomic data improves biomarker specificity. We will ascertain whether combining proteomic and genomic data could increase biomarker accuracy. We expect to uncover a genome-proteome network that may provide a basis for novel approaches to diagnostic and pharmacotherapeutic applications in PD. Narrative Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorders in humans. Currently, there are no reliable, sensitive and specific biomarkers identified in PD to date. We expect to uncover a genome- proteome network that may provide a basis for novel approaches to pharmaceutical and diagnostic applications in PD.",Multi-tissue high-throughput proteomic and genomic

"Circuit-based deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease The overall goal of the University of Minnesota (UMN) Udall Center is to develop novel, circuit based deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapies for Parkinson’s disease (PD) based on an understanding of the changes in pathophysiological activity patterns that occur in basal ganglia thalamocortical-brainstem (BGTC-B) pathways. Project 1 (human) will characterize the role of oscillatory activity, coupling and connectivity across the broader BGTC network, including the subthalamic nucleus (STN), globus pallidus internus (GPi), sensory, motor, premotor and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices. These recordings will be performed at rest and during cognitive- motor tasks, with and without therapeutic interventions (DBS, L-dopa, DBS+L-dopa). It will also clarify the relative effect of stimulation in different functional subregions of the STN and GPi on motor and cognitive function. Project 2 (human) will explore the mechanisms and effects of pallidal DBS on levodopa resistant motor signs using MRI-derived computational models and fMRI to examine the pathways mediating these changes. It will use new sensing technology (Percept) to identify and correlate the physiological changes in the GP to worsening of, or improvement in, gait dysfunction. Project 3 (non-human primate) will examine the electrophysiological changes in pallido↔peduncular, pallido→intralaminar, and pallido→habenular activity that are related to cognitive-motor symptoms providing further network-level insights into cognitive motor gait impairments, task shifting difficulties, and loss of motivation, which will complement the results from the human studies in Projects 1 and 2. All center components have synergistic interactions with the Catalyst Project, which will support research efforts of a promising Early Stage Investigator who will use a novel closed-loop DBS approach to probe circuit dynamics in PD patients and their relationship to PD motor signs. The Imaging Core will acquire state- of-the-art, high-field structural MRI as well as rest and task-based fMRI for PD patients in Projects 1 and 2 (using 7T scanner) and structural MRI for the NHPs in Project 3 (using the first of its kind 10.5T scanner).The Clinical Core will obtain clinical and quantitative motor and neuropsychological assessments that will be correlated to physiological data obtained acutely in the operating room, subacutely in patients with externalized DBS leads and electrocorticography arrays, and chronically through postoperative recordings using Percept. The Biostatistics Core will provide overall data management, quality control, statistical and machine learning analysis and data entry into the NINDS Data Management Resource. The Administrative Core will orchestrate all aspects of the UMN Udall Center, implement and support patient education and public outreach efforts, and develop and monitor individualized career enhancement plans for the next generation of PD researchers. Together, these approaches will provide critical data towards the development and translation of novel patient- specific DBS therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE (Overall) The overall goal of the UMN Udall Center is to define the changes in brain circuitry that underlie motor and cognitive dysfunction in Parkinson’s disease and use this information to improve current and develop new deep brain stimulation therapeutic approaches. The UMN Udall Center will integrate neuroimaging, neurophysiology, and deep brain stimulation techniques to improve the lives of patients suffering from Parkinson’s disease.",Circuit-based deep brain

"Web-based Automated Imaging Differentiation of Parkinsonism SUMMARY Across the globe, there has been a considerable growth in the number of people diagnosed with Parkinsonism. Estimates indicate that from 1990 to 2015 the number of Parkinsonism diagnoses doubled, with more than 6 million people currently carrying the diagnosis, and by year 2040, 12 and 14.2 million people will be diagnosed with Parkinsonism. Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple system atrophy Parkinsonian variant (MSAp), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) are neurodegenerative forms of Parkinsonism, which can be difficult to diagnose as they share similar motor and non-motor features, and they each have an increased chance of developing dementia. In the first five years of a PD diagnosis, about 58% of PD are misdiagnosed, and of these misdiagnoses about half have either MSA or PSP. Since PD, MSAp, and PSP require unique treatment plans and different medications, and clinical trials testing new medications require the correct diagnosis, there is an urgent need for both clinic ready and clinical-trial ready markers for differential diagnosis of PD, MSAp, and PSP. Over the past decade, we have developed diffusion imaging as an innovative biomarker for differentiating PD, MSAp, and PSP. In this proposal, we will leverage our extensive experience to create a web-based software tool that can process diffusion imaging data from anywhere in the world. We will disseminate and test the tool in the largest prospective cohort of participants with Parkinsonism (PD, MSAp, PSP), working closely with the Parkinson Study Group. The reason to test this in the Parkinson Study Group network, is because they are the community that evaluates Phase II and Phase III clinical trials in Parkinsonism. This web-based software tool will be capable of reading raw diffusion imaging data, performing quality assurance procedures, analyzing the data using a validated pipeline, and providing imaging metrics and diagnostic probability. We will test the performance of the wAID-P by enrolling 315 total subjects (105 PD, 105 MSAp, 105 PSP) across 21 sites in the Parkinson Study Group. Each site will perform imaging, clinical scales, diagnosis, and will upload the data to the web-based software tool. The clinical diagnosis will be blinded to the diagnostic algorithm and the imaging diagnosis will be compared to the movement disorders trained neurologist diagnosis. We will also enroll a portion of the cohort into a brain bank to ascertain pathological confirmation and to test the algorithm against cases with post-mortem diagnoses. The final outcome will be to disseminate a validated diagnostic algorithm to the Parkinson neurological and radiological community and to make it available to all on a website. NARRATIVE In this proposal, we will be developing, disseminating, and evaluating a web-based software tool that can perform MRI analyses for the diagnostic accuracy of Parkinsonism. Our goal is to leverage our years of experience and algorithm development, to test a prospective cohort of Parkinson’s disease, Multiple System Atrophy, and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy. We expect that at the end of the project, we will have validated a web-based software tool that can use MRIs from different vendors to read, analyze, and predict the diagnosis of different forms of

"DBS Protocols for Long-Lasting Therapeutic Benefit in Mouse and Primate Models of Parkinson's Disease Abstract Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is one of the most effective treatments for patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). Delivery of high frequency electrical stimulation to the subthalamic nucleus (STN) ameliorates parkinsonian motor symptoms, often within seconds, but therapeutic effects wear off quickly if stimulation is stopped, often within minutes. This transient nature of symptomatic relief underscores the fact that existing DBS protocols mask symptoms but do not alleviate underlying circuit dysfunction. A modified DBS protocol, called coordinated reset (CR-DBS), has shown potential to provide long-lasting therapeutic benefits for days to weeks after stimulation, but this protocol has been slow to translate into widespread clinical use because (1) the multi- site, pseudorandom stimulation patterns required to implement it cannot be delivered with existing devices and (2) its mechanisms of action remain obscure, hindering insights into what parameters of CR-DBS should be tuned to ensure engagement of long-lasting effects. Recently, in a mouse model of PD, we discovered a cellular- based strategy to induce long-lasting motor recovery, by using optogenetics to target interventions to specific neuronal subpopulations in the external globus pallidus (GPe), an anatomical neighbor of the STN. Long-lasting motor rescue was induced by interventions that simultaneously increased the firing rates of GPe neurons enriched in parvalbumin (PV-GPe) and decreased the firing rates of GPe neurons enriched in lim homeobox 6 (Lhx6-GPe). Interestingly, at the physiological level, these cell-type specific interventions in the GPe converged upon a similar mechanism as CR-DBS, by ameliorating pathological patterns of neural activity in basal ganglia output nuclei that have been associated with parkinsonian motor deficits. This proposal will use knowledge gained from our discovery of long-lasting rescue through cell-type directed interventions in GPe to guide rational design and interrogation of human-applicable forms of DBS that may yield similarly long-lasting therapeutic benefit. Our experiments will test a novel, mechanistic hypothesis, based on supporting preliminary data, that the pattern of electrical DBS can be tuned to drive cell-type specific responses in the GPe that mirror those previously found to be sufficient to induce of long-lasting motor rescue with optogenetics. Experiments in Aim 1 will investigate the cellular mechanisms through which phasic stimulation in the STN evokes cell-type specific responses in the GPe (Aim 1.1) and use a machine learning approach to identify stimulation protocols that maximize this cell-type specific response (Aim 1.2). Experiments in Aim 2 will test the therapeutic efficacy of phasic stimulation protocols compared to conventional DBS, using behavioral and physiological assays in mouse (Aim 2.1) and primate (Aim 2.2) models of PD. Taken together, these experiments will advance our understanding of the fundamental differences between how conventional vs. phasic stimulation impacts the nervous system, with cell-type specific and synapse-specific resolution, and could provide novel therapeutic strategies that can be rapidly translated into humans. Project Narrative Conventional DBS is an effective therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD), but its therapeutic effects decay rapidly once stimulation is turned off, underscoring the fact that it masks symptoms but does not reverse underlying circuit dysfunction. Based on foundational research into the cell-type organization of basal ganglia circuits, this proposal develops and tests the therapeutic efficacy of electrical stimulation protocols designed to selectively recruit therapeutic cell populations within the external globus pallidus (GPe) of the basal ganglia. The collaborative project will test the efficacy and therapeutic duration of novel stimulation protocols in mouse and primate models of PD.",DBS Protocols for Long-Lasting Therapeutic Benefit in Mouse and Primate Models of Parkinson's Disease,10145825,R01NS117058,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Basal Ganglia ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Dopamine ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Electric Stimulation ', ' Electrical Stimulation ', ' electrostimulation ', ' Foundations ', ' Globus Pallidus ', ' pallidum ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Maps ', ' Masks ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Parvalbumins ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Oxidopamine ', ' 6-OHDA ', ' 6-hydroxydopamine ', ' Homeobox ', ' Homeo Boxes ', ' Mediating ', ' Structure of subthalamic nucleus ', ' Nucleus Subthalamicus ', ' Subthalamic Nucleus ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' Parkinsonian Disorders ', ' Parkinsonian ', ' Parkinsonian Condition ', ' Parkinsonian Diseases ', ' Parkinsonian Syndrome ', ' Parkinsonism ', ' Whole-Cell Recordings ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Deep Brain Stimulation ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' extracellular ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' attenuation ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' motor deficit ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' therapeutic testing ', ' therapeutic evaluation ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Slice ', ' Pathologic ', ' Therapeutic Effect ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic strategies ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' neural patterning ', ' STN stimulation ', ' subthalamic nucleus stimulation ', ' efficacy testing ', ' optogenetics ', ' motor recovery ', ' reduce symptoms ', ' alleviate symptom ', ' ameliorating symptom ', ' decrease symptom ', ' fewer symptoms ', ' relieves symptoms ', ' symptom alleviation ', ' symptom reduction ', ' symptom relief ', ' motor symptom ', ' translation to humans ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' high dimensionality ', ' recruit ', ' side effect ', ' ']",NINDS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,628368,PA-18
"ENIGMA Parkinson’s Initiative: A Global Initiative for Parkinson’s Disease ABSTRACT Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a devastating, progressive neurodegenerative brain disease, with no known cure. The disease afflicts 10 million people worldwide - ~1.5 million in the U.S. alone, and ~50k-60k new cases are diagnosed annually. Risk factors or interventions are extremely hard to evaluate as we lack objective metrics of how PD affects the brain. The vast global availability of brain imaging has led to several promising metrics to gauge PD progression in the brain - structural changes in the basal ganglia and motor cortex, abnormalities in neural connectivity seen with diffusion MRI (dMRI), and disruptions of the brain’s functional synchrony across regions, seen with resting state functional MRI (fMRI). Despite these findings, factors that affect disease severity are difficult to discover, as most imaging studies of PD scan <100 patients. Most PD research is conducted in isolated cohorts from the US and Europe, limiting worldwide generalizability. Factors that affect PD progression are hard to verify, leading to a crisis of reproducibility. Responding to NIH’s call for more reproducible studies, here we launch ENIGMA’s Worldwide Parkinson’s Initiative. ENIGMA recently published the largest neuroimaging studies of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, epilepsy, and autism spectrum disorder. With ENIGMA’s globally coordinated, highly powered consortium approach, we plan to overcome the crisis of small studies with poor power and reproducibility. Pooling anatomic, diffusion and resting state functional MRI metrics from 21 deeply assessed international cohorts - from the US, Brazil, Taiwan, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Italy, Switzerland, South Africa, China, and Russia - we ask: How does the illness affect the brain's structure, neural connectivity, and functional synchrony? What imaging biomarkers track disease progression and consistently predict clinical outcomes? Do genetic risk loci for PD help predict brain decline? What PD subtypes, or clusters, can imaging identify? Combining multimodal data from 2,307 patients and 1,264 controls, we will thoroughly evaluate predictors and brain biomarkers in PD. Our aims are to: (1) Evaluate and rank structural, diffusion, and resting state functional MRI biomarkers of PD worldwide; (2) Evaluate the added value of polygenic risk scores (PRS) in predicting PD brain biomarkers; (3) Predict future functional decline in PD with machine learning, multi-modal imaging and genomics. We will use genetic data and baseline clinical variables from PD patients and healthy controls across our cohorts to construct an ensemble of models to predict the annual rate of change in combined scores from the Movement Disorder Society—Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale parts II and III. We will rank the best predictors of decline, and assess how robust they are internationally. By better modeling variance in patient outcomes, our multimodal predictive model will empower PD clinical trials by ranking biomarkers of disease burden and determining the contexts where they are reliable, accurate, and feasible to use. NARRATIVE Over 10 million people worldwide live with Parkinson’s Disease (PD) - the world’s second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease: PD’s economic cost is ~$14.4 billion in the U.S. alone. Here we launch ENIGMA’s Worldwide Parkinson’s Initiative - the largest and most highly-powered neuroimaging investigation of PD - pooling data from 21 cohorts from North America (US), South America (Brazil), Europe (Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, UK), Asia (China, Taiwan, Japan), Africa (South Africa) and Oceania (New Zealand). Using global data to offer unprecedented power, we will identify genomic, interventional, and environmental factors that consistently impact disease severity and progression, supporting the development of personalized treatments.",ENIGMA Parkinson’s Initiative: A Global Initiative for Parkinson’s Disease,10209632,R01NS107513,"['Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala

"DaTscan-based Disease Progression Models for Early-stage Parkinson’s Disease Project Summary Parkinson's disease (PD) is heterogeneous: it has many subtypes and the disease progresses at different rates in different subtypes. Disease progression in early-stage PD is observed as signal changes in SPECT imaging with 123I-FP-CIT, which is called DaTscan imaging, or simply DaTscan. The goal of the research proposed here is to create accurate models of heterogeneous PD progression using DaTscan images. Such models will not only provide additional insight into PD, but they are also critically important in assessing the effect of neuro-protective therapy. A new set of models called mixtures of linear dynamical systems (MLDS) are proposed to model early-state PD progression as it manifests in DaTscans. MLDS models combine machine-learning methods with linear dynamical system theory. They capture many features of early-stage PD progression: laterality, non-linear progression, as well as PD heterogeneity. Preliminary results show that, MLDS is accurate, finds progression subtypes, relates well to clinical data (MDS-UPDRS motor scores), and gives genuinely new insights about PD progression. The proposed research aims to develop the MLDS methodology in region-of-interest as well as voxel-based frameworks. A detailed discussion of the MLDS theory, model fitting, and the relation to clinical data is included. Longitudinal DaTscan images as well as MDS-UPDRS motor scores are available for over 440 subjects from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), and this data set will be used along with MLDS to create the PD progression models. Project Narrative How Parkinson's disease (PD) progresses is poorly understood. This research proposes to develop precise disease progression models for PD using machine-learning. These models will give greater insight into PD progression and also help assess PD therapy.",DaTscan-based Disease Progression Models for Early-stage Parkinson’s Disease,10149422,R01NS107328,"['Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Left ', ' Anterior ', ' Clinical ', ' insight ', ' Bilateral ', ' Disease Progression ', ' uptake ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' nerve cell death ', ' nerve cell loss ', ' neuron cell death ', ' neuron cell loss ', ' neuron death ', ' neuronal cell death ', ' neuronal cell loss ', ' neuronal death ', ' neuronal loss ', ' neuron loss ', ' expectation ', ' Modeling ', ' model design ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Clinical Data ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ', ' NINDS ', ' National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke ', ' Coupled ', ' Coupling ', ' presynaptic ', ' progression marker ', ' progression biomarker ', ' dynamic system ', ' dynamical system ', ' disease heterogeneity ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', "" Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale "", ' MDS-UPDRS ', "" MDS-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale "", ' UPDRS ', "" Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale "", ' Algorithms ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Exhibits ', ' Globus Pallidus ', ' pallidum ', ' Goals ', ' Joints ', ' Handedness ', ' Laterality ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' putamen ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Systems Theory ', ' single photon emission computed tomography ', ' SPECT ', ' SPECT imaging ', ' Single-Photon Emission-Computed Radionuclide Tomography ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' dopamine transporter ', ' DAT dopamine transporter ', ' Glean ', ' ']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,352779,CT-03
"A Multi-omics approach to Environment and Depression in Parkinsons disease (MOOD-PD) Project Abstract We propose to use metabolic and multi-omic markers to elucidate how chronic, long-term pesticide exposures affect the occurrence of depression and anxiety in elderly living in a rural environment and those who develop Parkinson’s disease (PD) and depression. Depression and anxiety disorders are the most common types of mental disorders in older adults. Depression prevalence is as high as 25% in long-term care settings and strongly contributes to health care use for comorbid illnesses1-5. Major depressive episodes and clinical anxiety occur at a much higher rate among PD patients even well before PD diagnosis1,2. Improving our understanding of modifiable risk factors and mechanisms involved in depression and anxiety amongst the elderly is an urgent public health matter. Over the past two decades, our team has generated a unique data resource that now provides us with the opportunity to investigate the contributions of common and important environmental exposures (pesticides) to depression and anxiety and to explore disease processes through multidimensional biologic networks. With prior funding, we have collected lifetime depression/anxiety diagnosis and treatment histories as well as current (and follow-up) status of depressive and anxiety symptoms in a large population- based case control study of PD among residents of the California Central Valley, including more than 500 PD patients we closely followed for over a decade. Among these individuals, as many as 38% of PD patients and 27% of elderly without PD reported a diagnosis of depression or anxiety disorder at any time during their life. For all study participants we have genome (Illumina Global Screening Array, 660K markers) data available, and for ~800 additionally we generated epigenome (Illumina Infinium 450K DNA platform; genome-wide DNA methylation) and untargeted metabolomic data (at two time points for 300 participants). We developed a longitudinal geographic information system (GIS) based assessment for pesticide exposures that links state-mandated information on type, date, and location of all agricultural pesticide applications in California recorded since 1974 to land use maps and study participants’ residences and work places. Additionally, we collected extensive information on occupational, home and gardening use of pesticides. Biologic processes, including biologic (metabolic, epigenetic) responses to chronic toxicant exposures or disease processes are dynamic but also dependent on genetic susceptibilities. Here, we propose to combine a powerful systems biology analytic approach to interrogate epigenetic and metabolomic data anchored in genetics to identify signatures for specific pesticide exposures (organophosphates, pyrethroids, neonicotinoids) and peripheral disease processes related to depression in PD. Our data uniquely position us to efficiently conduct a high-risk pilot study that investigates multidimensional networks using supervised machine learning methods to identify chronic response patterns in biologic systems across different molecular layers that can be linked to exposure and/or disease processes. Assembling our multi-omic data into multidimensional networks will address gaps in our current knowledge concerning molecular mechanisms contributing to depression and anxiety disorders in PD, a major neurodegenerative disorder of growing importance in aging societies. Project Narrative Depression is highly prevalent in the elderly and in Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients especially. We propose to identify multi-omics (genomics, epigenomic metabolic) signatures of chronic pesticide exposures and for depression in 580 PD patients and 250 population-control individuals and obtain a more holistic understanding of molecular changes contributing to depression and anxiety disorders and chronic pesticide exposures in neurodegenerative disorders. Our approach incorporates multidimensional network and system analyses to address gaps in our current knowledge concerning the contributions of chronic low dose neurotoxic exposures to complex

"Speech markers of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease ABSTRACT Dr. Kara Smith is a Movement Disorders neurologist at the University of Massachusetts Medical School (UMMS) whose goal is to become an independent investigator focused on early cognitive impairment in Parkinson disease (PD). Her long-term goal is to develop speech markers of cognitive impairment in PD. Cognitive impairment occurs in the majority of PD patients, leading to increased mortality and decreased quality of life. The current diagnostic tools are resource-intensive and have limited sensitivity. Treatments are often offered late in the course of cognitive decline and do not provide optimal benefit. Speech markers could improve detection, monitoring and treatment of cognitive impairment in PD. Speech markers could be monitored frequently and remotely via mobile technology, capturing sensitive, quantitative data about cognitive function in the context of patients’ daily life and in response to therapeutics. Dr. Smith’s role as a clinical movement disorders specialist ideally positions her to lead the application of advanced speech and language research to feasible, patient-oriented tools for real-life clinical practice and clinical trials. Dr. Smith has assembled an expert interdisciplinary mentorship team ideally suited for the goals of this innovative proposal. Dr. Smith and her team have previously shown that a) speech acoustic markers are associated with cognitive function in non-demented PD patients, and b) PD patients with mild cognitive impairment had linguistic deficits including pauses within utterances and grammaticality. Building on these results, Dr. Smith proposes to study speech and language more comprehensively in PD patients with and without mild cognitive impairment and controls to confirm these preliminary results and identify additional biomarkers. The aims of this study will be 1) to develop algorithms using speech acoustic markers to categorize by cognitive status, 2) to identify linguistic markers associated with mild cognitive impairment in PD, and 3) to assess on-line syntactic processing in PD subjects with mild cognitive impairment. The overall goal of the proposal is to identify speech and language markers of early cognitive dysfunction that can be further refined, validated and implemented using mobile technology into a larger scale, longitudinal R01 proposal. Further work will also address the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of these speech markers. Dr. Smith’s rigorous training plan includes a Master’s degree, linguistics and speech motor physiology courses, and experience in signal processing and speech acoustic analysis. Through her training goals, she will advance her knowledge and skills in patient-centered outcomes measures and instrument validation. She will gain experience in research leadership, presentation and dissemination of scientific work, and in grant writing, culminating in an R01 proposal. This K23 award will be critical for Dr. Smith to establish an independent career as a PD clinician-scientist at the unique intersection of speech and language science and cognitive impairment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Speech markers have the potential to improve diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of cognitive impairment in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Although the majority of PD patients will develop cognitive impairment, the tools available to assess and treat this disabling complication are fraught with limitations. As a detailed and quantitative assessment tool, speech markers may increase sensitivity to early cognitive dysfunction and to changes over time compared with current measures. They may be automated and then implemented through mobile technology to increase patients’ access to cognitive symptom monitoring outside of the clinic setting. Dr. Smith’s proposed career development plan has potential to fill a major gap in PD research by making inexpensive and easy-to-use cognitive assessment tools accessible to patients in rural and international settings, and by fueling clinical trials to discover new therapeutics capable of slowing cognitive decline in PD.",Speech markers of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's

"Preclinical development of a novel therapeutic for Parkinson's disease Project Summary Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, afflicting ~1 million Americans. Levodopa is the gold-standard symptomatic treatment for PD by elevating dopamine levels in the brain. Though the most effective treatment, prolonged levodopa use leads to 1) the debilitating side effect, levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID), and 2) diminished levodopa efficacy which leads to fluctuations of PD symptoms, known as “wearing-off”. These concerns are two of the greatest unmet needs in PD and affect how doctors prescribe dosages and treatment options, impacting the efficacy of the necessary medications for PD. After 5 years of levodopa usage, 40% of PD patients will develop LID and/or fluctuations. Not only having a clinical impact, but PD patients with such complications require nearly $60,000 of additional therapeutics every year. Using Sinopia Biosciences’ computational platform, we studied gene expression changes due to levodopa administered to 6-OHDA lesioned PD-like mice. Applying our computational workflow, we identified a small molecule (SB-0107) that was selected based on: 1) having one of the top scores from our platform, 2) its novel mechanism of action, 3) previous clinical exposure to elderly patients, 4) its predicted CNS penetration properties, and 5) its potential for patent protection. Subsequently, we demonstrated the compound’s unique and potentially transformative pharmacology for treating both the symptoms of PD and complications of levodopa (i.e. LID). In both rodent and primate models, SB-0107 shows large effect sizes. Further, we observed in a cognitive deficit primate model of PD that SB-0107 improves performances in the tested cognitive tasks. Thus, SB-0107 represents a promising candidate for advancement to the clinic for PD. In this Fast-Track proposal, we will advance the compound by completing preclinical development studies for anticipation of IND submission. Project Narrative Levodopa is the primary treatment for Parkinson’s Disease, a neurodegenerative disease that afflicts 1 million Americans. Unfortunately, levodopa has serious side effects and loses its efficacy over time. Using Sinopia Biosciences’s computational drug discovery platform, we identified a small molecule that we subsequently tested and validated in relevant rodent and primate models, providing a unique mechanism for treating Parkinson’s Disease.

"Differential diagnosis of Parkinson's and multiple system atrophy in non-human primate models using a novel a-synuclein retinal contrast agent and AI-assisted analytics Project Summary Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer’s disease, and a major cause of disability in individuals over 65 years of age. PD belongs to a spectrum of diseases termed the “synucleinopathies”, defined by the progressive aggregation of insoluble fibrillary a-synuclein, and includes other disorders such as multiple system atrophy and Lewy body dementia. Currently, there are no objective tests that can be used to definitively diagnose PD. In addition, differential diagnosis of synucleinopathies is very challenging and relies heavily on a physician's clinical evaluation. A critical goal in the field is to reliably identify synucleinopathies at early, asymptomatic stages of the disease, to allow the best chance for correct disease modifying or preventative treatments to be effective. This proposal aims to develop a small molecule fluorescent retinal contrast agent as a novel diagnostic for PD and other related synucleinopathies. Project Narrative Parkinson’s disease (PD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA) are age-related synucleinopathies defined by the presence of α-synuclein deposits. Accumulation of α-synuclein has been identified in retina of patients with PD. The proposed research aims to advance the first diagnostic to image α-synuclein deposits in the eye with a novel contrast agent.",Differential diagnosis of Parkinson's and multiple system atrophy in

"Mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms and cognitive control in PD Abstract Up to 80% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) will suffer from cognitive symptoms, including impaired attention, planning, reasoning and working memory as well as hallucinations, visuospatial dysfunction, and delusions. These impairments lead to mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and dementia (PDD) in PD. Cognitive symptoms of PD are associated with enormous cost to our society. There are no clear biomarkers and few effective treatments for PD-MCI/PDD. Because risk for PD increases dramatically with age, this problem will surge as our population grows older. The mechanisms contributing to PD-MCI/PDD are unknown. Our group has found that low-frequency (1-8 Hz; or delta/theta bands) brain rhythms might be helpful in diagnosing cognitive dysfunction in PD. This delta/theta activity originates from areas of medial frontal cortex such as the anterior cingulate, and is detectable by mid-frontal scalp EEG electrodes. We have found that mid-frontal delta/theta brain rhythms are engaged when healthy individuals detect novelty, errors, and conflict, or make decisions. These rhythms are attenuated in PD patients. Our working model is that PD patients manifest diverse neuronal and network deficits that impair mid-frontal delta/theta activity, leading to failures in engaging cognitive control. These abnormalities contribute to PD-MCI and PDD. In this proposal we combine `big-data' machine learning tools, intraoperative neurophysiology in humans, and new brain-stimulation paradigms to investigate the role of mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms in PD. We will test the overall hypothesis that mid-frontal delta/theta impairments are a mechanism of cognitive dysfunction in PD. In Aim 1 we will determine if mid-frontal delta/theta activity predicts PD-MCI/PDD. In Aim 2 we will use unique intraoperative recordings to determine how delta/theta activity within medial frontal cortex influences neurons in the subthalamic nucleus, a key site of functional convergence that is targeted by current deep-brain stimulation for PD. Notably, the subthalamic nucleus is a compact structure that receives highly overlapping input from cognitive and motor cortical regions, making it likely that our recordings will capture cognitive processing within this nucleus. Finally, in Aim 3 we will determine if subthalamic nucleus deep-brain stimulation at delta/theta frequencies improves cognitive control in PD patients. Because these experiments involve recordings across several PD patient populations (Aim 1), from single subthalamic neurons (Aim 2), and brain stimulation (Aim 3), each of these aims will provide independent mechanistic insight into cognitive dysfunction in PD. PD is a complex disease, but if cortical EEG abnormalities are a consistent theme it might inspire new diagnostic tools or new brain-stimulation therapies for cognitive dysfunction in PD. Results from this proposal could also be important for other neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease.     Public Health Relevance Cognitive symptoms of Parkinson's disease are an enormous public health problem. Here, we will ana- lyze brain rhythms that are involved in cognitive processing and also dysfunctional in Parkinson's dis- ease. We will use these brain rhythms to guide novel brain stimulation that has the potential to treat dementia and cognitive impairments in Parkinson's disease.  ",Mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms and
