"Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites PROJECT SUMMARY The human colon houses a complex community of microbes, known as the gut microbiota, which possesses unmapped metabolic capabilities. Bacterial metabolic pathways process components of diet, like amino acids, and produce an array of ill-defined metabolites. Many of the metabolites produced by this microbial ecosystem are absorbed by the human host, modified by host enzymes, and ultimately excreted by the kidneys. When the kidneys fail, these solutes accumulate and comprise a significant portion of the ""uremic"" solutes found at very high levels in the plasma of patients maintained on dialysis. These compounds can vary widely between individual patients, yet are relatively stable over time within an individual, potentially reflecting inter-individual differences in gut microbiota composition. A few of these molecules have been investigated and linked to poor health outcomes in renal patients. For most of these compounds, however, neither the biochemical pathways responsible for their formation nor their biological effects on the host have been elucidated. This application is focused on the prevalent high concentration uremic solutes derived from tyrosine, 4- ethylphenylsulfate (4-EPS) and p-cresolsulfate (PCS), as well as 4-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid sulfate, a tyrosine metabolite not associated with uremia but important in understanding the tyrosine-utilization niche within the gut ecosystem. The goals of the research are to (i) determine the genes and species within the gut microbiota responsible for production of the microbial metabolites 4-ethylphenol and p-cresol that serve as precursors to 4-EPS and PCS; (ii) elucidate the effects of these molecules on aspects of host biology relevant to uremic illness; and (iii) investigate two distinct strategies for microbiota reprogramming with a goal of lowering uremic solute levels in a host. Aim 1 employs two approaches to predict microbial metabolic pathways, one using a computational/machine learning approach and a second method using comparative genomics combined with bacterial metabolomic phenotyping. Gene predictions will be genetically validated using gene deletion or heterologous expression. In Aim 2, gnotobiotic mice are used as a platform to investigate the conversion of microbial metabolites into circulating solutes, and how solute levels are affected by diet and other members of the microbiota. Isotopically labeled amino acids are used to trace dietary substrates to uremic solute products. Aim 3 leverages gnotobiotic mice colonized by WT versus mutant bacteria, which differ in the presence or absence of 4-EPS or PCS, to examine the effect of the metabolite on host biology. Changes in arterial thrombosis and cognitive function relevant to uremic illness will be assessed. The focus of Aim 4 is to reprogram the microbiota to reduce production of harmful uremic solutes. Single strain targeted reprogramming or complex consortium-based microbiota reconstitution using a diverse array of culturable bacteria will be tested as complementary strategies for lowering uremic solute levels in mice. Dietary modifications or antibiotic-based ablation of the microbiota will be used to augment the reprogramming therapies, respectively. PROJECT NARRATIVE A vast and diverse community of microbes known as the gut microbiota colonizes the human intestine. The microbiota is largely a beneficial community, but also produces some potentially toxic compounds that can accumulate to high levels in the circulation of dialysis patients. This proposal aims to define the bacterial species and genes that make these compounds and how the gut microbiota can be rationally altered to reduce the production of toxic substances.",Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites,10144417,R01DK101674,"['Acids ', ' Affect ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Bacteria ', ' Anaerobic Bacteria ', ' anaerobe ', ' Biology ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Circulation ', ' Colon ', ' Communities ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Dialysis ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Deletion ', ' gene deletion mutation ', ' Genes ', ' Gnotobiotic ', ' Gnotobiotics ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Individuality ', ' Intestines ', ' Intestinal ', ' bowel ', ' Isotope Labeling ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Libraries ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methods ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Poison ', ' Toxic Chemical ', ' Toxic Substance ', ' toxic compound ', ' Production ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Thrombosis ', ' thrombotic disease ', ' thrombotic disorder ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Tyrosine ', ' Uremia ', ' uremia of renal origin ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Work ', ' Diet Modification ', ' Dietary Modifications ', ' diet alteration ', ' dietary alteration ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Taxonomy ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Cresol ', ' tricresol ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Anabolism ', ' biosynthesis ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' Individual ', ' Biochemical Pathway ', ' Metabolic Networks ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' cognitive function ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Sulfate ', ' Ablation ', ' human data ', ' mutant ', ' solute ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' microbial ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' microbiome ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Dialysis patients ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' frontier ', ' Individual Differences ', ' microbial community ', ' community microbes ', ' Microbe ', ' reconstitution ', ' reconstitute ', ' gut microbiota ', ' GI microbiota ', ' Gastrointestinal microbiota ', ' enteric microbial community ', ' enteric microbiota ', ' gastrointestinal microbial flora ', ' gut commensal ', ' gut community ', ' gut flora ', ' gut microbe community ', ' gut microbial community ', ' gut microbial composition ', ' gut microbial consortia ', ' gut microbiotic ', ' gut microflora ', ' intestinal flora ', ' intestinal microbes ', ' intestinal microbiota ', ' intestinal microflora ', ' intestinal tract microflora ', ' comparative genomics ', ' gut microbiome ', ' GI microbiome ', ' digestive tract microbiome ', ' enteric microbiome ', ' gastrointestinal microbiome ', ' gut-associated microbiome ', ' intestinal biome ', ' intestinal microbiome ', ' individual patient ', ' improved outcome ', ' metabolic phenotype ', ' metabotype ', ' microbiota ', ' microbial consortia ', ' microbial flora ', ' microflora ', ' multispecies consortia ', ' translation to humans ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' colon microbiota ', ' colon microbes ', ' colon microbial community ', ' colonic microbiota ', ' microbiota metabolites ', ' microbiota derived metabolites ', ' Infrastructure ', ' analysis pipeline ', ' dietary ', ' ']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,644301,CA-18
"Identification of Biomarkers and Novel Pathways of Alcoholic Liver Disease by Leveraging Metabolomics, Tissue Imaging Mass Spectrometry, and Integrative Machine Learning ABSTRACT Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a serious global health problem. It encompasses a spectrum of pathological conditions, ranging from simple hepatic steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, alcoholic hepatitis, to liver cirrhosis. Unfortunately, no definitive diagnostic markers exist for ALD (or its different phases), and diagnosis requires a liver biopsy which itself carries significant risk. As a result, management of ALD is frequently empiric. In recent years, some progress has been made using metabolomics to identify potential biomarkers of ALD in animal models and human cohorts. However, global metabolomic profiling of ALD in humans has proceeded slowly and as of today, no studies have been performed that relate metabolomic profiles with pathological changes occurring during the development of ALD. Our working hypothesis predicts that biomarkers specific to ALD may be more effectively identified by applying integrative machine learning to the analysis of data from two state-of-the-art analytical approaches, i.e., metabolomics and imaging mass spectrometry (IMS). As such, we propose to use plasma metabolomics (Specific Aim 1), and histological analysis and liver tissue IMS (Specific Aim 2) in three mouse models of ALD (alcohol-induced steatosis, hepatitis or mild fibrosis) to gain unique insights into the feasibility of using these approaches to identify pathogenic markers of ALD. Ethanol-induced damage to the liver results in alterations in cellular function that can be documented as changes in the metabolome of biological fluids (plasma) and hepatic cells. Metabolomics, the analysis of low molecular metabolites (e.g., lipids and small molecules) in a sample, can be used to directly investigate changes in biochemical pathways induced by alcohol in the liver, such as occurs during ALD. Tissue IMS maps molecules in a tissue section, thereby allowing the quantitation of lipids, proteins and metabolites within a tissue in unprecedented detail. When interfaced with histological analysis of a paired adjacent tissue section, the cellular source of the mapped molecules may be identified. We strongly believe that the integration of metabolomics, IMS and histology (Specific Aim 3) using integrative machine learning will greatly enhance our understanding of the biochemical basis of ALD pathophysiology, and in so doing, allow the development of diagnostic tools that can be used to detect biomarkers in other forms of ALD, thereby improving early diagnosis and treatment of ALD. The management and interpretation of large metabolomics and proteomic data generated as part of the project (10-100GB of raw IMS data per single tissue section) require advanced data-analytics solutions. We will capitalize on our recently published bespoke machine learning solution (“BASIS”) for interrogation of large “-omics” data to identify metabolic/signaling pathways and their downstream metabolites disrupted in ALD. The novelty of this proposal relies on the use of cutting-edge approaches that will allow identification of novel biomarkers and their cellular sources in predictable animal models of ALD. Such information will form a basis for more effective diagnosis and prediction of the progression of ALD. Successful completion of the proposed studies will form a foundation upon which studies in human biological fluids will be conducted in the future. In addition, it is anticipated that our studies will also lay the foundation for examination of the molecular mechanisms associated with other forms of alcohol-induced tissue injury. Such knowledge will facilitate the development of more effective treatments of alcohol abuse. NARRATIVE Excessive alcohol consumption induces alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Unfortunately, no definitive diagnostic markers exist for ALD (or its different phases), and diagnosis requires a liver biopsy which itself carries significant risk. Because the early stages of ALD can potentially be reversed by sobriety, regular screening of the general population and early diagnosis are essential. The overarching goal of this application is to establish metabolomic analyses and tissue imaging mass spectrometry coupled with integrative machine learning to identify novel pathways in and biomarkers for ALD that will be applied in humans.","Identification of Biomarkers and Novel Pathways of Alcoholic Liver Disease by Leveraging Metabolomics, Tissue Imaging Mass Spectrometry, and

"Characterizing the serum metabolome in multiple sclerosis PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT  Within the last decade, we have made great strides in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying multiple sclerosis (MS) risk and progression, however much of the variation remains unexplained. We have achieved significant reductions in the time to diagnosis and we have improved diagnostic sensitivity, however specificity is not ideal. Further, most of the FDA-approved MS-specific immunomodulatory therapies (IMTs) focus on the inflammatory disease component in the relapsing phase and have little effect on improving outcomes once a patient enters the progressive phase. The challenge for drug trials is the lack biomarkers to detect and monitor MS progression. The objectives of the current application are: 1. To identify and characterize biomarkers that discriminate MS and from other central nervous system inflammatory demyelinating diseases (CNSIDDs) and non-CNSIDD controls, and 2. To identify biomarkers of disease activity and biomarkers that distinguish relapsing from progressive forms of MS. We propose a multi-stage analysis of pre-existing and well- defined biological samples from two resources.  Aim 1. Identify biochemical traits that discriminate MS from other CNSIDDs and healthy controls. Supervised machine learning and classification models will identify a metabolic signature discriminating MS from other CNSIDDs and healthy controls (HCs) in two cohorts. In the 1st cohort, MS patients who are early in their diagnosis (≤ 2 years) and IMT naïve/free will be compared to HCs and other CNSIDD cases. Discriminating metabolites will be tested for replication in a 2nd cohort comparing similarly defined MS patients to HCs and other CNSIDDs, and other autoimmune disease patients. We will determine the direction of the replicating MS- metabolite associations using bidirectional genetic instrumental variable analyses. Aim 2. Identify biochemical features of MS disease activity. We will identify metabolic variation corresponding to disease activity by comparing IMT naïve/free patients within 2 years of diagnosis and with a recent relapse to those who have been in remission for ≥3 months and to HCs using supervised classification in a discovery cohort followed by replication analyses in a 2nd cohort. Aim 3. Identify biochemical traits that discriminate progressive from relapsing MS. Supervised machine learning and classification models will identify metabolic patterns associated with MS progression by comparing IMT naïve/free patients with relapsing forms of MS to progressive MS from at a single academic specialty clinic. Aim 4. Identify metabolites that interact with HLA-DRB1*15:01 to increase MS risk. In this exploratory aim we will identify gene-metabolite (GxM) interactions involving the primary MS risk factor, HLA-DRB1*15:01. The encoded peptide is involved in antigen presentation and effectively binds to many endogenous metabolites, suggesting a mechanism through which autoreactive T cells may be activated. We will conduct GxM analyses in MS-HC matched pairs to identify metabolites associated with MS risk in the context of HLA-DRB1.  At the completion of the proposed research, our expected outcomes are to have identified and characterized a serum-derived metabolomic signature that discriminates MS from other CNSIDDs and non- CNSIDD controls. We also expect to have identified novel serum markers of MS disease activity and progression, as well as putative metabolites that interact with HLA-DRB1*15:01 to modify risk. These results will have an important positive impact by identifying serum-derived biochemical traits that could be used to improve diagnostic specificity in MS. There is also the promise of discerning novel molecular processes underlying MS, which will provide new opportunities for the development and evaluation of novel therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE It is possible that in the U.S. near 20% of the 900,00 persons with an established multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis may have been misdiagnosed, with 60-70% having been on FDA-approved MS immunomodulatory therapies. Misdiagnosis represents an unacceptable burden, thus there is a critical need for accurate discrimination of MS from non-MS conditions, and there is a need for biomarkers that can monitor disease activity and progression. We hypothesize that the serum metabolome is an attractive non-invasive target for identifying such biomarkers. In this proposal we seek to: 1. Identify and characterize biomarkers that discriminate MS and from non-MS conditions and unaffected controls, and 2. Identify biomarkers of relapse activity and biomarkers that distinguishes relapsing from progressive forms of MS.",Characterizing the serum metabolome in multiple sclerosis,10197636,R01NS121928,"['Antibodies ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune condition ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Financial cost ', ' Demyelinating Diseases ', ' Demyelinating Disorders ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ', ' Lupus Erythematosus Disseminatus ', ' SLE ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematous ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythmatosus ', ' disseminated lupus erythematosus ', ' systemic lupus erythematosis ', ' Multiple Sclerosis ', ' Disseminated Sclerosis ', ' insular sclerosis ', ' Persons ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Neuromyelitis Optica ', ' Devic Disease ', "" Devic's Syndrome "", ' Patients ', ' Peptides ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Specificity ', ' Suggestion ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein ', ' MOG glycoprotein ', ' myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' medical costs ', ' HLA-DRB1 ', ' HLA-DRB1 antigen ', ' Migraine ', ' Migraine Headache ', ' Serum Markers ', ' Guidelines ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Antigen Presentation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' disability ', ' Neurologic Symptoms ', ' Neurologic Manifestations ', ' Neurologic Signs and Symptoms ', ' Neurological Manifestations ', ' Neurological Signs and Symptoms ', ' neural manifestation ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Remission ', ' Disease remission ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Free Will ', ' disease control ', ' disorder control ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Diagnostic Sensitivity ', ' Diagnostic Specificity ', ' Metabolite Interaction ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', "" Sjogren's Syndrome "", ' Sicca Syndrome ', ' Sjogrens ', ' Sjögren Syndrome ', ' xerodermosteosis ', ' autoreactive T cell ', ' self-reactive T cell ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' FDA approved ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' multiple sclerosis patient ', ' MS patient ', ' patients with MS ', ' patients with multiple sclerosis ', ' diagnostic biomarker ', ' diagnostic marker ', ' targeted therapy trials ', ' targeted drug trials ', ' targeted pharmaceutical trials ', ' targeted treatment trials ', ' improved outcome ', ' metabolome ', ' metabonome ', ' immunomodulatory therapies ', ' Immune Modulation Therapy ', ' immune modulating therapies ', ' immune modulatory therapies ', ' immune-modulation treatment ', ' immunomodulation therapy ', ' immunomodulation treatment ', ' immunomodulatory therapy ', ' immunomodulatory treatment ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' side effect ', ' ']",NINDS,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,518973,OH-11
"Contextualizing Chaotic Metabolic Networks and Their Regulation Project Summary/Abstract Cancer metabolism is a complex network of perturbations to essential chemical and enzymatic reactions; however, the past century has seen a largely reductionist approach to understanding this system. While previously this approach was necessary due to technological limitations, current computer age technological advances allow us to survey, model, and explore the biological details of individual cells and populations of cells. Scientific fields, such as RNA biology and metabolism, have experienced massive strides in recent decades with the advent of RNA-seq and mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, yet our ability to contextualize and extract the full extent of these enormous datasets continues to lag and often results in focusing on only a handful of entities from a dataset. This effectively causes “big data” to become “little data”. This is problematic as these experiments are often expensive and time-consuming to produce, yet we only use a fraction of the total data produced by a given experiment. For the F99 phase of my proposal, I will address these limitations by leading the development of Metaboverse, a multi-omic computational analysis framework built upon our previous work to contextualize -omics datasets within customizable and global metabolic network representations. This framework will lay the foundation allowing for the exploration of complex forms of metabolic regulation in cancer. For example, we will analyze the ability of metabolic networks to undergo dispersed and low-magnitude regulation, where, rather than one or two components acting as the core regulatory actors, regulation is performed by dispersed groups of genes, proteins, or metabolites. This framework and related regulatory research will revolutionize our ability to more holistically understand temporal metabolic shifts and gene-metabolite intra-cooperativity, as well as ensure we obtain the maximum amount of information from our data. For the K00 phase of my proposal, I will work with a postdoctoral mentor at an NCI-Designated Cancer Center or affiliated institution that will supplement my training in machine learning and network biology to develop models that improve our ability to predict metabolic state from transcriptomic state. Doing so will allow us to harness the vast transcriptomics databases in cancer biology to better understand the role of metabolism across heterogeneous tumor cell populations. My ultimate goal is to become a tenured professor and run an independent, NIH-funded research lab that focuses on computational cancer metabolism research and that develops methods for interrogating this emerging domain of biology. Project Narrative While cancer metabolism is a robust and well-developed research field, approaches to its holistic understanding are still under-developed and hinder our ability to contextualize these complex metabolic states and their consequences. During the F99 phase, I will develop tools and methods that allow researchers to explore data in a more holistic manner than previously possible, which will be essential to elucidating more complicated regulatory mechanisms within cancer metabolism. During the K00 phase, I will develop novel machine learning algorithms that will improve our ability to predict the metabolic state from the transcriptional state, allowing us to harness the rich transcription datasets found in cancer biology for therapeutic benefit.",Contextualizing Chaotic Metabolic Networks and Their Regulation,10221654,F99CA253744,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Availability ', ' Bioavailability ', ' Biologic Availability ', ' Physiologic Availability ', ' Biology ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Computers ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mentors ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Noise ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Ribosomal RNA ', ' rRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Universities ', ' Utah ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Funding ', ' Biochemical Pathway ', ' Metabolic Networks ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Metabolic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Reaction ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' chemical reaction ', ' experience ', ' Tumor Cell ', ' neoplastic cell ', ' professor ', ' novel ', ' Protein Gene Products ', ' Gene Proteins ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Institution ', ' Oncogenesis ', ' tumorigenesis ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Address ', ' Enzymatic Reaction ', ' Biochemical Reaction ', ' Data ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' Post-Transcriptional Control ', ' post-transcriptional gene regulation ', ' posttranscriptional control ', ' posttranscriptional regulation ', ' Post-Transcriptional Regulation ', ' Predictive Cancer Model ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Transcript ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Output ', ' neglect ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' transcriptomics ', ' tumor ', ' tumor metabolism ', ' cancer cell metabolism ', ' cancer metabolism ', ' tumor cell metabolism ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' learning network ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' ribosome profiling ', ' Ribo-seq ', ' ribosome footprint profiling ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' Multiomic Data ', ' multiple omic data ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,F99,2021,35758,UT-02
"Democratizing Multi-Omics to Expedite Discovery of Hidden Metabolic Pathways PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how metabolism changes in many diseases because we lack methods for high-throughput, unbiased discovery of indirect metabolite-protein connections. Continued ex- istence of this knowledge gap represents a major issue for public health and the mission of the NIH because, until it is filled, development of treatments for many diseases will remain largely intractable. Multi-omic analysis of proteomes and metabolomes from the same system offers a promising path to discover hidden metabolic pathways, but the requirement for human expert interpretation is a critical barrier that prevents complete value extraction from multi-omic experiments. The long-term goal of the Meyer Research Group at Medical College of Wisconsin is to reveal previously hidden metabolic pathways. The overall objective here, which is the first step in realizing this vision, is to democratize multi-omic data collection and data interpretation, thereby increasing the pace of metabolic pathway discovery. The central hypothesis is that artificial intelligence models can learn to draw new metabolic connections between metabolites and proteins. This hypothesis is based on preliminary data generated by the applicant and published literature, which shows how the strategy reveals known and new connections between metabolites and proteins. The rationale for the proposed research is that unbiased, data- driven discovery of new metabolic connections with AI algorithms (such as deep neural networks) will result in new and innovative therapeutic targets that can be manipulated positively or negatively to prevent or treat dis- ease. Guided by preliminary data and literature, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two complementary focus areas: (1) multi-omic data integration, and (2) multi-omic data collection. The multi-omic data integration focus uses AI models, already established as feasible in the applicant’s lab, to predict metabolite-protein inter- actions. AI models will be optimized with existing public data, models will be validated with newly collected data, and then novel metabolic connections will be validated using classic genetic and biochemical techniques. The second focus area builds new, fast methods for multi-omic data collection to feed data into AI models, starting from a recent advancement published by the applicant (Meyer et al., ChemRxiv 2020, accepted at Nature Meth- ods). The applicant’s lab will further develop this method to quantify the full yeast proteome, and also extend the method to enable multi-omic analysis on a single platform. This approach is innovative because it departs from the status quo of slow multi-omic data interpretation requiring expert humans by building and validating a new, automated AI method for metabolite pathway discovery. The multi-omic data collection focus is innovative be- cause it departs from the status quo of slow multi-omic data collection requiring multiple platforms and hours per sample by enabling unified multi-omic analysis in minutes. This contribution will be significant because ulti- mately, the knowledge, validated methods, and resource datasets generated by this project will open new hori- zons in drug development for diseases with altered metabolism, such as cancers and diabetes.

"The design principles of the eukaryotic cell: uncovering the coordination of systems-level organelle dynamics, metabolism and growth Project Summary Perhaps the defining feature of the eukaryotic cell is its organization into biochemically distinct compartments known as organelles. While the biochemical functions of individual organelles are often well known, how cells regulate the copy numbers, sizes, and subcellular positions of its diverse organelles in a coordinated fashion and how organelles interact to produce integrated physiological outputs remain one of the grand challenges in cell biology. The goal of my research program is to discover the quantitative principles governing how cells regulate systems-level organelle dynamics to coordinate metabolism, growth, and proliferation. To achieve this goal, my research strategy will proceed along two directions. In the first direction, I will quantitatively determine how cells coordinate systems-level organelle dynamics with cellular growth demands. Specifically, I will quantify and build a mathematical model of the relationship between cellular organelle composition and cell growth. The model will be calibrated from data obtained by simultaneously visualizing all major metabolic organelles using our machine learning-based hyperspectral imaging platform, exerting chemical biological control over cell growth and proliferation rates, and genetically perturbing key organelle biogenesis, organization, and interaction factors. In the second direction, I will determine how cells coordinate systems-level organelle dynamics and gene expression to control metabolism during growth and proliferation. I will categorize single cells according to their organelle content and systematically measure the temporal correlations in their expression of genes whose products execute organelle-specific functions. I will concomitantly measure the metabolomic profile of these cells sorted by organelle content. I will then combine these measurements to develop a mathematical model that quantitatively captures the connection between gene expression and metabolism as mediated by the cell's organelle makeup. I will subsequently test predictions of this model by systematically tuning organelle interaction strengths by modulating the expression of organelle biogenesis factors and organelle contact sites. Successful investigations along these two directions will yield mechanistic insight into how to untangle the complex interdependencies between organelle dynamics, metabolism, and cell growth and proliferation. A systems- level understanding of how organelle composition and interactions coordinate metabolism to control cellular growth and development will lay a rigorous foundation into future investigations into how the cell actively shapes its organelle composition to match biochemical supply with physiological demand through, how this plasticity is leveraged in health by multicellular organisms to provide the metabolic flexibility needed to develop its myriad cell types, but also in disease by allowing for multiple routes to metabolic pathologies in cancer, diabetes, and aging. Project Narrative Public Health Relevance: In eukaryotes from single-celled fungi to mammals, metabolism takes place in the context of cells organized into spatial compartments known as organelles. In this proposal, we seek to illuminate the fundamental quantitative principles by which the cell coordinates the dynamic properties of its organelles, their regulation by gene expression, and the role coordinated organelle dynamics plays in cellular growth and metabolism. Knowledge of these principles can help uncover mechanisms underlying how cells develop normally into cell types and how in the context of disease, such as cancer and diabetes, they remodel their organelle composition to handle altered metabolic profiles and thus point toward potentially new targets for therapy.","The design principles of the eukaryotic cell: uncovering the coordination of systems-level organelle dynamics, metabolism and growth",10274898,R35GM142704,"['Aging ', ' Biogenesis ', ' Origin of Life ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' cell growth ', ' Cellular Expansion ', ' Cellular Growth ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Eukaryotic Cell ', ' Foundations ', ' fungus ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Growth and Development function ', ' Growth and Development ', ' Health ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Organelles ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Pathology ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' genetic manipulation ', ' gene manipulation ', ' genetically manipulate ', ' genetically perturb ', ' Site ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Biochemical ', ' Chemicals ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Metabolic ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' cell biology ', ' Cellular biology ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Route ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' Cell Growth in Number ', ' Cell Multiplication ', ' Cellular Proliferation ', ' Cell Proliferation ', ' Eukaryote ', ' Eukaryota ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Data ', ' Output ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' new drug target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new therapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' public health relevance ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' imaging platform ', ' metabolic profile ', ' ']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,393750,MO-01
"Towards In Vivo Imaging of Tissue Metabolomics PROJECT ABSTRACT: The ability to measure and quantify the composition and abundance of various metabolites in biological samples, also referred to as metabolomics, provides a unique window into the complex biological processes at different scales. So far, the field of metabolomics has mainly been driven by technologies based on mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. These technologies, although powerful, only measure metabolite profiles in homogenized biological extracts, e.g., biofluids or dissected tissues, thus losing the spatial information of the underlying metabolic processes. As spatial heterogeneity is a hallmark of metabolism, especially in complex biological systems such as animals and humans, obtaining spatially resolved metabolomics has been a dream of many biomedical scientists and engineers. In recent years, MS imaging (MSI) has emerged as a tool of choice for imaging metabolomics, which allows for the generation of spatially localized metabolite profiles from tissue sections. One major limitation of MSI is that it requires post-mortem or invasive tissue sampling, thus unable to probe metabolism at the most physiologically relevant states. This has limited its translation to human studies. MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) is another alternative for imaging metabolomics. It combines the powers of MRI and NMR spectroscopy to produce spatially resolved tissue metabolite profiles, noninvasively. However, MRSI is highly limited in its poor spatial resolutions. Furthermore, most MRSI studies only target a single nucleus (e.g., 1H), thus limited in the number of molecular species measured. The overall goal of the proposed research is to develop a research program that will pave a path towards in vivo imaging of tissue metabolomics. Specifically, we aim to develop an unprecedented high-resolution multinuclear MRSI technology that can simultaneously map a large number of metabolites in vivo, synergizing advancements in ultrahigh- field MRI instrumentation, fast data acquisition, and machine learning driven computational imaging techniques. We also propose a novel multimodal MRSI and MSI imaging framework for validating our multinuclear MRSI technology and integrating two complementary biochemical imaging modalities for tissue metabolic profiling. Novel computational approaches will be developed to analyze the high- dimensional metabolomic data. Success of the proposed research will establish a new paradigm for generating and analyzing imaging metabolomics data. This paradigm will transform metabolomics into a powerful noninvasive and tissue specific technology (from an invasive and nonspatial-specific one) for studying metabolism in living animals and humans. These advances will enable new means to unravel the metabolic basis of normal physiological functions and different diseases, inspiring developments of new biomarkers, novel treatments, disease prognosis and management strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE: The field of metabolomics has mainly been driven by technologies that either completely lose the spatial information of the underlying metabolic processes being studied or require invasive procedures, thus unable to probe metabolism at the most physiologically relevant states.

"Tools for Leveraging High-Resolution MS Detection of Stable Isotope Enrichments to Upgrade the Information Content of Metabolomics Datasets PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Recent advances in high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) instrumentation have not been fully leveraged to upgrade the information content of metabolomics datasets obtained from stable isotope labeling studies. This is primarily due to lack of validated software tools for extracting and interpreting isotope enrichments from HRMS datasets. The overall objective of the current application is to develop tools that enable the metabolomics community to fully leverage stable isotopes to profile metabolic network dynamics. Two new tools will be implemented within the open-source OpenMS software library, which provides an infrastructure for rapid development and dissemination of mass spectrometry software. The first tool will automate tasks required for extracting isotope enrichment information from HRMS datasets, and the second tool will use this information to group ion peaks into interaction networks based on similar patterns of isotope labeling. The tools will be validated using in-house datasets derived from metabolic flux studies of animal and plant systems, as well as through feedback from the metabolomics community. The rationale for the research is that the software tools will enable metabolomics investigators to address important questions about pathway dynamics and regulation that cannot be answered without the use of stable isotopes. The first aim is to develop a software tool to automate data extraction and quantification of isotopologue distributions from HRMS datasets. The software will provide several key features not included in currently available metabolomics software: i) a graphical, interactive user interface that is appropriate for non-expert users, ii) support for native instrument file formats, iii) support for samples that are labeled with multiple stable isotopes, iv) support for tandem mass spectra, and v) support for multi-group or time-series comparisons. The second aim is to develop a companion software that applies machine learning and correlation-based algorithms to group unknown metabolites into modules and pathways based on similarities in isotope labeling. The third aim is to validate the tools through comparative analysis of stable isotope labeling in test standards and samples from animal and plant tissues, including time-series and dual-tracer experiments. A variety of collaborators and professional working groups will be engaged to test and validate the software, and the tools will be refined based on their feedback. The proposed research is exceptionally innovative because it will provide the advanced software capabilities required for both targeted and untargeted analysis of isotopically labeled metabolites, but in a flexible and user-friendly environment. The research is significant because it will contribute software tools that automate and standardize the data processing steps required to extract and utilize isotope enrichment information from large-scale metabolomics datasets. This work will have an important positive impact on the ability of metabolomics investigators to leverage information from stable isotopes to identify unknown metabolic interactions and quantify flux within metabolic networks. In addition, it will enable entirely new approaches to study metabolic dynamics within biological systems. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will develop novel software tools to quantify and interpret data from stable isotope labeling experiments, which can be used to uncover relationships between metabolites and biochemical pathways.

"Computational Techniques for Advancing Untargeted Metabolomics Analysis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Detecting and quantifying products of cellular metabolism using mass spectrometry (MS) has already shown great promise in biomarker discovery, nutritional analysis and other biomedical research fields. Despite recent advances in analysis techniques, our ability to interpret MS measurements remains limited. The biggest challenge in metabolomics is annotation, where measured compounds are assigned chemical identities. The annotation rates of current computational tools are low. For several surveyed metabolomics studies, less than 20% of all compounds are annotated. Another contributing factor to low annotation rates is the lack of systematic ways of designing a candidate set, a listing of putative chemical identities that can be used during annotation. Relying on exiting databases is problematic as considering the large combinatorial space of molecular arrangements, there are many biologically relevant compounds not catalogued in databases or documented in the literature. A secondary yet important challenge is interpreting the measurements to understand the metabolic activity of the sample under study. Current techniques are limited in utilizing complex information about the sample to elucidate metabolic activity. The goal of this project is to develop computational techniques to advance the interpretation of large-scale metabolomics measurements. To address current challenges, we propose to pursue three Aims: (1) Engineering candidate sets that enhance biological discovery. (2) Developing new techniques for annotation including using deep learning and incremental build out methods to recommend novel chemical structures that best explain the measurements. (3) Constructing probabilistic models to analyze metabolic activity. Each technique will be rigorously validated computationally and experimentally using chemical standards. Two detailed case studies on the intestinal microbiota will allow us to further validate our tools. Microbiota-derived metabolites have been detected in circulation and shown to engage host cellular pathways in organs and tissues beyond the digestive system. Identifying these metabolites is thus critical for understanding the metabolic function of the microbiota and elucidating their mechanisms. The complex test cases will challenge our techniques, provide feedback during development, and allow us to further disseminate our techniques. We will work closely with early adopters of our tools, as proposed in supporting letters, to further validate our tools and encourage wide adoption. All proposed tools will be open source and made accessible through the web. Our tools promise to change current practices in interpreting metabolomics data beyond what is currently possible with databases, current annotation tools, statistical and overrepresentation analysis, or combinations thereof. The use of machine learning and large data sets as proposed herein defines the most promising research direction in metabolomics analysis. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Untargeted Metabolomics is a recently developed technique that allows the measurement of thousands of molecules in a biological sample.

"Regulation of Cellular Proliferation by Novel Mitochondrial-Encoded Tumor Suppressors ABSTRACT Cellular compartments are coordinated through a dynamic bidirectional communication network amongst various organelles. Here, we focus on the communication between mitochondria and the nucleus, organelles that each possess their own genomes. The mitochondrial and nuclear genomes have co-evolved for over a billion years and have likely required close communication and cross-regulation. However, whereas mitochondria are known to be regulated by over 1,000 nuclear-encoded proteins, but there is currently no known mitochondrial-encoded factor that actively communicates to and regulates the nucleus. We have recently identified a novel gene encoded within the mitochondrial DNA and named it MOTS-c (Mitochondrial ORF within the Twelve S rRNA type-c). MOTS-c is a small 16 amino acid peptide that regulates metabolic homeostasis, in part, via the master nutrient sensor AMPK (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase). We recently reported that MOTS-c can translocate into the nucleus in response to metabolic stress to bind to chromatin and regulate nuclear gene expression. Further, our preliminary study using a multi-pronged approach, including single cell RNA-seq, bioinformatics (including machine learning), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with quantitative PCR (qPCR), and cell sorting, showed that MOTS-c can regulate cellular proliferation; MOTS-c targeted the p53/p21 pathway and ribosomal processes. Considering the important metabolic role of mitochondria in cellular proliferation processes (29), a critical question that remains largely enigmatic is how mitochondrial-encoded factors communicate to the nucleus to coordinate the metabolic shift with gene expression during proliferation. Notably, rapidly dividing cancer cells had undetectable levels of MOTS-c or nuclear-translocation deficiency, suggesting loss of mito-nuclear communication by MOTS-c. Together, cancer may be a genetic disease in which our two genomes exist in a state of disrupted bi-directional communication/regulation, and may serve as a unique model to start understanding the role of MOTS-c in cellular proliferation. Because MOTS-c expression/function was dysregulated and that MOTS-c can negatively regulate cell cycle/proliferation, we hypothesize that MOTS-c is a mitochondrial-encoded tumor suppressor, the first of its kind to be identified, that directly regulates the nucleus to coordinate cellular metabolism with proliferation. We propose three aims to test this hypothesis. First, we will characterize MOTS-c as a tumor suppressor that regulates cell proliferation at the molecular, cellular, genetic level. Second, we will comprehensively map the MOTS-c-dependent functional nuclear genomic landscape using multiple complimentary genomics approach, including single cell RNA-seq, ATAC-seq (chromatin accessibility), and genomic footprinting using ChIP-seq. The data from each genomic approach will be integrated using cutting-edge computational methods, including machine learning, to decipher the message(s) MOTS- c delivers to the nuclear genome to regulate cancer cell proliferation and survival. Lastly, we will determine how MOTS- c-mediated communication to the nucleus can differentially regulate cellular proliferation and stress resistance in normal and malignant cells using mouse models of cancer. If successful, we predict that our study will have broad and lasting impact on (i) basic research by introducing the paradigm-shifting concept of mitochondrial-encoded tumor suppressors that coordinate cellular metabolism and proliferation and (ii) therapeutic development by revealing mtDNA as a source of novel drug targets (currently there are no FDA-approved drugs based on the mitochondrial genome). PROJECT NARRATIVE Key cellular functions, such as proliferation, require the coordination of the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes through dynamic bi-directional communication. However, whereas mitochondria are known to be regulated by many nuclear-encoded proteins, the nucleus has traditionally been not considered to be actively regulated by mitochondrial-encoded factors. We propose to study how a novel tumor suppressor peptide encoded in the mitochondrial genome that we identified directly regulates the nuclear genome to coordinate cellular metabolism and proliferation.",Regulation of Cellular Proliferation by Novel Mitochondrial-Encoded Tumor Suppressors,10389994,R01GM136837,"['Adenosine Monophosphate ', "" 5'-Adenylic acid "", ' Adenylic Acid ', ' Affect ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Bacteria ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Cycle ', ' Cell Division Cycle ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cell Separation ', ' Cell Isolation ', ' Cell Segregation ', ' Cell Separation Technology ', ' cell sorting ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Communication ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Mitochondrial DNA ', ' mtDNA ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electron Transport ', ' electron transfer ', ' Endothelium ', ' Eukaryotic Cell ', ' Evolution ', ' Exhibits ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' In Vitro ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Language ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Maps ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Names ', ' Organelles ', ' Osteoporosis ', ' Patients ', ' Peptides ', ' Protein Kinase ', ' ATP-protein phosphotransferase ', ' Kinase Family Gene ', ' glycogen synthase a kinase ', ' hydroxyalkyl protein kinase ', ' phosphorylase b kinase kinase ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Ribosomes ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Ribosomal RNA ', ' rRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Site-Directed Mutagenesis ', ' Site-Specific Mutagenesis ', ' Targeted DNA Modification ', ' Targeted Modification ', ' Open Reading Frames ', ' ORFs ', ' Protein Coding Region ', ' TP53 gene ', ' Antioncogene Protein p53 ', ' Cellular Tumor Antigen P53 ', ' Oncoprotein p53 ', ' P53 ', ' Phosphoprotein P53 ', ' Phosphoprotein pp53 ', ' Protein TP53 ', ' TP53 ', ' TRP53 ', ' Tumor Protein p53 ', ' Tumor Protein p53 Gene ', ' p53 Antigen ', ' p53 Genes ', ' p53 Tumor Suppressor ', ' protein p53 ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Malignant -

"Systems Metabolomics for Biomarker Discovery PROJECT SUMMARY Metabolomics offers a comprehensive analysis of thousands of small molecules in biological samples. It can play an indispensable role in the growing systems biology approaches to unravel the relationships between metabolites and diseases. Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) have been used for high-throughput analysis of thousands of metabolites. However, the potential values of many disease-associated metabolites discovered by using these platforms have been inadequately explored in systems biology approaches for biomarker discovery due to lack of computational tools and resources to: (1) accurately determine the identity of most of the metabolites; (2) investigate the rewiring interactions among the metabolites due to diseases; and (3) integrate metabolite profiles with those from other omics studies to evaluate the relationships between the metabolites and the diseases at the systems level. Partly due to these limitations, poor generalizability of previously identified metabolite biomarker candidates has been observed, especially when they are evaluated through independent platforms and validation sets. Therefore, new methods are sought to find more generalizable metabolite biomarker candidates. The goal of this research program is to fill the gaps in metabolite identification and multi- omics integration by using systems metabolomics approaches that will enhance the role of metabolomics in systems biology approaches for biomarker discovery. Specifically, the proposed research program will utilize multiple resources (biological databases, spectral libraries, etc.) and innovative statistical, machine learning, and network-based methods for: (1) developing a comprehensive workflow for ranking putative metabolite IDs; (2) differential analysis of metabolite profiles based on changes in the levels of individual metabolites and pairwise interactions in disease vs. control groups; and (3) integration of metabolomics data with genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and glycoproteomics data to identify highly promising metabolite biomarker candidates. Our recent progress has led to acquisition of multi-omics data and development of computational tools for metabolite identification and integrative analysis. The performance of the proposed metabolite identification workflow in ranking putative metabolite IDs will be evaluated through experimental methods using reference compounds. The differential and integrative analysis methods will be used for selection of candidate biomarkers via multi-omics data acquired in biomarker discovery studies. The selected candidates will be evaluated by targeted quantitation using independent samples and platforms compared to those used for discovery. The outcomes of these experimental evaluations will be used not only to help refine the computational methods but also to identify promising biomarker candidates. In summary, the proposed research program seeks to capitalize on the power of network modeling, machine learning, and multi-omics data integration to improve the ability to find disease biomarkers that are likely to succeed in future large-scale biomarker validation studies. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this research program is to develop computational methods that enhance the role of metabolomics in systems biology approaches for biomarker discovery. Specifically, statistical, network-based, and machine learning methods will be developed for ranking putative metabolite IDs and selection of metabolite biomarker candidates. The performance of the proposed methods for metabolite identification and biomarker selection will be evaluated through experimental methods including: (1) comparing the fragmentation patterns of unknown analytes against those from reference compounds; and (2) targeted quantitative analysis of selected metabolites. 2",Systems Metabolomics for Biomarker Discovery,10206465,R35GM141944,"['Gas Chromatography ', ' vapor phase chromatography ', ' Liquid Chromatography ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Control Groups ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Libraries ', ' Methods ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Performance ', ' validation studies ', ' Sampling ', ' high throughput analysis ', ' Proteomics ', ' Genomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' small molecule ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' data integration ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' transcriptomics ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' Biological databases ', ' platform-independent ', ' Network-based ', ' network models ', ' candidate marker ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' candidate selection ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' biomarker selection ', ' biomarker discovery ', ' glycoproteomics ', ' biomarker validation ', ' marker validation ', ' Multiomic Data ', ' multiple omic data ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIGMS,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,390000,DC-98
"Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining ABSTRACT Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)-based metabolomics is a powerful method for identifying metabolic perturbations that report on different biological states and sample types. Compared to mass spectrometry, NMR provides robust and highly reproducible quantitative data in a matter of minutes, which makes it very suitable for first-line clinical diagnostics. Although the metabolome is known to provide an instantaneous snap-shot of the biological status of a cell, tissue, and organism, the utilization of NMR in clinical practice is hindered by cumbersome data analysis. Major challenges include high-dimensionality of the data, overlapping signals, variability of resonance frequencies (chemical shift), non-ideal shapes of signals, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for low concentration metabolites. Existing approaches fail to address these challenges and sample analysis is time-consuming, manually done, and requires considerable knowledge of NMR spectroscopy. Recent developments in the field of sparse methods for machine learning and accelerated convex optimization for high dimensional problems, as well as kernel-based spatial clustering show promise at enabling us to overcome these challenges and achieve fully automated, operator-independent analysis. We are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on these recent developments in machine learning. In Aim 1, we describe ‘NMRQuant’ for automated identification and quantification of annotated metabolites irrespective of the chemical shift, low SNR, and signal shape variability. In Aim 2, we describe ‘SPA-STOCSY’ for automated de-novo identification of molecular fragments of unknown, non- annotated metabolites. Based on substantial preliminary data, we propose to evaluate these algorithms' sensitivity, specificity, stability, and resistance to noise on phantom, biological, and clinical samples, comparing them to current methods. We will validate the accuracy of analyses by experimental 2D NMR, spike-in, and mass spectrometry. The proposed efforts will produce new NMR analytical software for discovery of both annotated and non-annotated metabolites, substantially improving accuracy and reproducibility of NMR analysis. Such analytical ability would change the existing paradigm of NMR-based metabolomics and provide an even stronger complement to current mass spectrometry-based methods. This approach, once thoroughly validated, will enable NMR to reach wide network of applications in biomedical, pharmaceutical, and nutritional research and clinical medicine. NARRATIVE This project seeks to develop an advanced and automated platform for identifying NMR metabolomics biomarkers of diseases and for fundamental studies of biological systems. When fully developed, these approaches could be used to detect small molecules in the blood or urine, indicative of the onset of various diseases, drug toxicity, or environmental effects on the organism.",Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining,10372268,R01GM120033,"['Algorithms ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Animal Disease Models ', ' Drug toxicity ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Libraries ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Noise ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Plague ', ' Yersinia pestis disease ', ' Relaxation ', ' Research ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Societies ', ' Sodium Chloride ', ' salt ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Spectrum Analysis ', ' Spectroscopy ', ' Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Temperature ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' infancy ', ' infantile ', ' Metabolic ', ' Shapes ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Clinic ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' NMR Spectrometer ', ' nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ', ' NMR Spectroscopy ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' small molecule ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Nutritional ', ' nutritious ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Outcome ', ' Consumption ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' experimental analysis ', ' stem ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' clinical practice ', ' biological systems ', ' Statistical Algorithm ', ' Statistics Algorithm ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' phenotypic biomarker ', ' phenotypic marker ', ' biomarker discovery ', ' metabolome ', ' metabonome ', ' clinical diagnostics ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' high dimensionality ', ' clinical implementation ', ' multidimensional data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' automated analysis ', ' computational suite ', ' automated algorithm ', ' automatic algorithm ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIGMS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,267499,TX-09
"Proteomic Stable Isotope Probing as a Novel Approach for Linking Prebiotics with Active Gut Microbiota PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Characterization of the metabolic interactions between organisms is key to understanding the mechanisms of disease and symbioses between microbes and their animal hosts. Our long-term goal is to advance the applicability and accessibility of proteomic stable isotope probing (SIP) in ways that make it a valuable tool for microbiome researchers looking to measure in situ metabolic interactions of human microbiota. The objective of this proposal is to improve the performance and reproducibility of experimental measurements and accelerate the computational analysis of proteomic SIP experiments and to demonstrate the value of this method for studying the in vivo and in vitro metabolism of prebiotics by gut microbiota. Expected outcomes will represent a significant advance, because optimizing the use of prebiotics as therapeutics requires identification of the specific microorganisms capable of metabolizing prebiotics. By identifying proteins of specific taxa that are synthesized as a direct result of prebiotic assimilation, proteomic SIP will provide unambiguous links between prebiotic metabolism and the specific microorganisms responsible for this activity. We will accomplish this objective by pursuing three specific aims: 1) to increase the performance and reproducibility of mass spectrometry measurements by optimizing data-independent acquisition (DIA) methods for proteomic SIP; 2) to significantly accelerate the computing-intensive database search step by adapting the Sipros algorithm to use graphic processing units (GPUs) and cloud computing; and 3) to track in vivo and in vitro prebiotic assimilation patterns by microbial populations within simple consortia and complex natural communities. Our proposed work includes several innovations, such as the application of deep learning algorithms to improve the analysis mass spectrometry data, leveraging GPU-based parallel computing and cloud computing to accelerate the computational steps in the data analysis workflow, and using proteomic SIP for the first time to track prebiotic metabolism by gut microbes. The expected outcomes of the project include (a) a new DIA- based workflow for proteomic SIP that can identify significantly more labeled peptides at higher accuracy of enrichment estimation, (b) a new computational workflow that is faster to run, more scalable to large datasets, and more accessible to researchers, and (c) establish novel foundational knowledge on the specificity of prebiotic metabolism by microbes in the gut. These outcomes will establish proteomic SIP as a valuable -omics tool that will complement existing approaches to study the metabolism of gut microbiota, and specifically highlight its ability to investigate metabolism of prebiotics and probiotics as they relate to treating microbial dysbiosis and nutrition-related diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Prebiotics is a potential treatment for dysbiosis in human gut microbiota, which plays a role in many diseases, including diabetes and obesity.

"New Computational Methods for Data-driven Protein Structure Prediction Proteins play fundamental roles in all biological processes. Accurate description of protein structure is an important step towards understanding of biological life and highly relevant in the development of therapeutics and drugs. Although experimental structure determination has been greatly improved, there is still a very large gap between the number of available protein sequences and that of solved protein structures, which can only be filled by computational prediction. The long-term goal of this project is to apply machine learning and optimization algorithms to understand protein sequence-structure-function relationship by analyzing sequence, structure and functional data and to develop data-driven computational methods and tools for structure and functional prediction. We believe that by developing sophisticated algorithms to extract knowledge from the increasing sequence and structure data, we can model protein sequence-structure relationship very accurately and improve structure and functional prediction greatly. This project has already produced a few CASP-winning, widely-used data- driven algorithms and web servers (http://raptorx.uchicago.edu) for protein structure modeling. This renewal will further develop machine learning (especially deep learning) algorithms for protein structure modeling without good templates. The specific aims are: (1) developing deep learning (DL) algorithms for the prediction of protein contact and distance matrix; (2) developing distance-based algorithms for fast and accurate ab initio folding of proteins without templates; (3) developing DL algorithms for template-based modeling with only weakly similar templates. This renewal will lead to further understanding and new models of protein sequence-structure relationship and yield publicly available resources for automated, accurate, quantitative analysis for a wide range of proteins. The impact will be multiplied by tens of thousands of worldwide users employing our web servers to study a wide variety of proteins relevant to basic biological research and human diseases, in both low- and high-throughput experiments. Proteins and their interactions play fundamental roles in all biological processes including the maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication.

"Pragmatics to Reveal Intention in Social Media (PRISM) for Health Promotion Abstract: The effects of social relationships on management of health behaviors and adoption of positive wellness regimens has been well documented. In the era of digital and participatory health communication, the role of social ties in health promotion has become more complex. Online communities, which digitize peer-to-peer communication, provide a unique opportunity to researchers to understand collective social mechanisms as well as individual factors underlying human behavior change. Most studies of online and offline social networks have not considered the dynamics among communication intent and content with social influence. In the proposed research, we will develop a multi-dimensional methodological framework for social intercourse analysis to leverage the rich and voluminous data provided by online communities. Our framework aims to incorporate and integrate communication intent, semantics and structure of online communication to study sociobehavioral factors of health behaviors and chronic disease management, While our methods will be generally applicable, we will develop them in the context of health-related communication between members of online communities, particularly focusing on smoking cessation and diabetes management. This research proposal will result in- 1) new theoretical frameworks that describe the communication domain in a online social setting for behavior change, 2) scalable techniques to model expressions, semantics, and social dependencies associated self- reported health outcomes, and 3) new proposals for the development of data-driven sociobehavioral interventions to support individuals engaging in positive health behavior changes and chronic disease management. Project Narrative: This project enables retrospective analysis of social intercourse to facilitate our understanding of the associations between communication (content, intent, structure) and social influence dynamics underlying behavior change and chronic disease management as manifested in health-related member communication of online communities. As a component of the proposed research, we will integrate methods of discourse analysis, automated text analysis, and dynamic network models to analyze electronically captured peer-to-peer communication and characterize communication intent and content at scale. By enabling deeper analysis of communication in online platforms, resulting research can help achieve superior personalization of healthy living technologies and campaigns in offline and online formats.",Pragmatics to Reveal Intention in Social Media (PRISM) for Health Promotion,10199050,R01LM012974,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Automation ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communication ', ' Communications Media ', ' Forms of Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Evolution ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Semantics ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Speech ', ' Technology ', ' Work ', ' smoking cessation ', ' cease smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' stop smoking ', ' Social Network ', ' Custom ', ' Intention ', ' role model ', ' improved ', ' Surface ', ' Health Campaign ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Nicotine Skin Patch ', ' nicotine patch ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' psychosocial ', ' behavior change ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Structure ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Data ', ' health communication ', ' Characteristics ', ' Community Health ', ' community-based health ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' diabetes management ', ' diabetic management ', ' Outcome ', ' Health behavior change ', ' network models ', ' Regimen ', ' online community ', ' on-line community ', ' virtual community ', ' social media ', ' Discourse analysis ', ' Conversation analysis ', ' Self-Direction ', ' health management ', ' health care management ', ' healthcare management ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' social relationships ', ' virtual coach ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2021,343235,TX-09
"Implications of metabolism on healthy aging in African and Caucasian Americans: the Health ABC study Project Summary Over 100 million Americans will be over age 65 years by 2060 (representing 25% of the U.S. population), with an increasing proportion of African-Americans. Understanding which Americans exhibit “exceptionally healthy aging”—an older life free of illness, disability, or functional limitation—is central to efforts to improve quality of life and resource utilization. Current investigations on “healthy aging” focus on systemic inflammatory markers (e.g., interleukin-6) or composite indices of organ/metabolic function (the “healthy aging index,” HAI), both lim- ited by a (1) lack of sensitivity for early changes in metabolism; (2) lack of specificity for molecular pathways involved in these changes; (3) absence of investigation early in adulthood (when “aging” may be reversible); (4) few studies of African-Americans, at high-risk for age-related morbidity. In preparation for this application, we applied metabolite profiling in a pilot study of nearly 300 African-American males in Health ABC, a biracial NIA study of elderly Caucasians and African-Americans, identifying metabolites associated with HAI (oxidative stress, nitric oxide signaling, gut microbial metabolism), some of which may be unique to African-Americans. Here, we hypothesize that circulating metabolites associated with multi-dimensional aging phenotypes and outcomes in older adults will define pathways of “exceptional healthy aging” that may be race-specific and dysregulated in youth at risk for “premature” aging. To address this hypothesis, we will harness two well- characterized, biracial American cohorts that span life (elderly: age 73±3 N=1312; young: CARDIA, age 32±4 N=2376; R01-HL136541). In Aim 1, we define metabolic pathways implicated in race-specific healthy aging, based on association between metabolites and validated age-related phenotypes heterogeneous by race (physical, neurocognitive function, vascular structure, body composition). We will assess determinants of iden- tified pathways, including dietary quality, physical activity, and psychosocial stress (poorer in African- Americans). In Aim 2, we identify metabolites related to “exceptionally healthy aging” in the elderly (freedom from disability, dementia, cancer, cardiovascular disease), their pathways, race-specificity, and overlap with pathways identified in Aim 1. In Aim 3, we apply machine-learning techniques to metabolites to derive a classi- fier for exceptionally healthy aging in Health ABC and apply this prediction rule to young adults in CARDIA to identify young adults at risk for unhealthy aging. We then investigate whether individuals marked for premature aging develop adverse aging phenotypes decades later (neurocognitive, physical, vascular, clinical outcome). This proposal addresses a core mission of the NIA (directly responsive to PA-17-088) by defining a metabolic basis for “exceptional healthy aging” across race and at the extremes of life. We leverage rich phenotypes within Health ABC, funded efforts within CARDIA, and a team experienced in aging epidemiology, metabolic research, and data science approaches. Successful completion of this project will furnish a rich molecular phe- notypic resource to the aging community for investigation of mechanisms and biomarkers of biological aging. Project Narrative Nearly 100 million Americans will be >65 years by 2060. Current clinical-biochemical metrics of aging do not capture accelerated aging, specifically the clinical observation that African Americans are at especially high risk of age-related morbidity. Here, we perform metabolite profiling in the Health ABC study to identify metabolic pathways central to healthy aging across race and examine these pathways in a separate longitudinal study of young adults (CARDIA), redefining aging as a systemic metabolic disease impacting function and outcomes in Caucasian and African-Americans across life.",Implications of metabolism on healthy aging in African and Caucasian Americans: the Health ABC study,10186677,R01AG059729,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Body Composition ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Exhibits ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Inflammation ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BSF2 ', ' HPGF ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IL-6 ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' male ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity -

Based on substantial preliminary data, we propose to evaluate these algorithms' sensitivity, specificity, stability, and resistance to noise on phantom, biological, and clinical samples, comparing them to current methods. We will validate the accuracy of analyses by experimental 2D NMR, spike-in, and mass spectrometry. The proposed efforts will produce new NMR analytical software for discovery of both annotated and non-annotated metabolites, substantially improving accuracy and reproducibility of NMR analysis. Such analytical ability would change the existing paradigm of NMR-based metabolomics and provide an even stronger complement to current mass spectrometry-based methods. This approach, once thoroughly validated, will enable NMR to reach wide network of applications in biomedical, pharmaceutical, and nutritional research and clinical medicine. NARRATIVE This project seeks to develop an advanced and automated platform for identifying NMR metabolomics biomarkers of diseases and for fundamental studies of biological systems.

"A novel lncRNA-responsive and xenobiotic receptor-mediated regulation of drug metabolism and disposition A novel lncRNA-responsive and xenobiotic receptor-mediated regulation of drug metabolism and disposition Abstract Drug metabolism and disposition are essential xenobiotic responses. The long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are non-coding RNAs larger than 200 nucleotides (nt) in length and do not have protein-coding potentials. Although many of the biological functions of lncRNAs have been recognized, it is unclear whether and how lncRNAs can regulate the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters and if so, whether the regulations are implicated in cancer chemo-resistance. Through integrative analysis of cancer non-coding genomic and high-through drug screening data of 505 cancer cell lines, our preliminary study have discovered and functionally characterized a group of ADME(drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) chemo-resistance lncRNAs, including LINC00992, whose up-regulation is associated with resistance to more than 100 chemotherapy compounds and may regulate drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters through interacting with xenobiotic nuclear receptor. We hypothesize that dysregulation of ADME chemo-resistance lncRNAs is an important contributor for the development of cancer chemo-resistance. Mechanistically, ADME chemo-resistance lncRNAs affect chemo-resistance through their regulation of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters that are responsible for the metabolism and disposition of chemotherapy drugs. We propose three specific aims to test our hypotheses: In Aim 1, we will perform bioinformatic analysis and molecularly clone of lncRNAs associated with cancer chemo-resistance and clinical prognosis. In Aim 2: we will functional characterize of ADME chemo-resistance lncRNAs, including LINC00992, using in vivo and in vitro cancer chemotherapy models. In Aim 3: we will determine the mechanism by which ADME chemo-resistance lncRNAs, including LINC00992, regulate the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters. Chemotherapy remains a mainstay in the clinical management of cancer patients, but chemo-resistance is a major challenge to overcome. Understanding the novel lncRNA responsive and xenobiotic nuclear receptor- mediated chemo-resistance will help provide novel strategies to enhance therapeutic efficacy and avoid the development of chemo-resistance. Narrative The goal of this study is to reveal a novel lncRNA-responsive and xenobiotic receptor-mediated regulation of drug metabolism and disposition. Specifically, we propose to test the hypothesis that a group of novel lncRNAs, identified by our computational analysis and experimental validation, can affect chemo-resistance through their regulation of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters that are responsible for the metabolism and disposition of chemotherapy drugs.

"Circulating Plasma Metabolites, Lifestyle Factors, and Mortality Risk PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Recent advances in high-throughput metabolomic studies have shown promise in elucidating potential pathways underpinning aging processes and longevity. However, data in human populations are still constrained by small sample sizes and a limited number of metabolites profiled. Existing studies have also not integrated data on diet and lifestyle to evaluate the associations of interest in a comprehensive manner. A better understanding of aging- related metabolic alterations and whether metabolite profiles are modulated by lifestyle factors is crucial to develop effective strategies to promote health and well-being. The main goal is to identify novel metabolite profiles associated with mortality and prolonged longevity, and investigate whether the metabolomic signatures of lifestyle factors are associated with mortality and longevity. We propose to leverage unique resources from two large U.S. cohorts with long follow-up and extended lifespan data: the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS) (n~8,100). The results will be replicated in two independent populations: the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) (n~2,300), and the Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMED) Study (n~3,000), a population at high cardiovascular risk in Spain. This research application is aimed at: (1) identifying plasma metabolomic profiles and networks associated with mortality and longevity; and, (2) identifying the metabolomic signatures of a healthy lifestyle score and examining its prospective association with mortality and longevity. The proposed project is built on the numerous strengths of existing cohort studies in U.S. and Mediterranean populations, and supporting results from the preliminary work conducted by our multi- disciplinary team. Findings from this study will provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of longevity and advance our understanding of how plasma metabolomics may mediate the associations between lifestyle factors and mortality risk. The proposed research will generate new knowledge that can directly inform specific lifestyle interventions applicable in clinical settings to improve the health and well-being of adults as they age. The proposed research will provide a wealth of preliminary data to stimulate further research on longevity and healthy aging. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to leverage unique resources with longitudinal data to identify metabolite profiles and networks associated with total mortality and longevity, and investigate whether the metabolomic signatures of a healthy lifestyle score are associated with the risk of mortality and longevity, in U.S. and Mediterranean populations. This study has the potential to identify novel metabolic signatures of both mortality and longevity and improve our understanding of how lifestyle factors modulate metabolites and mortality risk, which can help to design better preventive and intervention strategies.","Circulating Plasma Metabolites, Lifestyle Factors, and Mortality Risk",10298057,R21AG070375,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Lipids ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' mortality ', ' Oxidation-Reduction ', ' Redox ', ' oxidation reduction reaction ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Spain ', ' Supervision ', ' Work ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Sample Size ', ' Metabolic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' cohort ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' BMI ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' small molecule ', ' Adherence ', ' Biology of Aging ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' lifestyle factors ', ' life-style factor ', "" Nurses' Health Study "", ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Health Professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' National Institute of Aging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' life style intervention ', ' transcriptomics ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' healthy aging ', ' effective intervention ', ' healthy lifestyle ', ' healthy life-style ', ' potential biomarker ', ' potential biological marker ', ' moderate-to-vigorous physical activity ', ' lifestyle data ', ' life-style data ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' secondary analysis ', ' never smoking ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' ']",NIA,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R21,2021,239250,MA-07
"Deep Ovarian Cancer Metabolomics PROJECT SUMMARY  Ovarian cancer (OC) is the 5th leading cause of cancer-related deaths for U.S. women and the deadliest gynecological disease. Lack of symptoms in addition to the deficiency of highly specific biomarkers for detection typically result in only 25% of OC cases being diagnosed at FIGO stage I. High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is the most prevalent form of OC, but three rarer histological subtypes also exist— endometrioid, clear cell, and mucinous. An effective screening strategy for early diagnosis would be particularly advantageous since 5-year OC survival rates can be as high as 90%. Unfortunately, protein biomarkers such as CA-125 do not have sufficient positive predictive value to be useful from a clinical perspective. We hypothesize that useful information regarding early stage HGSC and other ovarian cancers can be found in the serum metabolome. Our pilot studies in both humans and OC models, such as the double-knockout Dicer-Pten mouse recently developed by our team members, show great promise in this regard— average sensitivity and specificity for early detection have reached 97.8% and 99.0% in banked human serum samples, and up to100% in mice. These results have prompted us to perform a much deeper investigation of metabolome alterations associated with early stage ovarian cancers in larger serum sample sets, and over time. We will perform metabolomics experiments in mice and banked de-identified human serum samples with much higher coverage than before by “data fusing” various modes of ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), coupled with pathway-centric data analysis. We also propose supplementing serum-level metabolomics experiments with deep-coverage tissue mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) in both 2-D and 3-D, using a combination of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and desorption electrospray ionization (DESI), which have complementary ionization mechanisms. Furthermore, we propose to depart from the commonly used approach of tentatively identifying spectral features by only using accurate masses, and implement a “deep metabolite annotation” approach that uses both “fused” high-resolution techniques (high field Orbitrap MS, MS/MS, 2-D NMR) and a new technology based on collisional cross section predictions for both travelling wave and drift tube ion mobility-MS. High-grade serous ovarian cancer is the most common and deadliest type of ovarian cancer; it is diagnosed mostly at an advanced stage at which the cancer has already spread beyond the ovary or the fallopian tube, to the abdominal cavity. This advanced-stage diagnosis inevitably causes high mortality. In this project, we propose to study molecular changes associated with early disease both in mouse models that closely mimic human disease and in banked de-identified human serum samples, with the aim of ultimately designing a robust diagnostic panel.",Deep Ovarian Cancer Metabolomics,10250319,R01CA218664,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', '

"Using Genetic and Blood Metabolites to Understand the Risk of Alzheimer's Disease in Latinos U.S. Latinos are highly diverse, with individuals originating from central and south America, as well as the Caribbean. Latinos are socioeconomically disadvantaged compared to U.S. Whites, and suffer from a higher prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia. Genetic determinants of Alzheimer’s disease may be somewhat different in Latinos compared to Whites: in preliminary results, we found that genetic background, in the form of proportion of genome inherited from Amerindian (Native American) ancestors mitigates the detrimental effect of the APOE-𝜖𝜖4 variants on cognitive decline in individuals from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL). This suggests heterogeneity in genetically-based mechanisms underlying neurocognitive decline in Latinos. Untargeted metabolomics is a promising approach to develop potential biomarkers for human disease. Previous metabolomics studies identified potential biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease and for cognitive traits in a cross- sectional manner, however, very little work was done specifically in Latinos, and the genetics and metabolomics have not been integrated for risk prediction, apart from using APOE-𝜖𝜖4. Here, we propose to utilize a dataset including ~1,500 older Latino adults from the HCHS/SOL with untargeted metabolomics measured at a baseline visit, and neurocognitive function estimated in both the baseline and a follow-up visit. Our goals are: (1) develop preliminary biomarkers for aging-related cognitive decline phenotypes (e.g. change in global cognitive function, mild cognitive impairment); (2) study the genetic basis of the association of metabolites with cognitive decline, and study potential heterogeneity by genetic background; and (3) form recommendations and a grant application to support a larger research program utilizing genetics and metabolomics, and potentially other ‘omics, to develop biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease in diverse populations, and study underlying mechanisms. We will leverage an existing data set of diverse, well phenotyped, Latinos from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos, to study the association of circulating blood metabolites with cognitive decline. We will develop and study prediction models based of blood metabolites, and assess the role of genetics and genetic ancestry on both blood metabolites and their association with cognitive decline. Our results will form a basis for a larger study of genetic and omics mechanisms underlying Alzheimer’s disease in diverse US Latinos.",Using Genetic and Blood Metabolites to Understand the Risk of

"Modeling Homeostasis of Human Blood Metabolites PROJECT SUMMARY  Metabolite levels in human blood are regulated by a relatively strict system of homeostatic control. Previous investigations of homeostasis have taken a number of approaches, and models of glucose and a few other metabolites have been developed, typically focused on a single organ. However, while potentially extremely useful, an accurate and quantitative model of blood metabolite levels under homeostasis does not currently exist.  It is well known that numerous demographic and clinical factors such as gender, age, BMI, smoking, etc., as well as pre-analytical factors and many diseases, significantly affect the levels of blood metabolites. Numerous studies in the field of metabolomics have attempted to account for the effects of many such factors. However, efforts to quantify these effects and validate them across different studies have so far been challenging, and resulted in consistent failures to validate discovered putative biomarkers. The challenges to integrate metabolite profiles with clinical and demographic factors are complicated by the high dimensionality of the data and the numerous correlations among the metabolites. Traditional statistical methods are incapable of accounting for these factors, and hence, investigations suffer from a high false discovery rate (FDR).  To overcome these challenges, we propose to develop quantitative statistical models of blood metabolite levels in healthy adults, and thereby produce a predictive model of homeostasis. Our preliminary work indicates that we can predict metabolite levels with much reduced variance using the reproducibly measured levels of a large pool of blood metabolites and clinical and demographic variables. We propose to develop sophisticated models of homeostasis based on advanced statistical methods and evaluate their predictive performance across different sample sets and metabolite classes.  The proposed project has four main Aims: (1) Obtain broad-based metabolomics data on blood samples collected from geographically distinct sites to explore the effects of a range of confounding effects on metabolite levels. (2) Model individual or biologically related groups of metabolite levels using multivariate statistical approaches to determine the contribution of clinical/demographic and pre-analytical variables and their predictability across collection site. (3) Investigate the interactions between metabolites and clinical/demographic variables using machine learning approaches to identify stable metabolites and key interactions. (4) Provide the community with user-friendly software packages for the prediction of blood metabolite levels under homeostasis.

"Identification of Biomarkers and Novel Pathways of Alcoholic Liver Disease by Leveraging Metabolomics, Tissue Imaging Mass Spectrometry, and Integrative Machine Learning ABSTRACT Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a serious global health problem. It encompasses a spectrum of pathological conditions, ranging from simple hepatic steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, alcoholic hepatitis, to liver cirrhosis. Unfortunately, no definitive diagnostic markers exist for ALD (or its different phases), and diagnosis requires a liver biopsy which itself carries significant risk. As a result, management of ALD is frequently empiric. In recent years, some progress has been made using metabolomics to identify potential biomarkers of ALD in animal models and human cohorts. However, global metabolomic profiling of ALD in humans has proceeded slowly and as of today, no studies have been performed that relate metabolomic profiles with pathological changes occurring during the development of ALD. Our working hypothesis predicts that biomarkers specific to ALD may be more effectively identified by applying integrative machine learning to the analysis of data from two state-of-the-art analytical approaches, i.e., metabolomics and imaging mass spectrometry (IMS). As such, we propose to use plasma metabolomics (Specific Aim 1), and histological analysis and liver tissue IMS (Specific Aim 2) in three mouse models of ALD (alcohol-induced steatosis, hepatitis or mild fibrosis) to gain unique insights into the feasibility of using these approaches to identify pathogenic markers of ALD. Ethanol-induced damage to the liver results in alterations in cellular function that can be documented as changes in the metabolome of biological fluids (plasma) and hepatic cells. Metabolomics, the analysis of low molecular metabolites (e.g., lipids and small molecules) in a sample, can be used to directly investigate changes in biochemical pathways induced by alcohol in the liver, such as occurs during ALD. Tissue IMS maps molecules in a tissue section, thereby allowing the quantitation of lipids, proteins and metabolites within a tissue in unprecedented detail. When interfaced with histological analysis of a paired adjacent tissue section, the cellular source of the mapped molecules may be identified. We strongly believe that the integration of metabolomics, IMS and histology (Specific Aim 3) using integrative machine learning will greatly enhance our understanding of the biochemical basis of ALD pathophysiology, and in so doing, allow the development of diagnostic tools that can be used to detect biomarkers in other forms of ALD, thereby improving early diagnosis and treatment of ALD. The management and interpretation of large metabolomics and proteomic data generated as part of the project (10-100GB of raw IMS data per single tissue section) require advanced data-analytics solutions. We will capitalize on our recently published bespoke machine learning solution (“BASIS”) for interrogation of large “-omics” data to identify metabolic/signaling pathways and their downstream metabolites disrupted in ALD. The novelty of this proposal relies on the use of cutting-edge approaches that will allow identification of novel biomarkers and their cellular sources in predictable animal models of ALD. Such information will form a basis for more effective diagnosis and prediction of the progression of ALD. Successful completion of the proposed studies will form a foundation upon which studies in human biological fluids will be conducted in the future. In addition, it is anticipated that our studies will also lay the foundation for examination of the molecular mechanisms associated with other forms of alcohol-induced tissue injury. Such knowledge will facilitate the development of more effective treatments of alcohol abuse. NARRATIVE Excessive alcohol consumption induces alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Unfortunately, no definitive diagnostic markers exist for ALD (or its different phases), and diagnosis requires a liver biopsy which itself carries significant risk. Because the early stages of ALD can potentially be reversed by sobriety, regular screening of the general population and early diagnosis are essential. The overarching goal of this application is to establish metabolomic analyses and tissue imaging mass spectrometry coupled with integrative machine learning to identify novel pathways in and biomarkers for ALD that will be applied in humans.","Identification of Biomarkers and Novel Pathways of Alcoholic Liver Disease by Leveraging Metabolomics, Tissue Imaging Mass Spectrometry, and

"Computational prediction of gut microbiome-mediated drug metabolism Project Summary / Abstract Notwithstanding pre-clinical experiments and clinical trials performed to identify efficacy, side effects, and adverse drug reactions (ADRs), only 25-60% of patients respond favorably to prescribed drugs, leading to a cost of $30-$130 billion in the US annually. ADRs are partially attributed to the gut microbiome, i.e. the complex and dynamic community of microorganisms residing in gastrointestinal tract. The gut microbiome interacts with different types of xenobiotics including drugs, resulting in biotransformation of therapeutics into metabolites with altered disposition, efficacy, and toxicity. Gut microbiome-mediated drug metabolism leads to non-effective treatments as well as teratogenic, toxic, and lethal effects that in some cases were not recognized until the drug was on the market. As a result, leading pharmaceutical researchers have begun to recognize that the role of gut microbiome in drug metabolism should be accounted for in attempts to improve treatment effectiveness. However, despite extensive progress in gut microbiome research, there is currently no reliable, cost-effective approach to integrate gut-mediated drug metabolism in drug development pipelines. This Phase I proposal aims to address this challenge by developing a new computational platform with the ability to predict microbial metabolism of therapeutic drugs and to leverage that information to enhance drug design and development. We will employ a range of state-of-the-art computational biology techniques to reliably screen for microorganisms that may metabolize the target drugs. The novelty of this project lies in the ability to screen drug-metabolizing enzymes/microorganisms using multiple metrics and methods to increase the reliability of predictions to achieve the accuracy necessary for clinical and commercial use. This multi- method platform will be built, integrated, and validated in an iterative fashion using targeted in vitro experiments on two candidate drugs, i.e. the anti-arrhythmic drug amiodarone and the anti-viral drug famciclovir. This project is designed to both advance our current understanding of microbiome function in the context of drug-gut interactions as well as inform strategies to help enhance public health and economic growth. The value proposition of this project includes leveraging publicly available bioinformatics databases as well as advances in computational biology techniques to develop a more precise, reliable, and inexpensive tool for gut microbiome-mediated metabolism of therapeutic drugs. This in-silico platform could be employed for both current drugs as well as drugs under development. For current drugs, this platform can help increase the safety of drugs by predicting the mechanisms of efficacy and toxicity as they may differ from individual-to- individual. For new drugs, the platform would reduce the cost and timeframe of drug development, while increasing the effectiveness of the therapeutics themselves. Project Narrative Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) place significant clinical and economic burden on patients, their care-givers, and healthcare systems.

"Modeling Homeostasis of Human Blood Metabolites PROJECT SUMMARY  Metabolite levels in human blood are regulated by a relatively strict system of homeostatic control. Previous investigations of homeostasis have taken a number of approaches, and models of glucose and a few other metabolites have been developed, typically focused on a single organ. However, while potentially extremely useful, an accurate and quantitative model of blood metabolite levels under homeostasis does not currently exist.  It is well known that numerous demographic and clinical factors such as gender, age, BMI, smoking, etc., as well as pre-analytical factors and many diseases, significantly affect the levels of blood metabolites. Numerous studies in the field of metabolomics have attempted to account for the effects of many such factors. However, efforts to quantify these effects and validate them across different studies have so far been challenging, and resulted in consistent failures to validate discovered putative biomarkers.

"Diet-derived oxysterols shape intestinal B cell fate by controlling intracellular cholesterol metabolism Abstract B lymphocytes in the gastrointestinal tract are constantly stimulated by commensals microbial antigens. In order to prevent commensal outgrowth and maintain intestinal homeostasis, B cells need to mount a rapid antibody response against bacterial antigens. To achieve this task, the humoral immune system relies on a complex multistep process of B cell proliferation and selection in the germinal center, which eventually gives rise to either antibody secreting plasma cells or memory B cells. Intestinal B cells are also exposed to dietary and microbial metabolites during their activation and differentiation, but how these environmental cues shape B cell fate and antibody response in the gut is poorly understood. Therefore, elucidating the fundamental mechanisms that intrinsically regulate the fate and function of individual B cell clones in the gut remains a central question in immunology. Several lines of evidence indicate that metabolic switches act as intrinsic regulators of germinal center B cell response. However, how B cells integrate metabolite sensing with germinal center and antibody response remains undefined to date. In this application we test the hypothesis that the oxysterol 25-HC, an oxidized form of cholesterol, directly controls germinal center B cell response through its interaction with the Sterol Response Element Binding Protein 2 (SREBP2). SREBP2 is a key regulator of intracellular cholesterol homeostasis, and its transcriptional activity in the intestinal germinal center B cells couples lipid metabolism and B cell differentiation in the intestine. We also hypothesize that follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), stromal cells which are located in the germinal center, produce 25-HC in response to dietary cholesterol and microbiome, therefore linking rapidly changing intestinal homeostasis to B cell fate. Accumulating evidence indicates that 25-HC controls SREBP2 processing, but the implication for this cross talk in B cells in the gut has not been investigated so far. Our aims are: 1) To test the hypothesis that SREBP2 activity controls germinal center B cell transcriptional profile and B cell fate; and 2) To define the environmental and cellular cues that regulate 25-HC niche. The proposed studies examine a very poorly understood crosstalk between oxidized form of cholesterol, intestinal metabolism and adaptive immune system activation. It is our expectation that these studies will increase our understanding of how intestinal metabolism shapes B cell responses and adaptive immunity. Furthermore, these studies will provide a foundation for better understanding of the relationship between lipid metabolism and differentiation in immune cells. Narrative Intestinal humoral response occurs in an environment exposed to multiple metabolic stimuli, from both diet and commensal bacteria. We identified the transcription factor SREBP2 as a potential key regulator of germinal center response. Oxysterols, oxidized forms of cholesterol, have been shown to control SREBP2 activation and transcription activity. This proposal aims to identify the mechanisms by which SREBP2 shapes germinal center B cell differentiation in antibody-secreting plasma cells and to map oxysterol niche and its extrinsic requirements. Thus, insight into the oxysterols-SREBP2 axis during germinal center B cell differentiation and into the cellular and environmental regulation of oxysterol production, will be generated from this proposal.",Diet-derived oxysterols shape intestinal B cell fate by controlling intracellular cholesterol metabolism,10299176,R01AI155727,"['Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ',

"Regulation of Cellular Proliferation by Novel Mitochondrial-Encoded Tumor Suppressors ABSTRACT Cellular compartments are coordinated through a dynamic bidirectional communication network amongst various organelles. Here, we focus on the communication between mitochondria and the nucleus, organelles that each possess their own genomes. The mitochondrial and nuclear genomes have co-evolved for over a billion years and have likely required close communication and cross-regulation. However, whereas mitochondria are known to be regulated by over 1,000 nuclear-encoded proteins, but there is currently no known mitochondrial-encoded factor that actively communicates to and regulates the nucleus. We have recently identified a novel gene encoded within the mitochondrial DNA and named it MOTS-c (Mitochondrial ORF within the Twelve S rRNA type-c). MOTS-c is a small 16 amino acid peptide that regulates metabolic homeostasis, in part, via the master nutrient sensor AMPK (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase). We recently reported that MOTS-c can translocate into the nucleus in response to metabolic stress to bind to chromatin and regulate nuclear gene expression. Further, our preliminary study using a multi-pronged approach, including single cell RNA-seq, bioinformatics (including machine learning), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with quantitative PCR (qPCR), and cell sorting, showed that MOTS-c can regulate cellular proliferation; MOTS-c targeted the p53/p21 pathway and ribosomal processes. Considering the important metabolic role of mitochondria in cellular proliferation processes (29), a critical question that remains largely enigmatic is how mitochondrial-encoded factors communicate to the nucleus to coordinate the metabolic shift with gene expression during proliferation. Notably, rapidly dividing cancer cells had undetectable levels of MOTS-c or nuclear-translocation deficiency, suggesting loss of mito-nuclear communication by MOTS-c. Together, cancer may be a genetic disease in which our two genomes exist in a state of disrupted bi-directional communication/regulation, and may serve as a unique model to start understanding the role of MOTS-c in cellular proliferation. Because MOTS-c expression/function was dysregulated and that MOTS-c can negatively regulate cell cycle/proliferation, we hypothesize that MOTS-c is a mitochondrial-encoded tumor suppressor, the first of its kind to be identified, that directly regulates the nucleus to coordinate cellular metabolism with proliferation. We propose three aims to test this hypothesis. First, we will characterize MOTS-c as a tumor suppressor that regulates cell proliferation at the molecular, cellular, genetic level. Second, we will comprehensively map the MOTS-c-dependent functional nuclear genomic landscape using multiple complimentary genomics approach, including single cell RNA-seq, ATAC-seq (chromatin accessibility), and genomic footprinting using ChIP-seq. The data from each genomic approach will be integrated using cutting-edge computational methods, including machine learning, to decipher the message(s) MOTS- c delivers to the nuclear genome to regulate cancer cell proliferation and survival. Lastly, we will determine how MOTS- c-mediated communication to the nucleus can differentially regulate cellular proliferation and stress resistance in normal and malignant cells using mouse models of cancer. If successful, we predict that our study will have broad and lasting impact on (i) basic research by introducing the paradigm-shifting concept of mitochondrial-encoded tumor suppressors that coordinate cellular metabolism and proliferation and (ii) therapeutic development by revealing mtDNA as a source of novel drug targets (currently there are no FDA-approved drugs based on the mitochondrial genome). PROJECT NARRATIVE Key cellular functions, such as proliferation, require the coordination of the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes through dynamic bi-directional communication. However, whereas mitochondria are known to be regulated by many nuclear-encoded proteins, the nucleus has traditionally been not considered to be actively regulated by mitochondrial-encoded factors. We propose to study how a novel tumor suppressor peptide encoded in the mitochondrial genome that we identified directly regulates the nuclear genome to coordinate cellular metabolism and proliferation.",Regulation of Cellular Proliferation by Novel Mitochondrial-Encoded Tumor Suppressors,10238768,R01GM136837,"['Adenosine Monophosphate ', "" 5'-Adenylic acid "", ' Adenylic Acid ', ' Affect ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Bacteria ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Cycle ', ' Cell Division Cycle ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cell Separation ', ' Cell Isolation ', ' Cell Segregation ', ' Cell Separation Technology ', ' cell sorting ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Communication ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Mitochondrial DNA ', ' mtDNA ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electron Transport ', ' electron transfer ', ' Endothelium ', ' Eukaryotic Cell ', ' Evolution ', ' Exhibits ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' In Vitro ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Language ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Maps ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Names ', ' Organelles ', ' Osteoporosis ', ' Patients ', ' Peptides ', ' Protein Kinase ', ' ATP-protein phosphotransferase ', ' Kinase Family Gene ', ' glycogen synthase a kinase ', ' hydroxyalkyl protein kinase ', ' phosphorylase b kinase kinase ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Ribosomes ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Ribosomal RNA ', ' rRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Site-Directed Mutagenesis ', ' Site-Specific Mutagenesis ', ' Targeted DNA Modification ', ' Targeted Modification ', ' Open Reading Frames ', ' ORFs ', ' Protein Coding Region ', ' TP53 gene ', ' Antioncogene Protein p53 ', ' Cellular Tumor Antigen P53 ', ' Oncoprotein p53 ', ' P53 ', ' Phosphoprotein P53 ', ' Phosphoprotein pp53 ', ' Protein TP53 ', ' TP53 ', ' TRP53 ', ' Tumor Protein p53 ', ' Tumor Protein p53 Gene ', ' p53 Antigen ', ' p53 Genes ', ' p53 Tumor Suppressor ', ' protein p53 ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Malignant -

"Computational Techniques for Advancing Untargeted Metabolomics Analysis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Detecting and quantifying products of cellular metabolism using mass spectrometry (MS) has already shown great promise in biomarker discovery, nutritional analysis and other biomedical research fields. Despite recent advances in analysis techniques, our ability to interpret MS measurements remains limited. The biggest challenge in metabolomics is annotation, where measured compounds are assigned chemical identities. The annotation rates of current computational tools are low. For several surveyed metabolomics studies, less than 20% of all compounds are annotated. Another contributing factor to low annotation rates is the lack of systematic ways of designing a candidate set, a listing of putative chemical identities that can be used during annotation. Relying on exiting databases is problematic as considering the large combinatorial space of molecular arrangements, there are many biologically relevant compounds not catalogued in databases or documented in the literature. A secondary yet important challenge is interpreting the measurements to understand the metabolic activity of the sample under study. Current techniques are limited in utilizing complex information about the sample to elucidate metabolic activity. The goal of this project is to develop computational techniques to advance the interpretation of large-scale metabolomics measurements. To address current challenges, we propose to pursue three Aims: (1) Engineering candidate sets that enhance biological discovery. (2) Developing new techniques for annotation including using deep learning and incremental build out methods to recommend novel chemical structures that best explain the measurements. (3) Constructing probabilistic models to analyze metabolic activity. Each technique will be rigorously validated computationally and experimentally using chemical standards. Two detailed case studies on the intestinal microbiota will allow us to further validate our tools. Microbiota-derived metabolites have been detected in circulation and shown to engage host cellular pathways in organs and tissues beyond the digestive system. Identifying these metabolites is thus critical for understanding the metabolic function of the microbiota and elucidating their mechanisms. The complex test cases will challenge our techniques, provide feedback during development, and allow us to further disseminate our techniques. We will work closely with early adopters of our tools, as proposed in supporting letters, to further validate our tools and encourage wide adoption. All proposed tools will be open source and made accessible through the web. Our tools promise to change current practices in interpreting metabolomics data beyond what is currently possible with databases, current annotation tools, statistical and overrepresentation analysis, or combinations thereof. The use of machine learning and large data sets as proposed herein defines the most promising research direction in metabolomics analysis. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Untargeted Metabolomics is a recently developed technique that allows the measurement of thousands of molecules in a biological sample. This work proposes several novel computational techniques that address limitations of current metabolomics analysis tools. We anticipate that this work will advance discoveries in biomedical research and have direct benefits to human health.",Computational Techniques for Advancing Untargeted Metabolomics Analysis,10242075,R01GM132391,"['Adoption ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Circulation ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' gastrointestinal system ', ' Ailmentary System ', ' Alimentary System ', ' Digestive System ', ' Gastrointestinal Body System ', ' Gastrointestinal Organ System ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Intestines ', ' Intestinal ', ' bowel ', ' Literature ', ' Maps ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Molecular Structure ', ' Macromolecular Structure ', ' nutrition ', ' Play ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Public Domains ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Label ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Chemicals ', ' Chemical Structure ', ' Training ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Measurement ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Letters ', ' Metabolic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' physical property ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' drug development ', ' drug discovery ', ' MeSH ', ' Medical Subject Headings ', ' MeSH Thesaurus ', ' PubMed ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' small molecule ', ' chemical standard ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Validation ', ' Nutritional ', ' nutritious ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' PubChem ', ' cost ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Consumption ', ' combinatorial ', ' open source ', ' gut microbiota ', ' GI microbiota ', ' Gastrointestinal microbiota ', ' enteric microbial community ', ' enteric microbiota ', ' gastrointestinal microbial flora ', ' gut commensal ', ' gut community ', ' gut flora ', ' gut microbe community ', ' gut microbial community ', ' gut microbial composition ', ' gut microbial consortia ', ' gut microbiotic ', ' gut microflora ', ' intestinal flora ', ' intestinal microbes ', ' intestinal microbiota ', ' intestinal microflora ', ' intestinal tract microflora ', ' dark matter ', ' biomarker discovery ', ' metabolome ', ' metabonome ', ' microbiota ', ' microbial consortia ', ' microbial flora ', ' microflora ', ' multispecies consortia ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' annotation  system ', ' annotation framework ', ' annotation tool ', ' microbiota metabolites ', ' microbiota derived metabolites ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' ']",NIGMS,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,R01,2021,372055,MA-07
"Identification of the Components of Frailty Using Administrative Data and Metabolite Profiling PROJECT SUMMARY Candidate: Dr. Strom received an MD from Harvard Medical School (HMS), and has completed clinical training in internal medicine (MGH), cardiology (BIDMC), and non-invasive cardiac imaging (BIDMC). Additionally, he completed an MSc in Epidemiology program at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, in May, 2018. He is now a junior faculty member at BIDMC with 75% protected time to conduct clinical research. Through this proposed 5-year program, Dr. Strom will pursue additional training in advanced prediction modeling, machine learning, patient-oriented research, and metabolomics. The candidate’s long- term goal is to become an R01-funded investigator in the area of applied outcomes research. Environment: The candidate will be mentored by Robert W. Yeh (Primary Mentor), Associate Professor of Medicine at HMS and Director of the Smith Center for Outcomes Research in Cardiology, Robert E. Gerszten (Co-Mentor), Professor of Medicine at HMS and Chief of Cardiovascular Medicine at BIDMC, and Changyu Shen (Co-Mentor), upcoming Associate Professor of Medicine at HMS and Lead Biostatistician for the Smith Center. Dr. Yeh has a track record of leading practice-changing studies and successful mentorship of clinician investigators. Dr. Gerszten is an internationally recognized expert in molecular phenotyping of cardiovascular diseases using metabolomics and proteomics and has mentored several K-award and R01 funded clinical investigators. Dr. Shen has a long track record of NIH funding, expertise in evaluating heterogeneity of treatment effect in cardiovascular diseases, and has mentored multiple prior trainees. Research: The optimal therapy for a given individual with aortic stenosis remains uncertain. This proposal seeks to define the clinical and biologic components of frailty that modify risk after aortic valve replacement (AVR) and alter treatment benefit. For Aims 1-2, we will leverage the unique linkage of Medicare data to the US CoreValve Pivotal trials, a collection of clinical trials that randomized individuals with severe aortic stenosis to transcatheter AVR (TAVR) with a self-expanding bioprosthesis vs. surgical AVR (SAVR). In Aim 1, we will we will identify which variables, related to in-person assessments of frailty and candidate frailty codes, best predict adverse outcomes after AVR. In Aim 2, we will identify if novel variables identified in Aim 1, identify a heterogeneous treatment response in individuals undergoing AVR. In Aim 3, we will prospectively enroll patients undergoing TAVR at BIDMC with concurrent frailty phenotyping to identify whether metabolites associated with longevity correlate with frailty and predict adverse outcomes, independent of age and comorbidities. The research will identify the mechanisms by which frailty confers adverse risk and differential treatment benefit in AVR, providing insights that may personalize treatment selection and improve patient care. PROJECT NARRATIVE While new technologies have permitted the use of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) as an alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for patients with severe aortic stenosis, which is fatal without treatment, deciding on the optimal treatment for a given patient is often difficult, especially as these decisions are often made towards the end of life and there are significant risks concomitant with each treatment. In this setting, frailty, a state of debility that impairs recovery from illness, has emerged as a significant risk factor for adverse outcomes but the mechanisms by which frailty confers risk and the components of frailty that are most important are unknown. In this proposal, we seek to define the clinical and biological components of frailty that contribute risk in aortic valve replacement using a combination of novel data sources and methodologic techniques, including linkage of clinical trials to administrative data, machine learning, and metabolite profiling, in order to personalize treatments and optimize patient health and medical decision
