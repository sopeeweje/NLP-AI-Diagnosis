"Clinical prediction and epigenetic regulation of asthma and rhinitis Asthma and rhinitis share a strong genetic component and are the most common chronic respiratory diseases worldwide affecting 339 million and 500 million people, respectively. Both allergic and non-allergic rhinitis are well-studied risk factors for the development of asthma, independent of atopy and IgE sensitization, and up to 80% of asthmatics have concomitant rhinitis. Conversely, asthma is also a risk factor for the development of rhinitis suggesting a common pathophysiological link between the upper and lower airways. Individuals with comorbid asthma and rhinitis are more likely to experience frequent and severe asthma exacerbations. Currently, an unmet need exists in the understanding of the comorbid development of asthma and rhinitis, including which patients are at risk and why patients with comorbid disease have increased disease severity. microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as important predictive biomarkers and regulators of the pathogenesis of asthma and rhinitis. However, the role of miRNA-messenger RNA (mRNA) regulatory networks in asthma with comorbid rhinitis is not known. The overall hypothesis of this K23 award proposal is that the comorbid development of asthma and rhinitis can be predicted by clinical factors and is regulated by miRNA-mRNA networks. Specific Aim 1 will evaluate the early childhood clinical prediction of the development of comorbid disease in the Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART) and Children, Allergy, Milieu, Stockholm, Epidemiology (BAMSE) cohorts and create a validated clinical prognostic tool to identify high-risk children who may benefit from early monitoring and interventions. Specific Aim 2 will identify the unique miRNA-mRNA pathways and regulatory networks in the peripheral blood that regulate asthma with comorbid rhinitis in children from the VDAART, BAMSE, and Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP) cohorts to identify candidate miRNAs and biological pathways that may serve as future targets of miRNA-based therapies and biomarkers. Specific Aim 3 will prospectively validate the miRNA-mRNA signature of asthma with comorbid rhinitis across the peripheral whole blood and local nasal epithelium in subjects recruited from Brigham and Women’s Hospital to identify the shared and tissue-specific pathogenic pathways in the peripheral blood and local primary airway tissue. Through this K23 award proposal, the candidate will complete an integrated plan of mentorship, coursework, conferences, patient-oriented research, statistical and computational analyses, manuscript submissions, and R01 grant preparation. She will develop new knowledge and skills in clinical, translational, and computational research and generate new hypotheses and data that will provide the basis for future independent lines of investigation. With the support of her division, mentors, and scientific advisory committee and the resources available at her institution, the candidate is ideally positioned to achieve her goal of becoming a successful independent investigator in the epidemiology and epigenetics of asthma and allergic diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Asthma and rhinitis frequently coexist and are the most common respiratory diseases globally, yet it remains unknown why these two diseases often develop concomitantly and why patients with comorbid disease have worse control of asthma symptoms and more frequent and severe asthma exacerbations. This proposal aims improve our understanding of the clinical risk factors and biological regulation of comorbid disease in order to facilitate the identification of high-risk patients, prognostic biomarkers, and novel therapeutic targets.",Clinical prediction and epigenetic regulation of asthma and rhinitis,10127279,K23HL151819,"['Affect ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Child ', ' 0-11

"Sociomarkers to Predict Asthma Control and Emergency Room Visits (SPACER) PROJECT ABSTRACT Asthma impacts more than 25 million adults and children in the U.S. with high associated morbidity and socioeconomic disparities in outcomes. Because effective medications are available to treat and prevent exacerbations of asthma and evidence-based interventions exist to mitigate the impact of harmful socioeconomic factors, early identification of those at highest risk is crucial. However, efforts to predict future exacerbations of asthma have yielded modest results with infrequent inclusion of comprehensive information on social hardships, such as food insecurity and housing instability, or financial hardships, such as difficulty affording the costs of controller medications which is particularly relevant for those with private health insurance. Identifying social and financial hardships requires broad-based screenings which are resource intensive, difficult to implement in clinical settings and often incomplete or limited to care seeking populations. Further, few asthma risk prediction modalities incorporate time-variable (temporal) data on important social, clinical, and environmental factors. Machine learning, an advanced computational approach to risk prediction, has great potential to improve upon conventional approaches to risk prediction of asthma exacerbations through indirect estimation of social hardships and inclusion of temporal risk factors. Implementation of enhanced asthma risk-prediction models in a health plan setting offers distinct advantages due to existing investments in asthma care management and access to timely claims data across the full care continuum. Accordingly, the aims of the SPACER study (Sociomarkers to Predict Asthma Control and Emergency Room visits) are 1) To describe social and financial hardships in privately insured adults and children with asthma, and association with medication adherence and exacerbations, 2) To indirectly estimate self-reported social and financial hardships using routinely collected health plan and spatial data, and 3) To develop and validate a machine learning network model, incorporating temporal sociomarker, clinical, and environmental data, to predict asthma exacerbations in a health plan setting. The research leverages the unique research environment of the Department of Population Medicine, an academic research department of Harvard Medical School, situated in a regional non-profit health plan, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care. The mentored career development award will support Dr. Alon Peltz, a physician and health services researcher, in developing expertise in machine learning modeling and use of social data to improve prediction of adverse clinical outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this proposal is to develop new methods for asthma risk prediction in a health plan setting by incorporating social and financial hardship data, temporal features, and machine learning. Applications of this research will directly enable U.S. health plans to better identify adults and children for enrollment in asthma care management programs in order to moderate their combined clinical and social risks for poor asthma quality. This career development award will support Dr. Alon Peltz, a physician health services researcher, in developing expertise in machine learning risk prediction incorporating expanded social data.",Sociomarkers to Predict Asthma Control and Emergency Room Visits (SPACER),10099714,K23HL155425,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Award ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environment ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health Services ', ' Incentives ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Investments ', ' Learning ', ' Medicaid ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Privatization ', ' Public Policy ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' socio-economic factors ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' experience ', ' care seeking ', ' skills ', ' health record ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Modality ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' medication compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' housing instability ', ' instably housed ', ' unstable housing ', ' unstably housed ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' network models ', ' high risk ', ' clinical risk ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' socio-economic disparity ', ' disparities in morbidity ', ' morbidity disparities ', ' relative cost ', ' health plan ', ' health plans ', ' random forest ', ' risk prediction model ', ' food insecurity ', ' asthma exacerbation ', ' asthma attack ', ' exacerbation in asthma ', ' exacerbation prone asthma ', ' exacerbation prone asthmatic ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' financial burden ', ' financial distress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial stress ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NHLBI,"HARVARD PILGRIM HEALTH CARE, INC.",K23,2021,169332,MA-07
"Data, Modeling,and Coordination Center for PrecISE Network ABSTRACT The goal of this U24 application is to establish the Data, Modeling, and Coordination Center (DMCC) for the NHLBI's Precision Interventions for Severe and/or Exacerbation-Prone Asthma (PrecISE) Network. The objective of PrecISE is to conduct sequential, adaptive, phase II/proof of concept trials with precision interventions in stratified patient with severe asthma populations. Patients with severe asthma are heterogeneous, and thus a hard to treat population. Precision medicine interventions, which focus on identifying the best treatments for individual patients instead of the best treatments for the most patients, could improve overall outcomes among this complex patient population. The PrecISE Network is poised to address these issues. Central to its success will be an innovative, forward-looking, and productive Coordinating Center that brings cohesion to the participating Clinical Center investigators by sharing their visions and providing scientific leadership, organizational support and analytic results for PrecISE trials. Key elements that will enhance collaboration and research progress include experienced leadership, innovative design and analysis methodologies (e.g., sequential adaptive designs, machine learning, neural networks, Q-learning), comprehensive research operations support, a state-of-the-art data management system, and superior administrative support. Our infrastructure will provide both public and private websites which include PrecISE information pages for the public, participants, and investigators, frequently asked questions, study materials, project calendar, a communications hub, and other key features. We will develop a secure, user-friendly advanced data management system that includes web-based access for surveys, data entry, research management (including comprehensive reporting, biosample tracking and performance-based reimbursement tools), integration with external applications, and quality control. Our research operations and administration teams will provide a solid foundation to PrecISE by facilitating communication including meeting arrangements and minutes, collaborative document preparation, tracking of regulatory compliance, and support for abstract and publication preparation across the PrecISE Network. Together, this integrated structure will set the stage for the execution of high-impact, sequential, adaptive, phase II/proof of concept trials in the PrecISE Network, which can lead to the establishment of potential personalized treatment approaches for patients with severe and/or exacerbation-prone asthma. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe asthma affects 10% of people worldwide, and despite currently available treatments, asthma remains poorly controlled for many patients. The National Institutes of Health is funding a new iteration of previous high- impact asthma clinical trials networks, which will take a personalized medicine approach to identify new therapies for severe asthma, tailored to an individual patient using data-based treatment algorithms that leverage information on his/her individual disease and treatment history. Our proposal is to provide leadership and statistical research support to this network.","Data, Modeling,and Coordination Center for PrecISE Network",10191006,U24HL138998,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old

"Identification of Early Metabolomic and Immune Endotypes of Allergy and Asthma: An Integrated Multiomics Approach PROJECT SUMMARY Metabolic dysregulation due to in utero and early-life environmental exposures has lasting consequences on the developing immune system and lung and that these changes underlie the pathobiology of childhood atopy and wheeze. However, significant gaps remain in understanding the dysregulated metabolic-immune pathways and mechanisms involved in early childhood atopy and wheeze. Our preliminary study of the infant untargeted metabolome demonstrated that dysregulation in the unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) and lipid mediator's pathway are associated with number of wheeze episodes in a dose-response manner, which suggests the involvement of endogenous antioxidant and lipid mediator pathways. In another preliminary study of the infant immunome, we demonstrated that two distinct infant immune response profiles to acute respiratory infection, with an immune response pattern characterized by increased Type-2 and Type-17 and decreased non-interferon Type- 1 immune responses to with increased risk of recurrent wheeze. While these single omics studies can identify dysregulated metabolites and immune-responses in wheeze phenotypes, they alone fail to capture the full spectrum of underlying pathobiology. The integration of omics data has advanced the understanding of other chronic disease pathogenesis, as it is likely to do for childhood atopy and wheeze. Therefore, we hypothesize that the integration of early-life metabolome (including lipidome) and immunome can elucidate molecular pathways relevant to atopy and wheeze development. To test this hypothesis, the candidate will capitalize on existing carefully phenotyped population-based birth cohort of healthy infants (INSPIRE) and a replication cohort from the NIH ECHO initiative (ECHO-CREW asthma consortium) and accomplish the following specific aims: 1) To investigate whether increased unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) levels reduce early life atopy and wheeze incidence by enhancing the bioavailability of pro-resolving lipid mediators and antioxidants and decreasing pro-inflammatory lipid mediators, 2) To discover novel immunome profiles and network modules that characterize atopy and wheeze phenotypes, and 3) To uncover novel metabolic-immune molecular pathways associated with the development of atopy and wheeze phenotypes by integrating metabolome and immunome data. Successful completion of these aims will: (1) provide novel insights into the role of the early- life metabolome and immunome in the pathogenesis of atopy and wheeze and (2) identify targets for disease prevention. The proposal builds on the candidate's previous work, expertise, and interest in systems approaches to understand disease development. The goal of this career development proposal is for the candidate to emerge as an independent investigator in the field of asthma and allergy with unique knowledge and application of systems approaches to understand disease mechanisms. The candidate is in an outstanding academic environment, has a well thought out training and research plan, which will propel him into an independent expert in the field of immuno-metabolism of atopy and asthma. PROJECT NARRATIVE Early life metabolic dysregulation has lasting consequences on the developing infant immune system and lung, and these changes likely underlie the pathobiology of childhood atopy and wheeze (an early manifestation of allergy and asthma). Knowledge gaps remain in understanding the pathobiological mechanisms of atopy and wheeze phenotypes, which the proposed study aims to address by computationally integrating metabolome and immune response data to identify molecular pathways relevant to the pathobiology of atopic and wheeze phenotypes. Biomarker and pathway identification will aid in identifying targets for primary prevention of allergy and asthma syndromes in the pediatric population, which is of high public health priority.",Identification of Early Metabolomic and Immune Endotypes of Allergy and Asthma: An Integrated Multiomics Approach,10239084,K01HL149989,"['Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', ' Anti-Inflammatories ', ' Anti-inflammatory ', ' Antiinflammatories ', ' Antiinflammatory Agents ', ' antiinflammatory ', ' Antioxidants ', ' anti-oxidant ', ' Arachidonic Acids ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Bilirubin ', ' Bilirubin IX alpha ', ' Biological Availability ', ' Bioavailability ', ' Biologic Availability ', ' Physiologic Availability ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Fatty Acids ', ' Feces ', ' stool ', ' Goals ', ' Heme ', ' Ferroprotoporphyrin ', ' Protoheme ', ' ferroheme ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Allergy ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Incidence ', ' Infant ', ' Inflammation ', ' Lipids ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nose ', ' Nasal ', ' Nasal Passages Nose ', ' Respiratory System, Nose, Nasal Passages ', ' oxidation ', ' Phenotype ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' statistics ', ' Supervision ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Wheezing ', ' wheeze ', ' Work ', ' Training ', ' infancy ', ' infantile ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' insight ', ' Development Plans ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Metabolic ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Acute respiratory infection ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Atopic Allergy ', ' atopic triad ', ' atopy ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' lipid mediator ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Early identification ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' career development ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' in utero ', ' airway inflammation ', ' airway epithelium inflammation ', ' Lung Inflammation ', ' Population ', ' two-dimensional ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' population based ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' public health priorities ', ' learning network ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' metabolome ', ' metabonome ', ' molecular subtypes ', ' expression subtypes ', ' molecular sub-types ', ' molecular subsets ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' lipidome ', ' ']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,K01,2021,161835,TN-05
"Multi-Omics Analysis of the Association of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids with Asthma and Allergy in Childhood PROJECT SUMMARY This K08 proposal describes a comprehensive training program tailored to the career development of the candidate. The candidate is a physician who recently completed a clinical fellowship in Allergy and Immunology and whose research contributions to date have addressed early-life risk factors for childhood asthma and allergy with a focus on the diet and intestinal microenvironment. Asthma and environmental allergies have increased in prevalence and asthma is now the most common chronic disease in children. The increased occurrence of asthma and allergy has been attributed to changes including dietary shifts and dysbiosis, though contributory factors are incompletely defined and interventions to prevent asthma and allergy remain elusive. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), including omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids (FA) have well-defined immunologic effects, and the ratio of omega-6:omega-3 FA intake has increased concurrently with the increase in allergic disease. However, reported associations of PUFA with asthma and allergy in childhood are inconsistent. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that effects of PUFA are impacted by host genotype and the intestinal microbiota. Our scientific goal is to examine these omics to identify determinants of when a safe and inexpensive intervention, intake of PUFA, is effective in reducing asthma and allergy in childhood. We will utilize data from 6- and 7-year-old participants in three study populations: Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART), Project Viva and Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010 (COPSAC). We have three specific aims: (1) Identify gene by omega-3 FA interactions in asthma and allergy in childhood; (2): Define the contributions of intestinal bacteria and metabolites to associations of omega-3 FA dietary intake with asthma and allergy in childhood; and (3) Characterize clinically relevant childhood plasma PUFA profiles using unsupervised classification methods and integrative machine learning algorithms. Our findings could lead to cost-effective and personalized approaches to asthma and allergy reduction by elucidating which individuals benefit from dietary PUFA supplementation and whether microbiota-modifying therapies could boost protective responses to PUFA. The candidate proposes to execute this research plan alongside a training and development plan including hands-on bioinformatics instruction and preparation for independent mechanistic and clinical R01-level follow-up projects. The proposed work will be mentored by Dr. Scott Weiss, a Professor at Harvard Medical School and a leader in environmental, nutritional and genetic asthma risk factors. The candidate will obtain additional scientific input and career guidance from a team including a co-mentor and three scientific advisors with expertise in asthma epidemiology, lipid mediators of allergic inflammation, multi-omics analysis and translational research methods. This proposal represents a natural continuation of the candidate’s prior experience and will provided the support needed for her to become an independent investigator with a focus on precision medicine approaches to asthma and allergy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are dietary fats with effects on immune function and inflammation, and the genes that a person is born with or the bacteria that live in one’s gut could influence how the body processes and responds to PUFA. We will study children to see if having particular gene variants or specific gut bacteria or chemicals impacts how PUFA intake relates to risk of asthma and allergy. Understanding how genetic, microbial, and other factors influence PUFA processing and asthma and allergies could lead to new cost- effective ways to prevent and treat these increasingly common and clinically burdensome diseases.",Multi-Omics Analysis of the Association of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids with Asthma and Allergy in Childhood,10246291,K08HL148178,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', '

"Using Computational Approaches to Optimize Asthma Care Management Abstract  The study will develop more accurate, computational predictive models and a novel automatic explanation function to better identify patients likely to benefit most from care management. For many chronic diseases, a small portion of patients with high vulnerabilities, severe disease, or great barriers to care consume most healthcare resources and costs. To improve outcomes and resource use, many healthcare systems use predictive models to prospectively identify high-risk patients and enroll them in care management to implement tailored care plans. For maximal benefit from costly care management with limited service capacity, only patients at the highest risk should be enrolled. But, current patient identification approaches have two limitations: 1) Low prediction accuracy causes misclassification, wasted costs, and suboptimal care. If an existing model  were used for care management allocation, enrollment would miss >50% of those who would benefit most  but include others unlikely to benefit. A healthcare system often has insufficient data for model training and  incomplete data on many patients. A typical model uses only a few risk factors for adverse outcomes, despite  many being known. Also, many predictive variables on patient and system characteristics are not found yet. 2) No explanation of the reasons for a prediction causes poor adoption of the prediction and busy care  managers to spend extra time and miss suitable interventions. Care managers need to understand why a  patient is predicted to be at high risk before allocating to care management and forming a tailored care plan.  Existing models rarely give such explanation, forcing care managers to do detailed patient chart reviews.  To address the limitations and optimize care management for more high-risk patients to receive appropriate care, the study will: a) improve accuracy of computationally identifying high-risk patients and assess potential impact on outcomes; b) automate explanation of computational prediction results and assess impact on model accuracy and outcomes; c) assess automatic explanations' impact on care managers' acceptance of the predictions and perceived care plan quality. The use case will be asthma that affects 9% of Americans and incurs 439,000 hospitalizations, 1.8 million emergency room visits, and $56 billion in cost annually. Asthma experts and computer scientists will use data from three leading healthcare systems; a novel, model-based transfer learning technique needing no other system's raw data; a novel, pattern-based automatic explanation technique that also improves model generalizability and accuracy; a new data source PreManage to make patient data more complete; and novel features on patient and system characteristics. These techniques can advance clinical machine learning for various applications, improve patient identification, and help form tailored care plans. Focus groups will be conducted with clinicians to explore generalizing the techniques to patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, and heart diseases, on whom care management is also needed. The results will potentially transform care management for better outcomes and more efficient resource use. Narrative  Care management is widely used in managing asthma patients. The proposed new techniques will boost the performance of patient identification and care plan development for care management, leading to improved clinical outcomes and more efficient healthcare resource use.",Using Computational Approaches to Optimize Asthma Care Management,10176558,R01HL142503,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Air ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' California ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' Computers ', ' Costs and Benefits ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' services research ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease ', ' COPD ', ' Chronic Obstruction Pulmonary Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Patient Care Planning ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', "" Physicians' Offices "", ' Publishing ', ' Records ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Time ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Weather ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Development Plans ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scientist ', ' Hour ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' computer science ', ' simulation ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Care Manager ', ' Case Management Nurse ', ' Case Manager ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Drops ', ' Health Informatics ', ' consumer informatics ', ' Public Health Informatics ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Characteristics ', ' cost ', ' asthmatic patient ', ' asthma patient ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Consumption ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Patient risk ', ' individual patient ', ' improved outcome ', ' care costs ', ' barrier to care ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' acute care ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,775715,WA-07
"IL-18 Signaling and Lung Epithelial Cell Barrier Integrity in Severe Asthma PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:  Asthma is a common disease, affecting more than 300 million people worldwide. Though well controlled in most, some experience disease that is refractory to standard treatments such as corticosteroids. Recent efforts focused on understanding these severe asthma (SA) patients suggests ontological heterogeneity. Previous work from the Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP) cohort linked epithelial gene signature to clinical phenotype. We revisited this data set and identified 3 novel groups of asthmatics, one of which housing the majority of SA cases and having the worst lung function and greatest exacerbation history. Using principal drivers of variance in the data set, we found that expression of the interleukin 18 receptor (IL18R1) along with 18 other genes was able identify at-risk asthmatics. IL18R1 has been previously linked to asthma in genome-wide association studies. Its ligand, interleukin-18 (IL-18), may be a cofactor for both Th1 and Th2 inflammation. High IL-18 levels have been detected in serum and sputum of asthmatics including in those with fatal asthma. Importantly, IL-18 and IL18R1 regulate epithelial barrier function in other inflammatory conditions. We have confirmed an increase in IL18R1 at the protein level in SA patients compared to healthy controls (HC) using lung biopsies from very severe asthma cases. These SA patients also harbor increased numbers IL-18+ cells, the cognate ligand for IL18R1. Downstream targets of IL18 stimulation, including the active phosphorylated forms of JNK1 and c-Jun, show increase in SA airway epithelium. SA patients also show disorganization of adherens junctions, suggesting breakdown in epithelial barrier integrity.  Based on this background and our preliminary data, we hypothesize that IL-18 pathway activation, via elevated IL18R1 expression in bronchial epithelium, promotes dysregulated barrier function that contributes to SA pathobiology by increasing immune cell access to foreign antigens. We propose 2 aims to address this: Aim 1. We will interrogate pre-existing tissue banks for quantitative analysis of IL18R1 and compare that with levels of its ligand in tissue and fluids from these patients. These data will be corroborated with activity of associated signaling pathways and tight/adherens junction integrity. Aim 2. We will us primary human airway epithelial cells, obtained bronchoscopically from HCs and asthmatic patients to mechanistically confirm and expand upon the results from Aim 1. This will include validation of ex vivo results as well as quantification of barrier function.  These data will identify a novel role for IL18 in severe asthma pathogenesis and open up new avenues for treatment of this difficult and costly disease. The activities of the project will provide the PI with valuable experience in obtaining, culturing and manipulating primary human airway epithelial cells and lay the foundation for future in vivo work by integrating study in computational biology and immunology. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Severe asthma is disease with tremendous impact on patient quality of life and significant cost of treatment. We have used machine learning to identify the IL-18 pathway as a potential driver of this disease which may one day be targeted for novel treatments. Thus, we propose confirmation of these findings using an extensive ex vivo tissue collection as well as mechanistic validation using primary human airway epithelial cells to lay groundwork for future in vivo study.",IL-18 Signaling and Lung Epithelial Cell Barrier Integrity in Severe Asthma,10116175,F32HL147415,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones ', ' Corticoids ', ' Corticosteroids ', ' Affect ', ' Air ',

"Integrative metabolomic characterization of ADHD and asthma comorbidity PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Su H. Chu, PhD, MS is a biostatistician and molecular epidemiologist with strong and substantial commitments to integrative omic research in respiratory and neurodevelopmental disease. Her career objective is to become an independent investigator with expertise in developing and applying novel statistical methods and multiomic network approaches that facilitate mechanistic understanding of the intersection of respiratory and neurodevelopmental disease. This proposal combines Dr. Chu’s extensive training in integrative omic methods development, along with her experience in genetic and metabolomic research, to examine the integrative metabolomic etiology of asthma and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder overlap (AAO). A wealth of epidemiological literature has revealed with remarkable consistency that asthmatic patients are at greater risk for ADHD, and vice versa, with a number of longitudinal studies of childhood asthma indicating excess risk of ADHD in adolescence and adulthood. However, no studies have directly interrogated the biological mechanisms by which these conditions may be related. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that childhood asthma and ADHD share both common and distinct dysregulated metabolic processes, some of which may have drivers that are genetic in origin. This will be explored using existing genetic and metabolomic data from the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP), the Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART), and the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010 (COPSAC), three large prospective cohorts of children with extensive longitudinal phenotyping and multiple omic data types, by identifying metabolites and metabolic profiles associated with AAO (aim 1), constructing multiomic models and features that characterize dysregulated metabolic processes and their upstream drivers in AAO (aim 2), and validation and replication of all findings (aim 3). As Dr. Chu completes these aims, her career development program will facilitate the achievement of her primary training goals: 1) increase clinical understanding of ADHD and asthma diagnosis and treatment; 2) gain a nuanced understanding of best methods for, and practical experience in, the biological and statistical integration of genetic and metabolomic data; 3) develop skills in machine learning and integrative network methods for multiomic analysis; 4) strengthen current areas of experience to stay on the cutting edge of new analytic and study design techniques; and 5) enhance skills in mentorship, teaching, and the responsible conduct and communication of research. The support of a diverse mentoring team comprised of world experts in the fields of asthma and psychiatric genetics, metabolomics, integrative omics, and statistics, along with her strong quantitative training and the vibrant intellectual community of Harvard Medical School and the Brigham and Women’s Hospital, ensure the success of this proposal. Finally, this research will use state-of-the-art multiomic techniques to lay the initial groundwork for understanding the pathobiology of asthma and ADHD comorbidity, a major and well-established public health concern, from which new research programs will emerge. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although a rich epidemiological literature has demonstrated a high comorbidity between asthma, the most common respiratory disease worldwide, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the most common behavioral disorder among children, with reports of significant increases in diagnoses in recent years, no studies have interrogated the potential molecular pathobiology underlying the mutual excess risk between asthma and ADHD. This proposal aims to use integrative techniques by combining genetic and metabolomic data to characterize common and distinct mechanisms and pathways of dysregulated metabolism in the presence of comorbid asthma and ADHD and to develop multiomic profiles which can assist in predicting higher risk of ADHD among asthmatic children. The findings from this study will be instrumental in understanding the molecular underpinnings of two highly prevalent public health concerns, and this study will be the first of its kind to interrogate the molecular intersections between asthma and ADHD.",Integrative metabolomic characterization of ADHD and asthma comorbidity,10224338,K01HL153941,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior Disorders ', ' behavioral disorder ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Joints ', ' Libraries ', ' Literature ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' disease of the lung ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Program Development ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Respiration Disorders ', ' Respiratory Disorder ', ' breathing disorder ', ' respiratory dysfunction ', ' Risk ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Sphingolipids ', ' statistics ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Tryptophan ', ' L-Tryptophan ', ' Levotryptophan ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Vitamin D ', ' VIT D ', ' Woman ', ' Mediating ', ' psychogenetics ', ' psychiatric genetics ', ' career ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' inattentiveness ', ' inattention ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' respiratory ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' Reporting ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' theories ', ' AD/HD ', ' ADHD ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' small molecule ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' K01 Award ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Program ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Communication Research ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' asthmatic patient ', ' asthma patient ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' high risk ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' biological systems ', ' screening ', ' asthmatic ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' Formulation ', ' metabolic phenotype ', ' metabotype ', ' metabolic profile ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' antenatal ', ' antepartum ', ' Multiomic Data ', ' multiple omic data ', ' genetic testing ', ' gene testing ', ' gene-based testing ', ' Hyperactivity ', ' ']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2021,178200,MA-07
"Obesity dysregulates immune and metabolic status in asthma and alters infection susceptibility. Project abstract Asthma and obesity are two of the most common chronic diseases of childhood and are increasing in prevalence in the US and worldwide. Obesity and asthma are linked: as body mass index increases, the risk of asthma also increases. Asthma is not a single disease, but a group of overlapping phenotypes caused by multiple distinct molecular mechanisms, many of which remain undefined. Obese asthmatics have a severe phenotype of asthma that is poorly responsive to standard medication regimens and often characterized by more severe exacerbations, most of which are due to viral infections. However, the underlying immunometabolic mechanism leading to immune dysfunction in obese asthma remains unclear. To address this and establish testable hypotheses, I conducted a pilot study of pediatric asthmatics (A), obese asthmatics (OA), obese (O) and healthy control (HC) patients using multiple high dimensional assays, including mass cytometry, metabolomics and serum cytokine measurements. This study showed that obese asthmatics have two forms of immune dysregulation that may impair anti-viral responses: increased type 2 immunity and CD8 T cell exhaustion. In addition, OA patients have alterations in serum metabolites, including increased levels of glutamate, which may underlie some of these alterations in T cell state. Here, I intend to tackle the fundamental and tractable question of the nature of immune dysregulation in obese asthma by testing hypotheses derived from my human data using relevant mouse models of disease. First, I will test whether elevated levels of serum glutamate, a serum metabolite increased in OA patients, directly increases type 2 immunity (Aim 1). Second, I will confirm the presence of increased CD8 T cell exhaustion in a mouse model of OA and assess the impact of T cell exhaustion on influenza infection by measuring the impact of abrogating a core exhaustion pathway, the PD-1 pathway (Aim 2). Both aims will utilize novel techniques, including mass cytometry and immunometabolic studies. I will receive training in bioinformatics and biostatistical approaches to systems immunology, including machine learning, that will allow me to gain insight into these comprehensive, multifaceted datasets to establish the core pathways and targets that should be pursued as therapeutic targets in these complex patients. My proposal outlines a 5-year training program for my development as a physician-scientist in Pediatric Allergy Immunology. In particular, I will focus on gaining additional expertise in cutting-edge mass cytometry and systems immunology data analysis techniques, as well as mouse models of asthma and obesity. This will allow me to integrate complex human and mouse datasets, generating and testing mechanistic hypotheses with direct clinical applicability. I believe my training plan, within the remarkable environments in Dr. Wherry’s lab, CHOP and UPenn, will position me to become an independently funded physician scientist. Project Narrative Pediatric obese asthma is a severe disease that responds poorly to standard asthma medications and has higher rates of more severe viral asthma flares. Here, I have used a combination of advanced experimental methods and cutting-edge data analysis tools to uncover possible causes of immune system dysfunction in obese asthma that may play important roles in their poor anti-viral responses. Based on my data from patients, I will use mouse models of obese asthma to test whether changes in serum metabolites or immune exhaustion are important causes of the immune dysfunction observed in

"Characterizing individual- and subtype-specific risk factors and treatments in asthma Project Summary/Abstract Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease affecting about 340 million people worldwide, yet its causal biology, environmental risks, key cell types, and optimal treatments remain under-characterized. This difficulty is partly due to clinical heterogeneity, as different risk factors drive asthma for different people. Asthma subtype studies have already begun to reveal important aspects of this heterogeneity. However, asthma subtypes remain nascent and ambiguous and have not yet realized their potential utility for scientific studies and precision treatments. In particular, genetics has not been fully exploited for asthma subtyping, though it has a unique ability to assess the causal biological significance of subtypes and can identify key cell types; conversely, prior subtyping studies are susceptible to coincidental subtypes that are not directly relevant to asthma biology. Furthermore, prior studies have used basic methods which are liable to bias and low power. To address these limitations, we will develop a powerful and robust framework to pinpoint and genetically characterize asthma subtypes, and we will broadly apply it in large, deeply phenotyped, and diverse cohorts. Our study will identify novel subtypes and their demographic, genomic, cellular, and clinical etiologies, which can suggest precision treatments and improve power and interpretation in basic and translational research. Our work will improve genetic prediction of asthma, particularly in understudied populations. Finally, our approach and freely released methods will provide a broad template for complex trait subtyping. To accomplish these goals, we will study four large biobanks, which offer unprecedented sample size, clinical depth, and demographic diversity. We will use functional genomics to link genetic heterogeneity to causal and cell type-specific molecular mechanisms. We will build on our prior machine learning tools to identify subtypes, quantify their genetic and clinical significance, and infer their dominant cell types. Our methods are unique by correcting for confounding population structure, which is crucial for genetic subtyping: spurious genetic associations led prior studies to propose severely biased and regressive nosology. A key goal of this proposal is the PI’s retraining in asthma biology, pulmonology, and functional genomics. This will be achieved by close mentorship from Professors Carole Ober, Julian Solway, Yoav Gilad, and Matthew Stephens, as well as didactic courses in the UChicago Department of Medicine and Institute for Translational Medicine. This retraining will maximize the biomedical impact of our study by enabling the PI to deeply connect quantitative results to core facets of asthma pathology and will establish the PI as an independent asthma researcher who can optimally apply his statistics and machine learning background to tackle essential biomedical hurdles. PROJECT NARRATIVE Asthma is a chronic and increasingly common disease, yet its causal etiology, environmental risks, key cell types, and optimal treatments remain largely unclear, which is partly due to asthma’s extreme heterogeneity. We will develop a powerful and robust machine learning model to identify and characterize genetic asthma subtypes, especially their specific cellular etiologies, in large, diverse, deeply phenotyped biobanks; these subtypes will improve power and interpretation in scientific studies and advance precision medicine. The PI’s retraining in respiratory biology and close mentorship from world experts will maximize the biomedical impact of our inferred genetic subtypes and establish the PI’s independent asthma research program.",Characterizing individual- and subtype-specific risk factors and treatments in asthma,10191398,K25HL157603,"['Affect ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Biology ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Institutes ', ' Learning ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' disease of the lung ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' neutrophil ', ' Blood Neutrophil ', ' Blood Polymorphonuclear Neutrophil ', ' Marrow Neutrophil ', ' Neutrophilic Granulocyte ', ' Neutrophilic Leukocyte ', ' Polymorphonuclear Cell ', ' Polymorphonuclear Leukocytes ', ' Polymorphonuclear Neutrophils ', ' Pathology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Pulmonology ', ' Pneumology ', ' Pneumonology ', ' Pulmonary Medicine ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Smoking ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Link ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Genetic Heterogeneity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' respiratory ', ' Gene x Environment Interaction ', ' GxE interaction ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' professor ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' Proxy ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' disorder classification ', ' nosology ', ' disease classification ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' functional genomics ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' genetic association ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Molecular ', ' sex ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Heritability ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' translational medicine ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' Precision therapeutics ', ' precision therapies ', ' precision treatment ', ' Genotype-Tissue Expression Project ', ' GTEx ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' clinical heterogeneity ', ' optimal treatments ', ' optimal therapies ', ' clinical subtypes ', ' asthma exacerbation ', ' asthma attack ', ' exacerbation in asthma ', ' exacerbation prone asthma ', ' exacerbation prone asthmatic ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' polygenic risk score ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K25,2021,140562,IL-01
"Feasibility of mHealth Technology for Improving Self-Management and Adherence Among Asthmatic Adolescents Asthma self‐management is essential for preventing exacerbations and reducing the burden of the disease. However, poor adherence to prescribed treatment and poor recognition of symptoms leads to reduced asthma control, particularly among adolescents. Studies show that adolescents lack understanding about self‐management, and that asthma education during clinic visits is deficient, resulting in insufficient asthma management. Mobile technology, specifically, mobile applications (or apps) are an efficient way to increase patient‐provider communication, provide feedback on asthma management, and deliver asthma education. Our pilot work has demonstrated that an app can be effective at improving asthma control in adolescents aged 12‐17, and that adolescents are enthusiastic about utilizing mHealth technologies for asthma management, but that existing apps are not engaging or appealing enough to an adolescent population to sustain long‐term use. For this pilot study, we will test the feasibility, acceptability, and adherence to a smartphone app for asthma self‐management in order to obtain data necessary to complete a future large efficacy trial of the app in adolescents with persistent asthma. The objective of this project is to use an agile, iterative, user‐centered design process to tailor our existing proof of concept app to adolescent user preferences and to use a mixed‐ methods approach to test feasibility, acceptability, adherence, and preliminary efficacy. The long‐term goal is to identify mHealth technological approaches that facilitate self‐management of chronic diseases, particularly among adolescents, and to develop marketing strategies to promote long‐term support of these approaches. The rationale for this project is that adolescents are quick to adopt mobile technologies, have a high degree of smartphone use, and are at a point of transition from parental management of their chronic condition to self‐ management, making this a priority population for the development of interventions targeting asthma control. For this project, we have two specific aims: 1) To refine an asthma self‐management app for adolescents with persistent asthma; and 2) To assess feasibility, acceptability, and adherence to the app in a small randomized controlled trial. The approach is innovative because we are incorporating a user‐centered design process to integrate multiple components for facilitating asthma self‐management in a mHealth tool tailored for adolescents within the Technology Acceptance Model framework. Despite studies showing that mHealth tools can be effective, few have prioritized an adolescent audience or evaluated the tool compared to standard of care using rigorous, mixed‐method approaches. This research is significant because asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood in the US and the prevalence of the condition continues to rise, and so innovative tools to improve self‐management of the disease are critically needed. Asthma is the most common chronic disease in childhood, which makes the proposed research a significant public health burden. This pilot is designed to test the feasibility, acceptability, and adherence to a smartphone app for asthma self-management among adolescents with persistent asthma. Knowledge gained from this pilot study will be used to design and conduct a future efficacy trial of the app. This project addresses the mission of NHLBI by developing a novel intervention to treat asthma. This study leverages our formative and pilot work to continue making strides towards enhancing asthma control among adolescents with persistent asthma in order to reduce asthma-related morbidity.",Feasibility of mHealth Technology for Improving Self-Management and Adherence Among Asthmatic Adolescents,10224318,R34HL145442,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' health care expenditure ', ' healthcare expenditure ', ' Feedback ', ' Florida ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Incentives ', ' Inhalators ', ' Inhaler ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' Smoking ', ' Social Change ', ' Social modification ', ' Social transformation ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' African American ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' Hispanics ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Self Management ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' insight ', ' Sample Size ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' Adopted ', ' Frequencies ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' preference ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Health Information System ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' peak flow measurement ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Monitor ', ' Teenagers ', ' Teen ', ' teen years ', ' teenage ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' user centered design ', ' iterative design ', ' therapy development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' patient population ', ' standard of care ', ' arm ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile device application ', ' asthmatic ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile technology ', ' recruit ', ' smartphone Application ', ' Android App ', ' Android Application ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smartphone App ', ' iOS app ', ' iOS application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iPhone Application ', ' patient-clinician communication ', ' patient-doctor communication ', ' patient-provider communication ', ' asthma exacerbation ', ' asthma attack ', ' exacerbation in asthma ', ' exacerbation prone asthma ', ' exacerbation prone asthmatic ', ' acceptability and feasibility ', ' feasibility testing ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA,R34,2021,256469,FL-14
