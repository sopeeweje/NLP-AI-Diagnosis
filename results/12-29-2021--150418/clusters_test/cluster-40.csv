"Resolving single-cell brain regulatory elements with bulk data supervised models Gene regulation is an important determinant of the complex specialization of cells in the human brain, and nucleotide changes within regulatory elements contribute to risk for psychiatric disorders. We therefore hypothesize that these debilitating diseases are driven in part by genetic variants that alter gene expression and disturb the balance and function of cell types in brain tissue. Single-cell open chromatin assays are a promising approach to testing this hypothesis by mapping variants to regulatory elements specific to and shared across cell populations. There are two major barriers to this strategy, for which our project proposes modeling solutions. First, despite being the best assay currently, single-cell ATAC-sequencing (scATAC-seq) suffers from low resolution, meaning that an open chromatin region may be supported by zero or few reads in a given cell. This makes it hard to identify coherent cell populations. We propose a network model for semi-supervised clustering of cells in scATAC-seq that leverages information from higher-coverage bulk tissue experiments and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), if available. The expected outcomes from applying this model to compendia of brain data from public repositories and our collaborators are (i) identification of open chromatin regions that differentiate cell types and states, and (ii) discovery of resolved cell populations whose open chromatin is enriched for psychiatric disorder associated genetic variants. These results alone may not be enough to develop a mechanistic understanding of how variants impact brain function. To address this second challenge, we will implement a computationally efficient, machine-learning framework for predicting the specific regulatory functions of single-cell open chromatin regions from our network model and other approaches. Gene regulatory enhancers are particularly amenable to this approach, because high-throughput mouse transgenics and massively parallel reporter assays have generated enough validated enhancers for supervised learning. Our framework will be easy to apply to other regulatory functions, such as insulating boundaries in chromatin capture data. By developing a compressed, yet flexible, featurization of massive bulk and single-cell data compendia, we will enable rapid iteration with computationally intensive prediction algorithms to be applied to single-cell open chromatin regions. Our approach will also incorporate transfer learning from data-rich (e.g., postmortem or mouse brains) to data-poor settings (e.g., human late-gestation brains). We expect predicted regulatory elements to be more enriched for psychiatric disorder genetic risk, to provide mechanistic insight regarding how variants cause disease, and to be useful molecular tools. Together our two proposed computational approaches will leverage the complementary strengths of bulk and single-cell data to resolve regulatory elements that drive the exquisite diversity of cells in developing and adult brains towards mapping the non-coding contribution of psychiatric disease. The human brain is a complex tissue comprised of diverse cell types with distinct gene regulation and function, making it difficult to mechanistically link genetic mutations to differences in brain health. This project will develop a network model and machine-learning framework that leverage single-cell and bulk genomics data to identify genome sequences that control gene expression in specific cell populations and states. We hypothesize that these cell type resolved regulatory elements will shed light on how sequence variants outside protein-coding genes increase risk for psychiatric disorders.",Resolving single-cell

"Determining lineage decisions and gene regulatory networks governing the generation of key progenitor cell types during early human brain development Abstract The long term goal of this proposal is to quantitatively understand how gene regulatory networks (GRNs) generate the diversity of cell types during the development of the human brain. The focus of this proposal is to determine how key progenitor cell types that are uniquely enriched in humans are generated. Such an understanding is essential for uncovering the mechanisms of human developmental diseases. There are three challenges to achieving this goal: 1. Ethical issues in working with developing human tissue, 2. Computational and experimental techniques to determine the sequence of progenitor cell states and state transitions that give rise to the diversity of cell types, 3. the difficultly in building quantitative models of the gene regulatory networks in the absence of data to determine the thousands of biochemical constants. The approach of the proposal is to build the necessary computational, mathematical and experimental framework to overcome these challenges. To recapitulate early human brain development, the proposal will employ an in vitro human embryonic stem cell differentiation system. To obtain snapshots of the underlying gene regulatory network, high throughput single cell sequencing will be employed to obtain transcriptional profiles of thousands of single cells during the course of development. The challenge of inferring the sequence of cell states and cell state transitions will be overcome through a novel statistical method to obtain a joint probability distribution of the cell states, sequence of transitions and a key set of genes whose dynamics reflect these states and transitions. The inferences will be tested by mapping to in vivo data and using viral lineage tracing. The origins of forebrain and outer radial glial cells (oRG) progenitors uniquely enriched in the developing human forebrain will thus be determined. The challenge of building predictive models will be overcome by using methods from theoretical physics and ensemble modeling from statistics to build models that make probabilistic predictions. By using the available data as constraints on the model, the framework will extract joint probability distributions of all the parameters of the model. These distribution functions will then be used to produce probabilistic predictions about the responses of the underlying GRNs to perturbations. High probability predictions will be tested experimentally by perturbing gene expression and signaling during early brain development and the model will be iteratively improved. The success of this proposal will result in the first quantitative model of the gene regulatory network controlling the generation of forebrain and the oRG progenitor cells. If achieved, this work therefore would represent a major insight into the molecular and cellular events that give rise to the disproportionately gyrated human brain. Narrative The project seeks to gain a quantitative understanding of the molecular networks within cells that control the generation of key progenitor cell types that arise during human brain development. To do so, it will develop modeling and computational tools as well as test these tools on human embryonic stem cell lines. In the longer term, a quantitative understanding of the circuits within cells that control development will allow us to uncover mechanisms underlying developmental disease.",Determining lineage decisions and gene regulatory networks governing the generation of key progenitor cell types during early human brain development,10140399,R01HD100036,"['Congenital Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Malformation ', ' Bar Codes ', ' barcode ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Joints ', ' Lentils -

"High-throughput computational modeling to assess the role of 3D genome folding in human congenital anomalies PROJECT SUMMARY Congenital heart defects (CHD) occur in nearly one percent of live births each year and are the leading cause of defect-associated infant mortality. The majority of genetic studies in CHD have focused on variation within the protein-coding exome; however, most disease-risk loci fall in noncoding regions, and it is presumed that some of these represent important regulators of gene expression such as cis-acting enhancers and insulators. In spite of these studies, less than half of the heritability of CHD has been explained via genome-wide associations or burden testing of protein-coding genes and putative regulatory elements. In this proposal, we hypothesize that genetic variants that alter 3D genome folding contribute to the etiology of CHD by disrupting the contacts of key cis-regulatory mechanisms in development. One type of chromatin structure that could be affected is the Topologically Associating Domain (TAD), which refers to a level of chromatin organization characterized by higher contact frequency within the domain relative to loci outside of that domain. It has been shown that while unaffected controls show a clear depletion of SVs at TAD boundary regions across the genome, individuals diagnosed with Developmental Delay (DD) and autism showed no bias in the genomic location of SVs. Based on these findings and the high rates of co-morbidity between DD and CHD, the first aim characterizes structural variation at TAD boundaries and other non-coding regulatory regions in CHD relative to controls, and will further determine whether TADs are enriched for SVs in a region-specific manner based on proximity to genes active in the developing heart. In the second aim, we use a complementary annotation- agnostic deep learning approach developed in our group to predict chromatin contact changes as a result of genetic variants in CHD patients. We will use Hi-C sequencing to confirm the model-predicted chromatin contact effects in iPSC-derived endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes, and additionally use RNA sequencing to determine whether the hypothesized transcriptional disruption occurred. Finally, in the third aim we will create a model that uses genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional features of genetic variants found in each individual to predict their phenotypic status. By analyzing the relative importance of features used to make predictions, we will be able to determine what types of biological mechanisms and pathways are most predictive for congenital heart anomalies. Collectively, these findings will elucidate a currently underappreciated source of regulatory disruption in human development, identify new disease-relevant genes and potential therapeutic targets, and will refine and validate a method for the high-throughput prediction of chromatin contact frequency to advance the field of 3D genomics. PROJECT NARRATIVE As the leading cause of defect-associated infant mortality, congenital heart defects have been studied extensively to better understand their underlying genetic mechanisms. However, previous approaches have focused on direct mutations to protein-coding elements and were not sufficient to explain the full heritability of this disease. Our proposal posits that an underappreciated disease mechanism is transcriptional misregulation during development caused by variants that disrupt 3D genome organization, and we therefore aim to characterize the extent to which this occurs in human heart defects and validate specific examples.",High-throughput computational modeling to assess the role of 3D genome folding in human congenital

"Genetic regulation of atrial gene expression in development and disease SUMMARY  Precise regulation of atrial gene expression is crucial to maintain atrial homeostasis, and disorders or gene mutations that impact atrial gene expression can cause atrial fibrillation (AF), a serious arrhythmia that affects an estimated 33 million people worldwide. However, there remain many gaps in our understanding of atrial gene regulation, including the mechanisms that underlie chamber-selective gene expression. Human genetic studies have shown that sequence variants near the cardiac transcription factor gene TBX5 are associated with greater AF risk, and mice with Tbx5 deficiency develop AF. Although recent work has identified some TBX5-regulated genes that contribute to AF susceptibility, the atrial TBX5-centered transcriptional network is incompletely explored. Elucidation of this network and its sensitivity to TBX5 dose would reveal nodal points in AF pathogenesis and may suggest new approaches to prevent or treat AF. The overarching goal of this re- search proposal is to elucidate the atrial gene regulatory network and how it is perturbed in AF. The proposal buillds on novel reagents and techniques developed in the Pu lab to interrogate transcriptional mechanisms in vivo, including highly sensitive and reproducible cardiac transcription factor ChIP-seq through in vivo biotinyla- tion (bioChIP-seq), massively parallel in vivo measurement of cis-regulatory element (CRE) activity (AAV- MPRA assay), and mosaic gene inactivation strategies to hone in direct, cell autonomous effects of gene inac- tivation. In Aim 1, we use bioChIP-seq and AAV-MPRA to define atrial CREs and to dissect the sequence fea- tures required for their chamber selective activity. In Aim 2, we determine the effect of TBX5 deficiency on the occupancy of other TFs and p300, the activity of CREs, and the expression of atrial genes. We use these data to define the TBX5-centered atrial gene regulatory network, and to determine how this network is perturbed by TBX5 haploinsufficiency or knockout. In Aim 3, we test the hypothesis, suggested by our preliminary data, that TBX5 regulates atrial genes through functional and physical interaction with TEAD1. Successful completion of this proposal will lead to new insights into atrial gene regulation and its perturbation in AF. NARRATIVE  The heart's upper chambers, the atria, and its lower chambers, the ventricles, contain fundamentally dis- tinct types of muscle cells, and are affected by different types of disease. One common and severe disease specific to the atria is atrial fibrillation, which occurs in over 9% of older individuals. This proposal will investi- gate the mechanisms that maintain atrial muscle cell gene expression, and perturbation of these mechanisms that cause atrial fibrillation, resulting in new insights into the causes of atrial diseases such as atrial fibrillation.",Genetic regulation of atrial gene expression in development and disease,10138240,R01HL156503,"['trans acting element ', ' Goals ', ' Heart

"Genome-wide structural organization of proteins within human gene regulatory complexes The DNA sequence of the human genome informs us as to the composition of proteins that make up healthy cells, but also altered compositions that create diseased cells. How protein production is controlled through the regulation of the genes that encode them is of critical importance for healthy and diseased cells. Knowing precisely where gene regulatory proteins bind, and are organized throughout the genome, including their interactions with each other, informs us as to how genes are regulated and mis-regulated. Since there are potentially thousands of different kinds of regulatory proteins and thousands of different kinds of human cell types and environmental responses that are a product of various subsets of regulatory proteins, the entire “universe” of gene regulatory events is quite substantial and consequently, quite costly to identify. A subset of these events will likely be informative or diagnostic of diseases states. Therefore, an important goal is to define informative interactions using cost-enabling, high accuracy, and robust genome-wide assays. To this end, ChIP-exo was developed to map the genomic binding locations of gene regulatory proteins at near-single base pair resolution. This assay will be applied, in high throughput, to determine the genome-wide positional organization of factors within protein-DNA complexes, like enhanceosomes. By broadly mapping the various classes of proteins that constitute much of the regulated epigenome, general rules about enhancer and repressor complex organization will be deduced. Aim 1 involves collecting genome-wide ChIP-exo data in human cell lines for a wide variety of protein-DNA complexes. Aim 2 will develop and implement computational approaches towards pattern recognition and data distillation in ChIP-exo datasets. The results are expected to provide structural insights into macromolecular protein complex assembly on a genomic scale, and in various cell types and conditions.

"Integrated multi-omics analyses of early mammalian craniofacial development Abstract Craniofacial abnormalities are some of the most commonly occurring human birth defects worldwide, with up to 200,000 children born every year with some type of craniofacial defect. These defects can occur as part of complex syndromes that involve multiple tissues and organs. The syndromic forms of these disorders have been successfully linked to nearly 500 genes including TWIST1 for craniosynostosis and IRF6 for orofacial clefting. However more frequently no other part of the body is directly involved (50% of craniosynostoses, 70% of orofacial clefts). Genome wide association studies indicate heritability for such defects, however the vast majority of associations fall outside of genes suggesting defective gene regulation is a major contributor to incidence of such defects. Gene regulatory elements can be located throughout the genome and typically have tissue-specific activity, making them difficult to identify and predict what gene they control. The overall objective of this application is to integrate epigenomic and transcriptomic data sets from early human and mouse craniofacial development from our lab as well as FaceBase to comprehensively predict regulatory element-gene interactions. Our hypothesis posits that conserved regulatory networks between human and mouse are enriched for disease relevant biology. In Aim 1 we propose to systematically identify chromatin states in human from 4.5 to 8 weeks of gestation and in mouse from embryonic days 9.5 to 15.5. In Aim 2 we propose to identify genes that are coordinately regulated in both species across these developmental windows. Finally, in Aim 3 we propose to integrate these two disparate network types to identify regulatory element-gene pairings. We will experimentally validate predicted interactions in a culture model of cranial neural crest cells using proximity-ligation coupled with immunoprecipitation. Our proposed studies will generate the most comprehensive epigenomic and transcriptomic networks in a developing human tissue and for the first time identify the conserved regulatory architecture for building the mammalian orofacial complex. Defects in embryonic patterning resulting in clefts of orofacial tissue are common birth defects affecting more than 1 in 1000 live births. The genetic causes of these defects have been difficult to determine, but all current evidence suggests defective gene regulation during embryonic development underlies these birth defects. This project seeks to identify regulatory networks that control gene expression during craniofacial development and are conserved between human and mouse.",Integrated multi-omics analyses of early mammalian craniofacial development,10083207,R03DE028588,"['differentially expressed ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing ', ' ChIA-PET ', ' Chromosome Interaction Analysis with Paired-End Tags ', ' computational pipelines ', ' Congenital Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Malformation ', ' Affect ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Biology ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Chromatin ', ' Craniosynostosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Exons ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Genome ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunoprecipitation ', ' Immune Precipitation ', ' Incidence ', ' Laboratories ', ' Ligation ', ' Closure by Ligation ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Play ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Proteins ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' Enhancers ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Cephalic ', ' Cranial ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Body part ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' craniofacial anomalies ', ' craniofacial defects ', ' craniofacial malformation ', ' Craniofacial Abnormalities ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' human tissue ', ' Pattern ', ' Live Birth ', ' craniofacies ', ' craniofacial ', ' gene interaction ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Neural Crest Cell ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Embryonic Tissue ', ' embryo tissue ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Homolog of Drosophila TWIST 1 ', ' Homolog of Drosophila TWIST1 ', ' TWIST gene ', ' TWIST1 ', ' Transcription Factor TWIST ', ' twist protein ', ' TWIST1 gene ', ' Address ', ' Defect ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' genome wide association study ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' epigenomics ', ' orofacial ', ' virtual ', ' Coupled ', ' Heritability ', ' transcriptomics ', ' Network-based ', ' comparative ', ' exome sequencing ', ' exome-seq ', ' epigenome ', ' FaceBase ', ' genetic information ', ' craniofacial development ', ' orofacial cleft ', ' orofacial clefting ', ' differential expression ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT SCH OF MED/DNT,R03,2021,164000,CT-05
"Systematic Identification of Core Regulatory Circuitry from ENCODE Data While much progress has been made generating high quality chromatin state and accessibility data from the ENCODE and Roadmap consortia, accurately identifying cell-type specific enhancers from these data remains a significant challenge. We have recently developed a computational approach (gkmSVM) to predict regulatory elements from DNA sequence, and we have shown that when gkmSVM is trained on DHS data from each of the human and mouse ENCODE and Roadmap cells and tissues, it can predict both cell specific enhancer activity and the impact of regulatory variants (deltaSVM) with greater precision than alternative approaches. The gkmSVM model encapsulates a set of cell-type specific weights describing the regulatory binding site vocabulary controlling chromatin accessibility in each cell type. A striking observation is that the significant gkmSVM weights are generally identifiable with a small (~20) set of TF binding sites which vary by cell-type, consistent with the hypothesis that cell-type specific expression programs are controlled by a small set of core factors tightly coupled in mutually interacting regulatory circuits. Perturbations of these core regulators enable transitions between stable differentiated cell-type states of this genetic circuit. Here, we will use gkmSVM to systematically identify the core regulatory circuitry in all existing ENCODE and Roadmap human and mouse cell lines and tissues, and produce DNA sequence based genomic regulatory maps and fine-scale predictions of core regulator binding sites within predicted regulatory regions. We will generate binding site models for core regulators in each cell type, assess the accuracy of our predictions through direct experimental validation. The value of this map critically depends on its accuracy, so we demonstrate that gkmSVM predictions consistently outperform alternative methods in massively parallel enhancer reporter and luciferase validation assays, in blind community assessments of regulatory element predictions (CAGI), and in predicting validated causal disease associated variants. In contrast, we show that methods using PWM descriptions of TF binding sites are significantly less accurate. We will produce base-pair resolution predictions of the cell specific TF binding sites (TFBS) within broader regulatory regions detected by multiple ENCODE epigenomic Mapping datasets, and to test these TFBS predictions in collaboration with Functional Characterization Centers (FCC). Our regulatory maps will help design and inform focused experiments probing regulatory mechanisms, and aid in the interpretation of disease associated non-coding variants. We propose to develop computational tools to systematically identify the core TF regulators using DNA sequence based machine learning (ML) in all existing ENCODE and Roadmap human and mouse cell lines and tissues, and to produce base-pair resolution predictions of the cell specific TF binding sites (TFBS) within broader regulatory regions detected by multiple ENCODE epigenomic Mapping datasets, and to test these TFBS predictions in collaboration with Functional Characterization Centers (FCC).",Systematic Identification of Core Regulatory Circuitry from ENCODE Data,10238262,U01HG009380,"['Base Sequence ', ' Nucleotide Sequence ', ' nucleic acid sequence ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Luciferases ', ' Luciferase Immunologic ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Weight ', ' Enhancers ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Encapsulated ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Training ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Reporter ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' cell type ', ' Base Pairing ', ' Modeling ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Data ', ' Mouse Cell Line ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Resolution ', ' Validation ', ' epigenomics ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' blind ', ' Coupled ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' ']",NHGRI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,572256,MD-07
"A big data approach to explore epigenetic heterogeneity and interpret noncoding variants for psychiatric disorders PROJECT ABSTRACT  The incidence of diagnosed psychiatric disorders has been increasing for decades, leaving millions of afflicted individuals. Despite the high heritability, their underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Most risk loci are located in noncoding genomic elements without direct effects on protein products. Comprehensive functional annotation and variant impact quantification are essential to provide new molecular insights and discover therapeutic targets.  Recent advances in novel sequencing technologies and community efforts to share genomic data provide unprecedented opportunities to understand how genetic variants contribute to psychiatric diseases. This application describes the development of integrative strategies and machine learning methods to combine novel assays (such as STARR-seq) with population-scale genomic profiles to elucidate the genetic regulatory grammar in the human prefrontal cortex (PFC) and to prioritize genetic variants in psychiatric disorders. Specifically, we will (1) dissect the cis- regulatory landscape of the PFC using population-scale epigenetics data, (2) construct multi- model gene regulatory networks by linking distal cis-regulatory elements to genes using chromatin co-variability analyses, (3) integrate genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional data to identify key transcription factors and variants that contribute to psychiatric disorders. Distinct from existing efforts focusing on one genome, this proposed work presents a truly novel big-data approach for both modeling gene regulation and investigating disease-risk factors by incorporating heterogeneous multi-omics profiles from hundreds of individuals. The resultant comprehensive list of cis-regulatory elements will expand the number of known functional regions in the human brain by at least an order. We will release our methods and resources in the form of web services, distributed open-source software, and annotation databases, which will also benefit other investigators exploring the genetic underpinnings of neuropsychiatric disorders.  In addition to its scientific content, this application proposes a comprehensive training program for preparing an independent investigator in computational genomics and neurogenetics. This training will take place at Yale University (in the Dept. of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry) under the mentorship of Prof. Mark Gerstein (functional genomics), Prof. Nenad Sestan (neurogenetics), and Prof. Hongyu Zhao (statistical genetics and machine learning). A committee of experienced psychiatric disease experts and data scientists will also provide advice on both scientific research and career development. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed study is to leverage advanced machine learning methods to discover cis- regulatory elements in the noncoding genome by incorporating novel functional characterization technologies (such as STARR-seq) with genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic data from psychiatric patients. In contrast to existing methods that rely on a single genome, this work assumes a dynamic regulatory program in each individual and explores the regulatory heterogeneity across hundreds of epigenomes, thereby significantly expanding our current knowledge of the noncoding genome and facilitating functional interpretation of genetic variants. Furthermore, it will also generate publicly available annotation resources and software packages for the scientific community, thereby significantly accelerating the pace of novel therapeutic target discovery for treating psychiatric disorders.",A big data approach to explore epigenetic heterogeneity and interpret noncoding variants for psychiatric disorders,10219797,K01MH123896,"['Affect ', '

"Quantitative regulatory genomics: networks, cis-regulatory codes, and phenotypic variation How do changes in DNA sequence impact organismal properties? This is a central question of modern  biology, and insights into it can help us understand, among other things, why patients respond  differently to the same treatment, or why some species exhibit behavioral properties not seen in  other species. A major hurdle in solving this ‘genotype-to-phenotype’ problem is our poor knowledge  of gene regulatory mechanisms underlying phenotypes and cellular processes, and how those  mechanisms are encoded in DNA. It also leads to severe difficulties in prioritizing  phenotype-linked non-coding variants (polymorphisms) for further investigation. Driven by these  challenges, my lab seeks to develop quantitative frameworks for describing and  discovering transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. We have made significant progress towards this  goal in two main directions: (1) We have developed detailed biophysical models of the  cis-regulatory encoding of gene expression. Using these models we have shown how the regulatory  function of transcription factor (TF) binding sites depends on their sequence and DNA shape, as  well as their ‘trans-context’, e.g., cellular concentrations of regulators, and  ‘cis-context’, e.g., proximity to other TF binding sites and chromatin states. (2) We have  devised statistical models to discover TF-gene interactions from transcriptomic data, as well as  other types of ‘omics’ data if available. Working closely with biologists, we have applied these  models to understand phenotypes such as cytotoxic drug response in cell lines, behavioral response  to social encounters, and embryonic development. Building on the strong foundations of our  past work, I propose to establish a research program that studies transcriptional regulation  holistically at the cis- and trans- levels. Our new pursuits will include: (1) use of our  computational, sequence-level models to describe two data-rich mammalian regulatory programs, an  experimental collaboration to dissect the cis-regulatory logic of a key inflammation gene using  massively parallel reporter assays, and major advances in our modeling techniques; (2) new  machine learning methods for reconstructing networks of TF-gene interactions that explain  phenotypic differences, integration of cis- and trans-regulatory evidence from multi-omics  data, and collaborations to apply these methods in cancer pharmacogenomics and behavioral  neurogenomics; (3) a new probabilistic framework to combine traditional statistical scores of a  non-coding variant with quantitative predictions of its regulatory impact based on the  above-mentioned techniques. Explorations of new forms of synergy among these related goals of  network reconstruction, cis-regulatory sequence modeling and variant interpretation will be woven  throughout our research program. The proposed work will answer fundamental questions about molecular mechanisms underlying  phenotypic differences between individuals, such as why different patients respond differently to  the same drug. We will develop new computational methods for discovery of such mechanisms from a  variety of genomics data sets. We will work closely with experimental biologists and use our tools  to study important biological topics including cancer drug response, inflammation, and effect of  estrogen on breast cancer.","Quantitative regulatory genomics: networks, cis-regulatory codes, and phenotypic variation",10267176,R35GM131819,"['Antineoplastic Agents ', ' Anti-Cancer Agents ', ' Antineoplastic Drugs ', ' Antineoplastics ', ' Cancer Drug ', ' Neoplastic Disease Chemotherapeutic Agents ', ' Tumor-Specific Treatment Agents ', ' anti-cancer drug ', ' anticancer agent ', ' anticancer drug ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biology ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Chromatin ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Estrogens ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Exhibits ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Inflammation ', ' Logic ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Modernization ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Research ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Work ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Collaborations ', ' Cytotoxic drug ', ' Cytotoxic agent ', ' Shapes ', ' Reporter ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Techniques ', ' gene interaction ', ' synergism ', ' social ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Pharmacogenomics ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' Data ', ' Molecular ', ' Behavioral ', ' reconstruction ', ' transcriptomics ', ' biophysical model ', ' behavioral response ', ' behavior response ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' neurogenomics ', ' neuro-genomics ', ' Multiomic Data ', ' multiple omic data ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R35,2021,356979,IL-13

"Defining causal roles of genomic variants on gene regulatory networks with spatiotemporally-resolved single-cell multiomics PROJECT SUMMARY A fundamental question in biology is to understand how genetic variation affects genome function to influence phenotypes. The majority of genetic variants associated with human diseases are located within non-coding genomic regions and may affect genome functions and phenotypes through modulating the activity of cis- regulatory elements and cell-type specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs). However, our knowledge about the impact of genomic variants (alone or as combinations) on gene expression, GRN activity and ultimately cellular phenotypes are rather limited. Further, because transcription factors (TFs) and related cis-regulatory elements are known to have distinct functions based on cell-type and state, how genomic variants influence cell-type/state-specific activity of functional elements and phenotypes remains to be characterized in much greater details. This proposal aims to leverage a panel of multi-ethnic, gender-balanced human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines (European, African American and African hunter gatherers) as well as recent advances in single- cell time-resolved or multi-omics technologies, predictive modeling of regulatory networks by machine learning and high throughput single-cell perturbation methods to study the functional impact of genomic variations on regulatory network, cellular phenotypes. First, we will establish a robust experimental framework of deploying advanced time-resolved and multi-omic single-cell technologies for detecting functional genetic variants at single-cell level. Next, we will develop novel computational methods for integration of single-cell data across different modalities and for accurate reconstruction and predictive modeling of GRNs driving cellular identify, developmental dynamics (cardiac and neural lineage cell fate transition). Finally, we will apply high-throughput combinatorial genetic or epigenetic perturbation approaches to modulate activity of key genes or putative cis- regulatory elements at single-cell levels to improve our understanding of network level relationships among genomic variants and phenotypes. PROJECT NARRATIVE A fundamental question in biology is to understand how genetic variation affects genome function to influence phenotypes. Our in-depth characterization of functional impact of genomic variation on human developmental gene regulatory networks in ancestrally diverse populations will provide critical insights into human development and diseases and have the potential to greatly help translating disease risk alleles to therapeutic targets.",Defining causal roles of genomic variants on gene regulatory networks with

"Design, prediction, and prioritization of systematic perturbations of the human genome ABSTRACT Noncoding genetic variation that alters gene regulation is of paramount importance for health, disease, and evolution. Diseases ranging in incidence from the most common to the most rare all have substantial risk associated with regulatory variation; and most of the genetic differences between closely related species are noncoding. Whole genome sequencing can directly identify that variation but to realize its potential to elucidate the genetic determinants of health and disease, will require accurate annotation of this noncoding variation for functionality. In coding sequence, the genetic code allows variants to be annotated to a rough hierarchy of likely functional effects and pathogenicity. In noncoding sequence such annotation is less clear. Perturbation assays, i.e., assays that modify genetic or epigenetic states and measure the effect of those perturbations on regulatory endpoints, offer a possible path to annotating noncoding variation. However, to fully leverage this data, novel and sophisticated statistical and machine learning approaches are required to extract useful information from those assays, to integrate that information across regulatory endpoints, and to extrapolate findings so that annotation of previously unobserved (unperturbed) variation in diverse cell types is possible. The goal of the Duke Prediction Center is to develop the analytic approaches and tools that will allow for the routine annotation of noncoding variation for functionality and ultimately pathogenicity. Aim 1 is to establish best practices in perturbation assay design and analysis. This will allow IGVF characterization centers design their experiments so that, when coupled with optimized analyses, the data produced will be maximally informative for subsequent predictive modeling. Aim 2 is to develop novel mechanistic machine learning approaches for predicting the functional effect of noncoding variation on function in diverse cell-types. Aim 3 is to identify noncoding genomic regions that are subject to functional constraint which will be leveraged in prioritizing variants for pathogenicity. The expected outcomes of this project will be (i) robust estimates of optimal experimental design parameters and recommendations for analysis tools and best practices for the various assays used within the IGVF consortium, (ii) predicted functional effects of observed variation to be shared through the IGVF variant/phenotype catalog as well as a state-of-the-art machine learning method (and associated tools) that can identify previously-unknown interactions among genomic variants, both observed and novel, and predict their functional impact in diverse cell types, and (iii) a list of regulatory elements subject to functional constraint shared through the IGVF variant/phenotype catalog and a principled prioritization framework (and associated tools) for interpreting variation within patient genomes for pathogenicity. Due to the considerable success of genetics, there are thousands of unknown regulatory causes of disease. Each of those causes is an opportunity to improve treatment, diagnostics, or prevention. This project will be a major advance towards unlocking that potential. PROJECT NARRATIVE The culmination of the proposal will be a systematic and comprehensive approach for interpreting noncoding variants to understand the underlying mechanisms that link genetics to gene expression and causes of human disease. That outcome will transform human disease studies by allowing noncoding sequence variation to inform genetic causes of disease, both in novel disease gene discovery studies and in the diagnostic interpretation of individual patient genomes.","Design, prediction, and prioritization of systematic perturbations of the human genome",10295506,U01HG011967,"['machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' computer biology ', ' Computational Biology ', ' catalog ', ' Catalogs ', ' exhaustion ', ' cell type ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' Prevention ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Endpoint Assays ', ' End Point Assay ', ' genetic determinant ', ' Genetic Determinism ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' genomic region ', ' Update ', ' Output ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' Coupling ', ' combinatorial ', ' human disease ', ' gene discovery ', ' discover genes ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' CRISPR ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' individual patient ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Evolution ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Explosion ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genetic Code ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Recommendation ', ' Risk ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Measures ', ' Mutagenesis ', ' Genetics-Mutagenesis ', ' Mutagenesis Molecular Biology ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Sample Size ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' ']",NHGRI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,353667,NC-04
"Causal Effect Estimation of Regulatory Molecules Project Summary/Abstract Transcription factors and microRNAs are essential regulatory molecules (RM) that control messenger RNAs (mRNA) and are known to be dysregulated in human diseases. Each RM may affect multiple pathways of the cell which is both a blessing and a curse. If a therapy targets the proper RM, it can attack the disease from multiple fronts and increase efficacy. On the other hand, targeted therapy may result in serious adverse effects due to our limited knowledge of the downstream causal effect of RM manipulation. Although the local bindings between single RMs and their targets have been studied computationally and experimentally, the intensity of functional consequences of such bindings on the transcriptome is unclear. Here, I propose statistical machine learning techniques and causal inference methods to predict the observed variability of gene expression using only regulatory molecules and estimate their downstream causal effect on the entire transcriptome. To achieve this goal, I start in Aim 1 by building a multi-response predictive model to predict the whole transcriptome using only RMs. This goal is challenging because the dimension of the response vector is more than the number of samples and I will use techniques from high-dimensional statistics to address this issue. In Aim 2, I will go beyond predictive modeling by estimating the causal effect of RMs on the transcriptome using invariant causal prediction. I will leverage the rapidly growing literature which connects causal inference to invariant prediction accuracy across heterogeneous data sources to infer the causal effect of RMs on mRNA. Having developed both predictive and causal models of RMs contribution to gene regulation, in Aim 3 during the R00 phase, I will focus on the most recent advances in double/debiased machine learning which allows the use of scalable machine learning methods for reliable estimation of causal effect of RMs on transcription. My proposed research will bring the most advanced statistical machine learning and causal inference techniques to genomics research and help design more effective targeted therapies by providing insights into the global role of RMs in gene expression regulation. During the training phase of the award, with the support of my outstanding mentoring team and scientific advisory committee, I will gain expertise in molecular biology and genomics while perfecting my knowledge of causal inference and machine learning. The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center – James Hospital and the Mathematical Biosciences Institute will provide me with the ideal interdisciplinary environment to bridge data science and genomics and will help me achieve my career development goals and transition to a tenure-track faculty position. Project Narrative Targeting regulatory elements has the advantage of concurrently attacking multiple damaged pathways, with the possible pitfall of toxicity due to adverse unintended effects. Understanding the functional global impact of therapy on the entire transcriptome will guide us in designing drugs with higher efficacy and lower toxicity.

"Identification and characterization of chromatin regulators of coordinated synaptic gene expression Project Summary/Abstract Nervous system function requires the integration of diverse neuronal subtypes into neural circuits that elicit thought and behavior. Despite the extensive diversity of neuronal subtypes, all neurons share key features, including chemical synapses. Current models indicate that shared neuronal genes, including pan-synaptic genes, are independently regulated by different combinations of transcription factors in distinct neuronal subtypes, whereas subtype-specific synaptic genes are regulated by specific transcription factors called terminal selectors. Our data demonstrate that pan-neuronal and subtype-specific synaptic genes are temporally coordinated during synaptogenesis. We have identified a candidate gene regulatory network (GRN) that includes two known pioneer factors, and propose a model in which positive and negative regulation of chromatin accessibility underlie the coordinated regulation of synaptic gene expression to promote synapse formation. In Aim 1, we propose genomic and in vivo functional validation to test the model that two of our candidate transcription factors, GA-rich motif binding factors CLAMP and GAGA factor, bind to the same promoters of synaptic genes to exert opposite effects on chromatin accessibility and transcription. In Aim 2, we propose a comprehensive and unbiased approach to identifying the GRNs underlying coordinated synaptic gene expression through single-nucleus RNA- and ATAC-Seq. Successful completion of these studies will advance our understanding of how the development of shared neuronal traits is coordinated with cell fate acquisition, and may inform neuronal reprogramming of stem cells. Project Narrative The nervous system is remarkable for its cellular diversity and functional complexity, yet despite extensive diversity, all neurons share key features such as chemical synapses. While pan- neuronal and sub-type specific genes are thought to be regulated through distinct mechanisms, our data demonstrate that these classes of synaptic genes are temporally coordinated during synaptogenesis.

"Computational methods to predict gene regulatory network dynamics and cell state transitions Project Summary The goal of this research program is to provide tools for the discovery of transcriptional networks that control cell fate decisions. Cell fate decisions driven by cell state transitions underlie essential cell processes from development to cellular reprogramming. There is an opportunity to make use of publicly available genomic data to develop predictive computational models of cell state transition dynamics. The methods proposed will offer means to gain insight into cell fate decision-making and how it is transcriptionally regulated, given specific cell fate decision points and suitable data. Examples of such decision points include control of epidermal regeneration, or the maintenance of balance among myeloid cell fates during hematopoiesis. In order to bridge the gap between genomics and cell dynamics, statistical and computational modeling challenges must be overcome. Two key challenges form the basis of this research program: 1) developing statistical methods to infer regulatory networks while accounting for the levels of variability between single cells, and 2) developing computational models to couple gene regulatory dynamics within cells and cell-cell communication between cells. To address the first challenge, we will develop machine learning models to predict gene expression dynamics from time-series data. These models will be able to classify genes by their temporal patterns, and the results will inform gene network inference. We will then develop methods for network inference that integrate muti-modal data (single-cell RNA and ATAC sequencing) as well as cell-cell signaling information to learn networks that control specific cell state transitions. To address the second challenge, we will develop differential equation-based multiscale models of the gene regulatory network dynamics coupled with the cell- external signaling dynamics. This will allow us to capture both molecular and cellular dynamics in high resolution, and thus identify which parameters exert key control over the system. We will use Bayesian methods for parameter inference to fit models to data and perform model selection, adapting methods where needed for multiscale model inference. Models will be rigorously evaluated through their application to specific systems, including cell differentiation (e.g. myeloid fate decisions during hematopoiesis) and development (e.g. nephron progenitor cell fate decisions). In each of these organ systems, models predictions will be tested experimentally via collaborations. Following iterative testing, open-source, validated methods will be made widely available for the study of the dynamic processes of cell fate decision-making. Project Narrative Cell fate decisions are essential for development and the maintenance of organs throughout life, thus understanding them underlies health challenges ranging from developmental disorders to cancer. This project will develop computational methods using genomic data to study the dynamic gene expression programs that control cell fate decisions.

"Encoding genomic architecture in the encyclopedia: linking DNA elements, chromatin state, and gene expression in 3D This section has not changed since the submission of the parent U01 grant. Project Summary Most of the 1000s of sequencing experiments generated by ENCODE provide 1D readouts of the epigenetic landscape or transcriptional output of a 3D genome. New chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies – in particular Hi-C and ChIA-PET – have begun to provide insight into the hierarchical 3D organization of the genome: the partition of chromosomes into open and closed compartments; the existence of structural subunits defined as topologically associated domains (TADs); and the presence of regulatory and structural DNA loops within TADs. New experimental evidence using CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing suggests that disruption of local 3D structure can alter regulation of neighboring genes, and there have been early efforts to use data on 3D DNA looping to predict the impact of non-coding SNPs from GWAS studies. The goal of this proposal is to develop new integrative computational methods to interpret large-scale ENCODE 1D epigenomic and transcriptomic resources in light of the underlying 3D architecture of the genome. Members of our team have pioneered powerful methods to infer local chromatin states from a 1D viewpoint through the Segway suite. We have also analyzed the 1D organization of chromatin accessible elements and their lineage dynamics to define the concept of regulatory complexity, and we presented a gene regulation model to predict gene expression changes in differentiation from the DNA content of active enhancers. Here we will build on these efforts to learn chromatin state and gene regulation models that incorporate information on hierarchical 3D genomic architecture, enabling us to predict how individual structural/regulatory elements contribute to 3D DNA looping and to gene expression. Mechanistic predictions will be experimentally validated in their native cell-type specific chromatin context using state-of-the-art genome editing, exploiting computational and experimental CRISPR/Cas tools developed by our team. This section has not changed since the submission of the parent U01 grant. Project Narrative This project develops advanced computational methods for integrating information on the 3D structure of the human genome with large-scale genomics data sets generated by the ENCODE project to gain insight into cell-type specific chromatin state and gene regulation.

"Comprehensive functional characterization and dissection of noncoding regulatory elements and human genetic variation Summary The ENCODE project has generated comprehensive maps of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) controlling the transcription of genes within the human genome. These maps have been crucial in our efforts to understand sequence variants linked to human traits and disease, as the majority of these variants are non-coding regulatory changes rather than amino acid substitutions. However, even though we know the locations of thousands of CREs, our understanding of how they operate is derived from a relatively small set of well-described examples. Therefore, we plan to directly characterize the function of ENCODE CREs at a genome-wide scale in multiple cell-types. This will transition the field of functional genomics from a simple map of regulatory elements towards a deep understanding of the fundamental rules governing regulatory logic down to the basepair resolution. Achieving this will dramatically expand ENCODE’s utility by strengthening our ability to interpret the effects of natural human variation on gene regulation. We propose to directly measure regulatory activity of over 3% of the genome, pursuing loci highlighted as important by ENCODE and other functional data. We will first apply computational methods to identify the most biologically informative CREs, representing a diversity of regulatory logic and architecture, and will use machine learning techniques to prioritize functional variants for characterization relevant to common and rare human diseases, traits, and adaptation. Of these we will select 100,000 CREs and 375,000 variants, representing ~100 Mb of genomic sequence, and characterize them using the massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to understand each element’s regulatory activity. Then, to complement data from the MPRA, we will characterize additional 1 Mb regions across 20 loci using CRISPR-based non-coding screens to build a comprehensive picture of these loci. This strategy leverages the throughput and flexibility of MPRA while maintaining the connectivity of regulatory logic in the CRISPR-based screens, which perturb elements within their endogenous genomic context. This will help us judge the accuracy and completeness of ENCODE, while also providing data from both approaches to address a wide-variety of research questions. These methods are difficult to apply to disease relevant primary cells at full scale, but we will use the results of our MPRA and CRISPR screens to inform our models and better predict the fundamental rules of regulatory logic. We will then construct smaller, targeted libraries to test disease-specific variants in primary cells and use assays specific for each of three autoimmune diseases: type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and lupus. This approach will inform the research community on the rules governing the activity of the CREs mapped by the ENCODE project, and will simultaneously provide concrete information about the function of hundreds of thousands of sequence variants relevant for human traits, health, and disease. Project Narrative In our proposal we seek to extend the efforts by the ENCODE consortium and others who have made significant strides towards mapping the regulatory landscape of the human genome. We will apply large-scale functional characterization methods to directly test over 3% of the human genome for cis-regulatory activity. In doing so, we will create a resource that will improve our ability to pinpoint regulatory elements in our genome, increase our understanding of how they function, and aid in our ability to link genetic variation to human health and disease.",Comprehensive functional characterization and dissection of noncoding regulatory elements and human genetic variation,10241056,UM1HG009435,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune condition ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Brittle Diabetes Mellitus ', ' IDDM ', ' Juvenile-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Sudden-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T1 DM ', ' T1 diabetes ', ' T1D ', ' T1DM ', ' Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 1 diabetes ', ' Type I Diabetes Mellitus ', ' insulin dependent diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes mellitus ', ' ketosis prone diabetes ', ' type I diabetes ', ' type one diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dissection ', ' Elements ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Disorder ', ' Libraries ', ' Logic ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Reporter ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Amino Acid Substitution ', ' trait ', ' Modeling ', ' functional genomics ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Resolution ', ' Lupus ', ' human disease ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' CRISPR ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' CRISPR screen ', ' CRISPR editing screen ', ' CRISPR-based screen ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 screen ', ' clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats screen ', ' ']",NHGRI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",UM1,2021,1496338,MA-07
"Deciphering the Genomics of Gene Network Regulation of T Cell and Fibroblast States in Autoimmune Inflammation Abstract Natural genetic variation impacts most human diseases, yet predicting how regulatory variants control gene expression and ultimately disease phenotypes poses considerable challenges. First, the polygenic inheritance influencing most conditions requires consideration of a vast number of genes and regulatory elements. This task is challenged by the complexity of gene regulation, where 3D regulatory interactions can link enhancers and genes over large genomic distances. Second, multiple interacting cell types are often dysregulated in disease pathology. This necessitates an understanding of how the collective variants associating with a disease affect each cell type involved in the disease process and subsequently how these dysregulated cellular phenotypes crossregulate and drive subsequent cellular states. In this IGVF project, we will use rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a human autoimmune inflammatory disease, as a case study to develop robust machine learning models of gene regulation to decipher the impact of genomic variation on multiple cellular drivers of pathology—namely, inflammatory T cell and fibroblast subsets found in affected joint tissue. The choice of RA is motivated by its public health importance, specified target tissue, access to clinical samples, considerable knowledge of disease-associated gene loci, and our team’s complementary expertise in machine learning, RA pathophysiology, immunology and inflammation, and single-cell functional genomics. We will develop an advanced machine learning framework to model the effects of allelic variation on gene regulatory networks based on the analysis of epigenomes, transcriptomes, and connectomes of mouse activated T cells and synovial fibroblasts and extend these models to RA patient joint tissue and primary cells. We will train allele-specific gene regulatory models (GRMs) that account for long-range regulatory interactions by integrating single-cell transcriptome and epigenome (sc-multiome) data with bulk 3D interactome analyses. A notable feature of our approach is that we leverage the genetic diversity of evolutionarily distant F1 hybrid mice to provide robust training data for these models, and then apply these advances to the human context through transfer learning. Highly parallelized Perturb-seq experiments in primary synovial fibroblasts from RA patients with single-cell multiomic readouts will then be used to evaluate and refine regulatory models and to train network models that connect gene expression programs to phenotype. Finally, we will combine spatial and single-cell transcriptomics conducted on samples from RA inflamed joints to model the organization and interactions between T cells and sedentary tissue-organizing fibroblasts within local cellular communities. The predictive GRMs that will be generated from our study along with the experimental systems for human disease will be readily transferrable to other polygenic disorders which must consider complex regulatory genomic networks for various interacting cell types in affected tissues. Narrative We will develop advanced machine learning approaches to combine single-cell multiomic and bulk 3D interactome data to model the impact of genetic variation on gene regulation, using rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as a disease model. Our gene regulatory models and experimental analyses will focus on two cell types that drive RA tissue pathology—T cells and synovial fibroblasts—and will serve as a case study for examining the genetics of polygenic human diseases that dysregulate multiple interacting cell types within affected tissues.",Deciphering the Genomics of Gene Network Regulation of T Cell and Fibroblast States in Autoimmune Inflammation,10305241,U01HG012103,"['Affect ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Antigen-Presenting Cells ', ' accessory cell ', ' Rheumatoid Arthritis ', ' Atrophic Arthritis ', ' rheumatic arthritis ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cultured Cells ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Fibroblasts ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' Inborn Genetic Diseases ', ' Inherited disorder ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' heritable disorder ', ' inborn error ', ' inherited diseases ', ' inherited genetic disease ', ' inherited genetic disorder ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybrids ', ' Inflammation ', ' arthropathies ', ' Joint Diseases ', ' arthropathic ', ' arthropathy ', ' joint disorder ', ' Joints ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Public Health ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' T-Cells ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Enhancers ', ' Immunology ', ' Organizational Models ', ' Clinical ', ' sedentary ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Genetic ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' Distant ', ' In Situ ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' empowered ', ' human data ', ' novel ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' functional genomics ', ' Genomics ', ' Polygenic Characters ', ' Polygenic Inheritances ', ' Polygenic Traits ', ' Cell to Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell-Cell Signaling ', ' intercellular communication ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' degenerative condition ', ' degenerative disease ', ' Degenerative Disorder ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' CAST/EiJ Mouse ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' disease phenotype ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' T cell regulation ', ' transcriptomics ', ' Cell model ', ' Cellular model ', ' experimental analysis ', ' Network-based ', ' human disease ', ' network models ', ' epigenome ', ' genomic variation ', ' epigenetic regulation ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' connectome ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' joint inflammation ', ' inflamed joint ', ' joint swelling ', ' cell community ', ' cellular community ', ' mouse genetics ', ' genomic locus ', ' gene locus ', ' genetic locus ', ' Autoimmune ', ' autoimmune inflammation ', ' ']",NHGRI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,U01,2021,1280000,NY-12

"Computational approaches for comparative regulatory genomics to decipher long-range gene regulation Project Abstract/Summary The three-dimensional organization of the genome is a major player in long-range gene regulation, where regulatory elements such as enhancers affect the expression of a gene hundreds of kilobases away. Changes in three-dimensional organization are associated with tissue-specific gene expression and have been implicated in several human diseases including cancer, diabetes and obesity. Advances in chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies have expanded our repertoire of long-range interactions between enhancers and promoters in model cell lines and have shown that such interactions are established through a complex interplay of chromatin state, transcription factor binding and three-dimensional proximity of genomic regions. However, our current understanding of the dynamics of long-range gene regulation is limited, both across different cell types as well as across different species. This is because of the absence of such datasets in most species and cell types, lack of systematic methods to predict and interpret these interactions, and due to limited approaches to compare both the regions and their interactions across different cell types and especially across species. The overarching goals of this proposal are to develop novel computational methods to jointly identify candidate regulatory elements in multiple species and predict their long- range interactions in new cell types and species where high-throughput 3C datasets are not available or difficult to obtain. In Aim 1, we will develop a phylogenetically aware method of jointly identifying regulatory elements such as enhancers in multiple species. Aim 2 will develop multi-task and transfer learning approaches to predict interactions in new species and cell types by integrating available high-throughput 3C datasets from multiple cell types and 3C platforms. In Aim 3, we will collect a novel multi-species chromatin mark dataset in species-specific endothelial cells to enable a systematic study of long-range gene regulation dynamics. We will apply our computational approaches developed in Aims 1 and 2 on this multi-species epigenomic dataset to identify different regulatory elements and predict long-range interactions in multiple species. We will develop rigorous computational measures to evaluate the quality of predictions from our novel methods and the improvements compared to existing methods based on published 3C datasets. We will further experimentally validate predicted interactions using Capture-HiC in multiple species and using CRISPR/Cas9 experiments. We will examine individual and groups of interactions to identify species-specific, and clade- specific interactions and interpret the corresponding genes in the context of known pathways and curated gene sets associated with cardiovascular diseases. Our methods will be widely applicable to dissect long-range gene regulation in complex phenotypes including diseases. Software tools, resources, original data and experimental protocols developed by this project will be made publicly available. Project Narrative Long-range gene regulatory interactions are emerging as important determinants of tissue-specific gene expression and are often disrupted in different diseases including cancer. Such interactions occur between distally located regulatory sequence elements and genes hundreds of kilobases away. Currently our understanding of long-range gene regulation is limited to a few cell types and model organisms. Computational methods to identify regulatory elements and systematically link them to target genes in diverse cell types and mammalian species can significantly improve our understanding of the impact of long-range gene regulation in human diseases, help interpret regulatory variation in non-coding parts of the genome and assist in the development of better biomarkers.",Computational approaches for

We have made important contributions describing the unique modes of allosteric regulation in various protein kinases, deciphering the structural basis of oncogenic activation in a subset of receptor tyrosine kinases, uncovering the regulation of pseudokinases, and developing new tools and resources for addressing data integration challenges in the signaling field. We propose to build on these impactful studies to answer key questions emanating from our ongoing studies such as: What are the functions of pseudokinases, the catalytically-inert members of the kinome, and how can we use pseudokinases to better predict and characterize non-catalytic functions of kinases? What are the functions of conserved cysteine residues in regulatory sites of protein and small molecule kinases and are they post-translationally modified in redox signaling and oxidative stress response that are causally associated with age-related disorders? How can we enhance existing computational models for predicting genome-phenome relationships using structural information, and can machine learning on structurally enhanced knowledge graphs reveal new relationships between patient-derived mutations and disease phenotypes? We propose to answer these questions using a variety of approaches including statistical mining of large sequence datasets, molecular dynamics simulations, machine learning, mass spectrometry, biochemical analysis and in vivo assays. Completion of this work is expected to reveal new allosteric sites for targeting pseudokinase and kinase non-catalytic functions in diseases, and significantly advance our understanding of kinase regulatory mechanisms in disease and normal states. Our work will create new tools and resources for knowledge graph mining and provide explainable models for inferring causal relationships linking genomes and phenomes with potential applications in personalized medicine. Finally, the scope and impact of our work will be significantly broadened by participation in studies extending our specialized tools and technological approaches developed for the study of kinases to other biomedically important gene families such as glycosyltransferases and sulfotransferases. Project Narrative Many human diseases including cancer, diabetes, and inflammatory disorders are causally associated with abnormal protein kinase and glycosyltransferase functions. By characterizing the regulatory functions of these proteins in disease and normal states and by developing new tools to predict disease phenotypes from genotypes, the proposed studies will accelerate the targeting of these proteins for drug discovery and personalized medicine.",Unlocking sequence-structure-function-disease relationships in large protein super-families,10086608,R35GM139656,"['Allosteric Regulation ', ' Allosteric Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biology ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cysteine ', ' Half-Cystine ', ' L-Cysteine ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Family ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Maps ', ' Mining ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Oxidation-Reduction ', ' Redox ', ' oxidation reduction reaction ', ' Patients ', ' Phosphotransferases ', ' Kinases ', ' Phosphotransferase Gene ', ' Transphosphorylases ', ' Protein Kinase ', ' ATP-protein phosphotransferase ', ' Kinase Family Gene ', ' glycogen synthase a kinase ', ' hydroxyalkyl protein kinase ', ' phosphorylase b kinase kinase ', ' Proteins ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' sulfotransferase ', ' Work ', ' glycosyltransferase ', ' EC 2.4 ', ' Glycoside Transferases ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' stress response ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Site ', ' Biochemical ', ' Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases ', ' PTK Receptors ', ' Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Gene ', ' Transmembrane Receptor Protein Tyrosine Kinase ', ' Tyrosine Kinase Linked Receptors ', ' Tyrosine Kinase Receptors ', ' Link ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Inflammatory ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Molecular Dynamics Simulation ', ' molecular dynamics ', ' Structure ', ' member ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' drug discovery ', ' small molecule ', ' Address ', ' in vivo ', ' Gene Family ', ' protein function ', ' disease phenotype ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' data integration ', ' Oncogenic ', ' human disease ', ' phenome ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' broadening participation research ', ' Broadening Participation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' knowledge graph ', ' graph knowledge base ', ' graph knowledgebase ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R35,2021,357769,GA-10
"Comprehensive mapping of multimodal chromatin state in single cells PROJECT SUMMARY Many non-Mendelian (polygenic) human genetic diseases involve multiple causal loci in noncoding regions of the genome, implicating mutations in regulatory elements rather than protein-coding genes as the cause of these diseases. Deciphering the etiology of these human genetic diseases requires an understanding of how genes are regulated during development and homeostasis to produce functional cell states. This regulation is encoded both through epigenetic chromatin state, and genetically encoded in the DNA sequence of regulatory elements such as enhancers, promoters, silencers, and insulators. However, these regulatory elements and their activity states in human cells are not resolvable with current technologies. As aberrant gene regulation likely underlies many human diseases, understanding (1) the function of regulatory DNA elements and (2) their activity dynamics during healthy human development are essential. To address these two problems, I propose to: (i) develop new experimental methods to profile multimodal chromatin state in single cells; (ii) identify alterations in regulatory element activation states that guide cell fate choice during human hematopoiesis; (iii) identify the DNA sequence features important for regulatory element function; (iv) build community tools and resources for the analysis of single-cell chromatin data. Together these aims will provide methods and resources for the interrogation of the human functional genome, and the identification of regulatory state dynamics that generate human cell types. To succeed in achieving these aims, I will pursue additional training supported by co-mentors Dr. Rahul Satija (single-cell biology), Dr. Vijay Sankaran (hematopoiesis), Dr. Danny Reinberg (gene regulation), and Dr. David Knowles (machine learning). I have developed a 5-year career development plan that integrates scientific training in hematopoiesis and gene regulation, practical training and mentorship in deep learning, extensive leadership training through courses and mentorship, and seminars and workshops on academic writing. My team of scientific mentors will provide further guidance and mentorship in academic job searches. The New York Genome Center is an ideal environment for research and further career development, providing the cutting-edge research facilities and opportunities for further career development in a rich interdisciplinary environment. Completion of the proposed research program and career development plan will launch my independent scientific career as a leader in the field of single-cell epigenomics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Information in the human genome encodes a multitude of functional cell states. How this information is decoded to produce these states, and how aberrant encodings produce aberrant states, is not well known. This project aims to develop a suite of experimental and computational methods to identify the changes in regulatory states that occur during hematopoiesis and predict how changes to the genome

"A Technique for Measuring Transcription Factor Activity Summary  Almost every division of NIH has invested heavily in understanding transcription factors (TFs). TFs are the managers of the cell, controlling everything from cell type to cellular response to stress. With their great power, it is no wonder, many human disorders (cancer, familial platelet disorder, Waardenburg syndrome, etc.) result from mutations in transcription factors. Moreover, over 75% of disease causing variants within the human genome reside in regulatory regions, which are dense with TF binding sites. Currently we can measure the location of TF binding, but binding does not equate with regulatory activity. Furthermore, binding analysis is conducted one TF at a time. What is desperately needed is a technology that is able to measure the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. We have developed a novel approach, called eRNA proﬁling, that leverages enhancer RNAs to infer the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. In this grant we seek to optimize our technology, making eRNA proﬁling more accurate, fast and broadly applicable. Narrative  Transcription factors are important in many human diseases. When transcription factors function they produce eRNAs.

"Linking genome variation to transcriptional network dynamics in human B cells B cells of the immune system are a leading model for the analysis of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and cell type specific transcriptional control mechanisms. They represent a featured mammalian cell state in the ENCODE project for in depth chromatin and transcription factor profiling. Furthermore, the loci encoding the antibody heavy and light chain genes (IgH and IgL) have been used to uncover novel mechanisms of somatic DNA recombination and hypermutation that enable the generation of highly diverse antibody repertoires and affinity maturation in response to pathogen encounters or vaccines. Importantly, variation in the human B cell regulatory genome has been associated with autoimmune diseases and vaccine responses. In spite of these impressive advances, there has not been a comprehensive attempt to delineate the cis-regulome of primary human B cells in their resting, activated and terminally differentiated states or to assemble a signaling induced gene regulatory network that controls the activation dynamics and differentiation of B cells. This has impeded efforts to systematically analyze the consequences of genomic variation on the structure and temporal dynamics of the underlying B cell regulatory network in human health and disease. Based on our success in assembling the first comprehensive cis-regulome for primary murine B cells by coupling structural and functional genomics, an inter-disciplinary team is proposing to address the two major challenges highlighted above for human B cells. Thus, we hope to advance a generalizable framework for analyzing the causal connections between human genome variation and dynamic gene network regulation in diverse biological contexts.

"The impact of genomic variation on environment-induced changes in pancreatic beta cell states PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Pancreatic beta cells secrete insulin in order to maintain blood glucose homeostasis. Insulin secretion is tightly regulated by glucose and modulated by numerous environmental signals, including other nutrients, hormones, and inflammatory cytokines. Exposure of beta cells to environmental signals affects gene regulatory programs within hours, and these signal-dependent changes serve to adapt insulin secretion to changes in organismal states. Genetic variants associated with measures of insulin secretion are strongly enriched in genomic elements active in beta cells, and many of these variants are also associated with risk of diabetes. Beta cells therefore possess characteristics that make them an ideal cellular model for studying signal-dependent gene regulatory processes relevant to human health and disease. However, the specific genomic programs that drive signal- induced state changes in beta cells remain poorly characterized. Recent advances in the development of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived multi-cellular islet organoid models by us and others provide a genetically tractable beta cell model for linking genomic activity to cellular phenotypes. Our group has further pioneered the development of numerous single cell assays, including chromatin accessibility, ultra-high-throughput paired chromatin accessibility and gene expression, and paired 3D chromatin interactions and DNA methylation; methods that we have successfully applied to both primary human islets and hPSC-islet organoids. We have further developed machine learning and network-based approaches for variant interpretation including from single cell RNA and epigenetic data. In this proposal we will develop novel gene regulatory network (GRN) models to predict network-level relationships among genomic elements, genes, and phenotypes derived from single cell multiomic maps charting signal- and time-dependent changes in hPSC-islet organoids. In Sections B and C we will measure genomic element activity, gene expression, and insulin secretion in hPSC-islet organoids exposed to ten different secretory signals each across four time points using paired single nucleus accessible chromatin and gene expression and paired single cell DNA methylation and 3D chromatin architecture assays. In Section D we will generate a GRN from these data, use machine learning to infer element-gene and element-phenotype relationships and use the trained models to refine the GRN. From the resulting GRN we will predict the effects of genetic variants in specific genomic elements on target gene expression, gene network activity, and cellular phenotype. In Section E we will validate and refine models by using medium-scale CRISPR interference of genomic elements individually and in combination as well as allele-specific gene editing of selected glucose-associated variants in hPSC-islet organoids and measuring gene expression changes in cis and trans. Together, the results, data, and methods from this project using a model of a cell type which both rapidly responds to environmental signals and has a quantifiable phenotypic output will be widely applicable to the community studying the dynamics of genomic regulation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Fine-tuned regulation of insulin secretion by pancreatic islet beta cells in response to environmental signals is critical for human health and survival. Our proposal will apply systematic, single cell-resolved multiomic data collection in human pluripotent stem cell-derived islet organoids exposed to secretory signals to predict and validate

"ImmGen: Gene Expression and Regulation in Immune Cells The Immunological Genome Project (ImmGen) is a collaborative group of 15 Immunology and Computational Biology laboratories who perform, under standardized conditions, a thorough dissection of gene expression and its regulation in the mouse immune system. We also investigated how these respond to cytokines and immunologic challenges, how immune gene expression relates to chromatin configuration, and used cutting-edge computational algorithms to deduce regulatory connections. ImmGen data are publicly available on dedicated web and smartphone supports, using interactive graphic displays that make the results intuitive to users. These are now frequently used by the Immunology research community. The proposed continuation will harness the collective expertise of the ImmGen group to further develop this important public resource. (1) Expand and deepen the compendium, applying single-cell RNAseq to define very broadly the cast of cell-types at play in the immune system, their trajectories of differentiation, and their adaptation to specific organismal locations This effort will be complemented by deeper bulk profiling of cell-types thus identified. We will expand the analysis of cytokine signatures, continue to chart non-coding RNA (circRNAs), and persue the “OpenSource” program of coordinated sample contributions from the community. (2) Mechanistic Dissection of Immunogenomic Regulatory Networks focusing on a Core Set of 14 cell-types that represent all the major immunological lineages. We will generate high-resolution maps of transcription factor footprints by ultra-deep ATACseq; map 3D architectures by HiC chromosome conformation capture; apply ChIPseq to define enhancers and super-enhancers, chromatin modification domains and structural anchors; use machine learning approaches to integrate these complementary data into a comprehensive regulatory plan which spans from fine TF footprints to topologically associated domaiins; validate these inferences by collaborating with the KOMP project to analyze Core Set transcriptomes and chromatin configuration in mice with mutations in transcription factors that determine functionally relevant facets of immunocyte activity. (3): Public Display. ImmGen data have become a widely used resource in Immunology research, which will be maintained and curated. For scalability, cost-effectiveness, and to enable facile computation, we will develop and deploy cloud-based data storage and access solutions, compliant with NIH Commons guidelines. We will add to the existing databrowsers to allow users to query different facets of the expanding data (differential expression, regulatory network, chromatin states and architecture, cytokine signatures), increasing connectivity to other data sources. We will continue developing the popular mobile app, and explore the particular uses of that medium. ImmGen has positively impacted immunological research in the current decade, providing detailed and rigorous genomic resolution of immune populations, informed by a strong understanding of their immunology.

"Dissecting the transcriptional network governing differentiation of periderm Our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms for orofacial clefting (OFC) is limited by the fact that less than half of the heritable risk for this disorder has been assigned to specific genes. Towards identifying pathological sequence variants among the many irrelevant ones detected in exomes and whole genomes of patients with this disorder, an understanding of the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that govern the development of relevant tissues, including the oral periderm, is essential. We propose a systems biology approach to analyzing the periderm GRN. Using this approach in the past enabled us to identify three novel OFC risk genes. We will utilize two model organisms, zebrafish and mouse, because the periderm differentiation GRN appears to be highly conserved. In zebrafish, the periderm differentiates very early in embryogenesis, greatly facilitating the execution and interpretation of genetic perturbation analyses. Mouse, on the other hand, has the advantage that its craniofacial anatomy is more similar to that of humans. In Aim 1, we will determine the zebrafish periderm differentiation GRN using a state-of-the-art network inference algorithm, NetProphet 2. This tool carries out both a coexpression analysis and a differential expression analysis. Input data sets will include RNA-seq expression profiles we will generate from loss-of-function (LOF) embryos for 4 key transcription factors (TF) known to participate in this GRN. We will also identify the direct gene linkages of these key TFs in the periderm GRN. Finally, we will test a novel candidate member of the periderm GRN, Tead, by carrying out LOF tests in zebrafish, thereby exploiting the strength of this model system. In Aim 2 we will deduce the murine oral periderm differentiation GRN, also using the NetProphet algorithm. Input datasets will include expression profiles of periderm isolated from the palate shelves of wild-type mouse embryos, and from heterozygous mutants of three key TFs: Irf6, Grhl3 and Tfap2a. For each of the mutant genotypes there is evidence of abnormal periderm differentiation. We will also identify murine periderm enhancer candidates by sorting GFP-positive and -negative cells from Krt17-gfp transgenic embryos, performing ATAC-seq on both populations, and H3K27Ac ChIP-seq on cells from palate shelves and the nasal cavity. As in Aim 1, we will also identify the direct gene linkages of the key TFs. We will train a machine learning algorithm on palate periderm enhancers, and use the resulting scoring function to prioritize OFC-associated SNPs near genes that are expressed in periderm for those that are likely to directly affect risk for OFC. Finally, we will perform allele- specific reporter assays on the top candidate SNPs from each of three loci. The expected outcome is a deeper understanding of the specific TFs and cis-regulatory elements that control differentiation of the periderm. This will have a broad impact because it will enable human geneticists to prioritize candidate risk variants that emerge from whole-exome and -genome sequencing analyses of OFC. Orofacial is a common disease with a major impact on the affected individual, their family and society. Here, we will determine the gene regulatory network for periderm, an embryonic tissue that is critical for development of the palate. Our new knowledge will identify candidate genes and help identify pathogenic variants located in regulatory elements which will improve risk assessment and provide new targets for rational therapies.",Dissecting the transcriptional network governing differentiation of periderm,10058264,R01DE023575,"['Pathogenesis ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' Palate ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' embryonic loss ', ' Embryo Loss ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Embryonic Tissue ', ' embryo tissue ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Mammalian Genetics ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' in vivo ', ' Periderm ', ' Tissue Differentiation ', ' Wild Type Mouse ', ' wildtype mouse ', ' Pathologic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' oral cavity epithelium ', ' oral epithelia ', ' oral epithelium ', ' paralogous gene ', ' paralog ', ' genome wide association study ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' orofacial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' loss of function mutation ', ' Heritability ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' loss of function ', ' network models ', ' exome ', ' exomes ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' risk variant ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk allele ', ' risk gene ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk loci ', ' risk locus ', ' Structural Congenital Anomalies ', ' Structural Birth Defect ', ' congenital structural malformation ', ' orofacial cleft ', ' orofacial clefting ', ' ATAC-seq ', ' ATACseq ', ' differential expression ', ' differentially expressed ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' model building ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' support vector machine ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Elements ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Epidermis ', ' Family ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Differentiated Gene ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Genotype ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Nasal cavity ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Vertebrates ', ' Vertebrate Animals ', ' vertebrata ', ' Zebrafish ', ' Brachydanio rerio ', ' Danio rerio ', ' Zebra Danio ', ' Zebra Fish ', ' Enhancers ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Public Domains ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' Reporter ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Oral ', ' Outcome Study ', ' craniofacies ', ' craniofacial ', ' mutant ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' transgenic ', ' Transgenic Organisms ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' CDH1 ', ' CDHE ', ' LCAM ', ' CDH1 gene ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2021,560204,IA-02
"REDfly: The regulatory sequence resource for Drosophila and other insects We have developed a unique resource, the REDfly (Regulatory Element Database for Fly) database of transcriptional regulatory elements, to provide regulatory annotation for the genome of Drosophila and other insects. The genomic sequences regulating gene expression—transcriptional cis-regulatory modules (CRMs, e.g. “enhancers”) and transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs)—are not currently curated by any other major database resources. This is a serious deficiency as CRMs play critical roles with respect to birth defects and chronic diseases as well as normal development, phenotypic variation, and evolution. Knowledge of experimentally validated CRMs and TFBSs is vital for many areas of research including interpretation and validation of data developed by large-scale genomics projects, providing training data for machine-learning CRM- discovery methods, genome annotation, modeling gene regulatory networks, studying the evolution of gene regulation, and numerous aspects of the basic biology of transcriptional regulation. Knowledge of insect CRMs is also an important step in developing biotechnology methods for control of insect disease vectors and for eliminating pathogen transmission. REDfly includes experimentally verified CRMs and TFBSs along with their DNA sequence, their associated genes, and the expression patterns they direct. It is the most detailed existing platform for metazoan regulatory element annotation and is widely acknowledged as the premier resource in the regulatory genomics arena. Only REDfly integrates all of the available insect cis-regulatory information from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive collection of regulatory elements. The objectives of this proposal are to keep REDfly up to date with the rapidly increasing numbers of CRMs and TFBSs being identified and to update the REDfly site to maximize its utility to the research community. The focus is on: (1) Curation. REDfly will continue to be kept up-to-date as new studies are published, and valuable data and metadata will be added to existing records. (2) User interface. We will develop more sophisticated search, display, and download capabilities to keep pace with the vastly increased amounts and types of data now contained in the database. We will update software components that have become obsolete in the decade since their initial implementation. (3) Data integration. We will increase integration of disparate data types and develop confidence scores for annotations. (4) Workflow. We will increase our curation efficiency and ability through improved workflows. (5) Ontology support. We will improve how we use biomedical ontologies through incorporating the latest ontology- related software, including ontology browsers and SPARQL queries. The proposed activities are significant as they will keep up-to-date a high-value resource for multiple research communities and increase REDfly’s utility by adding needed new features and functions. REDfly has already demonstrated its essential and unique value as an important platform for supporting hypothesis-driven empirical and computational research in multiple research areas. It will have greatly increased impact through the updates and enhancements proposed here. The proposed research is relevant to public health because gene regulatory sequences have been linked to birth defects and both chronic and acute diseases. Knowledge of such sequences in insects is also critical in devising means for insect biocontrol and controlling insect-transmitted pathogens. The REDfly database is of proven value in contributing to our understanding of regulatory sequences by serving as a significant source of raw data for analysis, hypothesis generation, assessment and validation, and empirical research in a wide spectrum of important research areas spanning molecular and developmental biology, genetics, genomics, and bioinformatics.",REDfly: The regulatory sequence resource for Drosophila and other insects,10267371,U24GM142435,"['Congenital Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Malformation ', ' Acute Disease ', ' acute disease/disorder ', ' acute disorder ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Arthropods ', ' Arthropoda ', ' Attention ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Biology ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Developmental Biology ', ' Drosophila genus ', ' Drosophila ', ' fruit fly ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Evolution ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Goals ', ' Insect Control ', ' Insecta ', ' Insects ', ' Insects Invertebrates ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Paper ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Generations ', ' Enhancers ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Biocontrols ', ' Genetic ', ' Staging ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Empirical Research ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Structure ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Data ', ' Ectopic Expression ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Collection ', ' Ontology ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' fly ', ' Flies ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' Expression Signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' gene expression signature ', ' transcriptional profile ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' model organisms databases ', ' data integration ', ' pathogen ', ' Drosophila genome ', ' fruit fly genome ', ' user-friendly ', ' biomedical ontology ', ' genome annotation ', ' genome browser ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' ontology development ', ' insect disease vector ', ' ']",NIGMS,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,U24,2021,471718,NY-26
"Genomic control of gene regulatory networks governing early human lineage decisions ABSTRACT  Predicting the impact of genomic variation requires quantitative modeling to deconstruct the interplay between multiple individual variants and to determine their combined effects on gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that control cell state and cell function. We focus on the GRNs that control early human development as a paradigm. Arguably the most important lineage decision during mammalian development is the decision of epiblast cells to exit the pluripotent state (a state when the cells have the potential to give rise to all somatic cells and germ cells), and differentiate into one of the three primary germ layers, the endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm. This pluripotent state and the trilineage differentiation can be captured using cultured human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Much attention has focused on the GRNs underlying the maintenance of the self-renewing pluripotent state, but the GRNs governing hESC trilineage differentiation remain largely unexplored. We previously conducted genome-scale CRISPR/Cas screens to discover protein-coding genes that regulate the transition of hESCs to definitive endoderm. Based on the genomic and genetic data and machine learning (gkm-SVM sequence analysis), we expanded our initial simple two transcription factor (TF) model to a multiple TF cooperative model. Here we propose an integrative approach examining the hESC transition to definitive endoderm, mesoderm and neuroectoderm germ layer identities to improve the generalizability of GRN models. We will perform quantitative genomic and proteomic measurements with high temporal and single-cell resolution. These quantitative measurements will be combined with perturbation of key GRN elements, core TFs and their target enhancers, to inform the generation of dynamic GRN models. To further improve the precision of our new GRN models, we will map cell trajectories during state transitions through lineage tracing combined with scRNA-seq. Beyond hESC guided differentiation, the physiological relevance of enhancers will be further interrogated in human and mouse organoids (gastruloids) and mouse embryos. We will then apply innovative new computational and algorithmic methods to our multimodal experimental data to generate GRN models, aiming to learn generalizable principles underlying the contribution of genomic variants to cellular and ultimately organismal phenotypes. Developing GRN models for the exit of pluripotency and the acquisition of germ layer identities involves dynamic modeling of the cell state transition, which will not only inform our understanding of early human development, but can also serve as the basis for construction of generalizable GRN models for biological transitions during embryonic development, adult tissue homeostasis and regeneration as well as inappropriate cell fate transitions that occur in pathological conditions such as cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE)  This project will construct models of gene regulatory networks controlling early human development by taking an integrative approach involving perturbation of core regulatory network elements, quantitative genomic and proteomic measurements with high temporal and single-cell resolution, and systems level analyses.

"Using Syntenic Gapped-kmer Composition to Detect Conserved Enhancers where Sequence Alignment Fails While thousands of genomic loci have been associated with common human disease, translating these disease associations to clinical impact is often limited by lack of appropriate human cell lines and our inability to unambiguously identify orthologous regulatory regions for studies in model organisms. Sequence alignment, the most frequently used method to detect evolutionary conservation of enhancers and promoters, accurately identifies genes and promoters, but often fails to detect many functionally conserved distal enhancers, in spite of the fact that orthologous TFs generally have conserved binding activity. We have developed a machine learning approach to identify the set of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) active in cell-type specific enhancers from epigenomic data using a gapped-kmer features that encompasses all possible TFBS (gkm-SVM), and this classifier can distinguish active enhancers from non-active regions. This DNA sequence based model can accurately predict enhancer activity in massively parallel reporter assays and the impact of variation in regulatory elements associated with human disease (deltaSVM). The central aim of this proposal is to develop a new computational method using the syntenic gapped-kmer composition to detect functionally conserved regulatory elements missed by conventional sequence alignment methods. Previous studies of enhancer evolution across mammals using sequence alignment have reported that promoters are more conserved than enhancers, and that enhancers are evolving rapidly. In contrast, using gapped k-mers, we find that cell-type specific enhancers and promoters in matched ENCODE/Roadmap tissues are equally functionally conserved, and that gapped k-mers can identify conserved enhancers that are undetectable by sequence alignment. We hypothesize that the improvements relative to sequence alignment methods arise because the gapped-kmer feature space is able to detect similarity between rearrangements and variations of TF binding sites which may vary at gapped positions but which retain similar binding affinities. We will develop a method to detect conserved regulatory regions using the gkm-SVM kernel as a metric of sequence conservation and optimize this method by comparing to genome-wide functional data. We will then develop algorithms to detect long range syntenic intervals of similar gapped k-mer composition and generate genome- wide maps of evolutionary conservation. We will validate the predictions with CRISPRi in human and mouse stem cells differentiated to endoderm. We propose to develop methods to use syntenic gapped-kmer sequence composition to generate maps of evolutionarily conserved regulatory regions and validate these predictions in human and mouse. This project will significantly contribute to our understanding of regulatory element constraint and evolution and will significantly enhance our ability use model organisms to study how human genetic variation contributes to common disease.",Using Syntenic Gapped-kmer Composition to Detect Conserved Enhancers where Sequence Alignment Fails,10480233,R56HG012110,"['Algorithms ', ' Base Sequence ', ' Nucleotide Sequence ', ' nucleic acid sequence ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Endoderm ', ' Evolution ', ' Genes ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Hybrids ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Promoter Regions ', ' Promotor Regions ', ' genetic promoter element ', ' genetic promoter sequence ', ' promoter sequence ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Translating ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Sequence Alignment ', ' sequencing alignment ', ' Guide RNA ', ' gRNA ', ' Enhancers ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' Repetitive Sequence ', ' Repetitive Element ', ' Repetitive Regions ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' jun Oncogene ', ' JUN ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Distal ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Active Sites ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Reporter ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cell type ', ' ES cell ', ' stem cell of embryonic origin ', ' embryonic stem cell ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' heuristics ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' Human Cell Line ', ' DPC4 ', ' Deleted in Pancreatic Carcinoma ', ' Drosophila Homolog of Mothers Against Decapentaplegic 4 ', ' MADH4 ', ' SMA- and MAD-Related Protein 4 ', ' SMAD4 ', ' MADH4 gene ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' hESC ', ' human ES cell ', ' human ESC ', ' human embryonic stem cell ', ' JV18 ', ' JV18-1 ', ' MADH2 ', ' MADR2 ', ' SMAD2 ', ' MADH2 gene ', ' Ortholog ', ' Orthologous Gene ', ' Affinity ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Validation ', ' Modification ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' stem cell differentiation ', ' epigenomics ', ' knock-down ', ' knockdown ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' human disease ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' screening ', ' ATAC-seq ', ' ATACseq ', ' SOX17 gene ', ' SOX17 ', ' SRY-Related HMG-Box Gene 17 ', ' CRISPR interference ', ' CRISPRi ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats interference ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' genomic locus ', ' gene locus ', ' genetic locus ', ' ']",NHGRI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R56,2021,388975,MD-07
"Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This research program aims to bridge the gap between genomics data generation from clinical samples and our ability to infer and interpret intricate regulatory programs that underpin cell function and dysfunction in human cells. The Ucar laboratory develops and applies computational solutions to uncover complex regulatory programs in human cells and address previously inaccessible questions related to how disruptions in these programs affect human health and disease. The goal is to create computational tools that are versatile, easy to use and in keeping with the ever-increasing sophistication and complexity of NGS data. The current focus on the immunobiology of aging leverages the Principal Investigator's extensive training in computer science, epigenomics, and aging biology. Ongoing work with collaborators at The Jackson Laboratory and The University of Connecticut Health Center has led to multiple discoveries related to the genomic signatures of human immune aging, and has yielded numerous questions that form the basis for the proposed research program, including: 1) Which regulatory programs and regulatory interactions are disrupted with aging in which immune cells? 2) How do men and women age differently? 3) What are the putative genomic/clinical/immunological markers of healthy aging? To address these questions, this research program will focus on developing machine learning and network mining algorithms that enable integration of data from diverse sources, since complex regulatory interactions and diverse regulatory elements cannot be inferred from a single data type. Fueled by these tools, it will investigate the dynamics of regulatory programs in blood- derived human immune cells associated with aging through collaborations with clinicians, immunologists, and chromatin scientists.

"A Technique for Measuring Transcription Factor Activity Summary  Almost every division of NIH has invested heavily in understanding transcription factors (TFs). TFs are the managers of the cell, controlling everything from cell type to cellular response to stress. With their great power, it is no wonder, many human disorders (cancer, familial platelet disorder, Waardenburg syndrome, etc.) result from mutations in transcription factors. Moreover, over 75% of disease causing variants within the human genome reside in regulatory regions, which are dense with TF binding sites. Currently we can measure the location of TF binding, but binding does not equate with regulatory activity. Furthermore, binding analysis is conducted one TF at a time. What is desperately needed is a technology that is able to measure the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. We have developed a novel approach, called eRNA proﬁling, that leverages enhancer RNAs to infer the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. In this grant we seek to optimize our technology, making eRNA proﬁling more accurate, fast and broadly applicable. Narrative  Transcription factors are important in many human diseases. When transcription factors function they produce eRNAs. We have developed a prototype technique that leverages eRNAs to infer the activity of all TF in a cell simultaneously.",A Technique for Measuring Transcription Factor Activity,10204040,R01GM125871,"['Algorithms ', ' Antibodies ', ' Behavior ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Engineering ', ' Estradiol ', ' Aquadiol ', ' Dimenformon ', ' Diogyn ', ' Diogynets ', ' Estrace ', ' Estradiol-17 beta ', ' Estradiol-17beta ', ' Estraldine ', ' Ovocyclin ', ' Ovocylin ', ' Progynon ', ' Therapeutic Estradiol ', ' Genes ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Post-Translational Protein Processing ', ' Post-Translational Modification Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Post-Translational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Protein Modification ', ' Posttranslational Modifications ', ' Posttranslational Protein Processing ', ' Protein Modification ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Research ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Waardenburg syndrome ', "" Waardenburg's syndrome "", ' dyschromia iridocutanea et dysplasia auditiva ', ' van der Hoeve Halbertsona Waardenburg syndrome ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Enhancers ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Stimulus ', ' Reporter ', ' cooking ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' experience ', ' Isoforms ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' novel ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' ChIP assay ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation ', ' Polymerase ', ' ESR1 ', ' Estrogen Receptor 1 ', ' NR3A1 ', ' ESR1 gene ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' human disease ', ' prototype ', ' disease-causing mutation ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' Drug Screening ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' Familial Platelet Disorder ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R01,2021,287610,CO-02
"Defining interaction quantitative trait loci (iQTLs) in the human genome Abstract My research aims to understand the role of three-dimensional (3D) chromatin structure in gene regulation. This involves studying associations among genotype, histone modifications, transcription factor binding, non-coding RNAs, chromatin interactions and gene expression. In order to transform this genome-wide information into new biological discoveries, my laboratory develops scalable and interpretable computational methods based on statistics, graph theory and machine learning. Our recent focus is to address an important gap in the current knowledge of the role of 3D chromatin structure in gene regulation. That is, we aim to define how genotypic variation affects 3D organization of gene promoters, and in turn, their expression. To achieve this at a genome- wide scale is an ambitious goal, because it requires having at a minimum, genotype, gene expression and chromatin interaction profiles in pure populations of specific cell types from a large number of donors. However, my laboratory is uniquely positioned to perform this research because: i) we are involved in a study at the La Jolla Institute (LJI-R24AI108564) that has already genotyped ~100 donors and expression-profiled more than 15 different pure populations of human immune cell types, and we have access to the same samples for chromatin interaction mapping, ii) in collaboration with other groups at LJI, we have already discovered a prototypical example of an interaction quantitative trait locus (iQTL) that alters and rewires interactions from the promoter of a specific gene that is associated with asthma susceptibility, iii) we have the necessary expertise and proven track record in experimental design and computational analyses of various chromatin conformation capture assays. Leveraging the resources available at LJI and our expertise in the field, we will build a unique research program around the novel concept of iQTLs. The emerging set of three main questions we propose to address within the next five years are: Q1) How do we define cell-type-specific iQTLs for common genetic variants? Q2) What is the extent of overlap between iQTLs and GWAS SNPs? Q3) Can we build predictive models for the cell-type specificity of chromatin interactions and iQTLs? Although we propose to define iQTLs only in two abundant, easily accessible, and highly disease-relevant immune cell types, the concept of iQTLs is equally important in other cell types implicated in diseases with a genetic component. Hence, the proof-of-concept developed by this work, without a doubt, will open up a new field in studying a previously uncharacterized role for disease-susceptibility variants, specifically non-coding SNPs, from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in gene regulation. Narrative Recent discoveries that allow us to look beyond the one-dimensional sequence of DNA and understand the large-scale organization principals of its three-dimensional folding have been limited when it comes to characterizing the role of fine-scale genetic variations of the DNA code in controlling important cellular processes such as gene expression. This work will employ state-of-the-art molecular biology techniques and develop novel computational methods to define the role of such genetic variants in changing three-dimensional connections made by the promoters of genes in the human genome. This systematic and unbiased genome- wide study will have important implications in changing the way we study the disease relevance of genetic variation by revealing genotype dependence of long-range chromatin interactions between genes and their distal control switches at a scale that has not been achieved to date.",Defining interaction quantitative trait loci (iQTLs) in the human genome,10226063,R35GM128938,"['Affect ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Chromatin ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease susceptibility ', ' Diathesis ', ' liability to disease ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' Distal ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Dependence ', ' cell type ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' QTL ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Sampling ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' histone modification ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' Molecular Biology Techniques ', ' Chromatin Structure ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Gene Structure ', ' Gene Organization ', ' Gene Structure/Organization ', ' genes structure ', ' genome wide association study ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Population ', ' Susceptibility Gene ', ' Predisposition gene ', ' predisposing gene ', ' susceptibility allele ', ' susceptibility locus ', ' susceptibility variant ', ' genome-wide analysis ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' graph theory ', ' chromosome conformation capture ', ' 3C-based approach ', ' 3C-based assay ', ' 3C-based method ', ' 3C-based strategy ', ' 3C-based technique ', ' 3C-based technology ', ' chromatin conformation capture ', ' chromosome capture ', ' ']",NIGMS,LA JOLLA INSTITUTE FOR IMMUNOLOGY,R35,2021,449649,CA-52
"Statistical modeling of long-range chromatin interactions on gene regulation and underlying molecular Disease-associated genetic variants have been found to be enriched in regulatory genomic regions of gene expression. In order to gain detailed understanding of disease mechanisms, one central question is to systematically delineate how tissue-specific gene expression programs are regulated. Enhancers are a major family of regulatory elements with complex signatures and they are abundant in the human genome. Enhancer regulation of gene expression is highly tissue-specific, associated with combinatorial transcription factor binding, and involved with long-range three-dimensional chromatin interactions. It is therefore challenging to characterize the large-scale enhancer regulatory networks. The primary goal of this project is to develop a suite of probabilistic models and efficient machine learning algorithms to predict genome-wide enhancer regulatory networks in diverse panels of cellular contexts and the associated molecular mechanisms to establish long-range interactions, which will be leveraged to interpret disease-associated genetic variants. In Aim 1, novel integrative graphical models will be developed to predict long-range chromatin interactions linking tissue-specific enhancers to their distal target genes, along with combinatorial transcription factor binding patterns. In Aim 2, computational algorithms will be designed to interrogate how specific chromatin interactions are established, leading to mechanistic insights on chromatin formation. In Aim 3, statistical models will be developed to integrate enhancer-gene regulatory networks with genetics data to predict which non-coding variants may disrupt regulatory links and cause diseases, with improved statistical power and accuracy. This modeling framework will substantially expand the analytical ability on non-coding variants and human disease mechanisms. Computational predictions from the three aims will be experimentally tested in mouse models of breast cancer development. This project will lead to both innovative computational tools and systematic biological insights on long-range enhancer regulation and their functional roles in human diseases. The advanced statistical models and machine learning algorithms will provide efficient big-data integration tools for epigenetics, gene regulation and human genetics. Comprehensive predictions from this project represent valuable platforms to delineate genetic variants and disease mechanisms.

"Computational modeling of spatial genome organization and gene regulation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The three-dimensional (3D) organization of the genome plays an essential role in genome stability, gene regulation, and many diseases, including cancer. The recent development of high-throughput chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) and its variants provide an unprecedented opportunity to investigate higher-order chromatin organization. Despite the rapidly accumulating resources for investigating 3D genome organization, our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms and functions of the genome organization remain largely incomplete. Hi-C analyses and 3D genome research are still in their early stage and face several challenges. First, high-resolution chromatin contact maps require extremely deep sequencing and hence have been achieved only for a few cell lines. Second, it is computationally challenging to complement 3D genome structure with one-dimensional (1D) genomic and epigenomic features. Third, recent studies have just begun to infer associations between chromatin interactions and genetic variants and to identify potential target genes of those variants at the genome-wide scale. Given these challenges and my unique multi-disciplinary training, my long-term research goal is to develop innovative computational and statistical methods to uncover the interplay between 3D genome structure and function. Speciﬁcally, in the next ﬁve years, I will i) develop computational approaches to enhance the resolution of existing Hi-C data and investigate ﬁne-scale 3D genome architecture as well as its spatiotemporal dynamics and ii) build scalable and interpretable machine learning models that leverage 1D epigenomic data to predict cell type-speciﬁc 3D chromatin interactions and gene expression and elucidate the function of 3D genome organization in gene regulation and human diseases. The completion of the proposed work will deepen our knowledge of 3D genome architecture as well as its functions in gene regulation and disease.
