"Estimating Cholera Burden with Cross-sectional Immunologic Data Project Summary/Abstract Cholera is an acute dehydrating diarrheal disease caused by infection with Vibrio cholerae. It is endemic in over 50 countries, affecting up to 3 million people and causing more than 100,000 deaths annually. A renewed global effort to fight cholera is underway, catalyzed by the large on-going epidemic in Haiti and now aided by new generation oral cholera vaccines. Identifying key populations at high risk of cholera is essential to guide these activities. Current methods to estimate cholera burden are largely based on clinical reporting with infrequent microbiological confirmation. These methods are limited by the sporadic nature of outbreaks, poor surveillance infrastructure, and fundamental uncertainties in the number of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases. Improved methods of detecting cholera exposure and risk are urgently needed. Detection of immune responses in serum (serosurveillance) can provide a new avenue for rapid and accurate estimates of cholera exposure and risk. We currently do not understand what immunological and clinical parameters are most predictive of recent exposure, nor whether immune responses in areas with different levels of endemicity are similar. In preliminary studies, we have used machine learning methods on antibody response data from cholera patients in Bangladesh to classify whether individuals had been exposed in the previous 30-, 90-, or 360-days with high sensitivity and specificity. In this application, we propose to use longitudinal antibody response kinetics, from populations with diverse genetic and epidemiologic profiles, paired with novel statistical and machine learning approaches to provide generalizable tools to estimate the incidence of exposure to Vibrio cholerae from cross sectional serosurveys. In Aim 1, we will develop models to estimate the time since exposure to Vibrio cholerae and exposure incidence from cross-sectional antibody profiles and demographic data using previously collected data from a cohort in Bangladesh. These results will allow us to identify the antibodies and demographic factors that are most useful for prediction of time-since-exposure. In Aim 2, we will collect longitudinal antibody data from a cohort of cholera cases and household contacts in Haiti to develop models for estimating exposure incidence from cross-sectional serosurveillance. This cohort will also enable us to compare the models developed for moderate/severe cases and mild/asymptomatic cases. In Aim 3, we will optimize and validate field-adapted methods to measure cholera-specific antibodies, including the use of dried blood spot and lateral flow assays. We will conduct a proof-of-concept cross-sectional serosurvey using these methods in rural Haiti. Upon the completion of these aims, we will have provided a number of new tools for measure of susceptibility to cholera in a population. These tools will have the potential to transform cholera control efforts from the current reactive strategies to proactive ones, with the potential to contribute to disease elimination. Project Narrative Cholera is a diarrheal disease affecting millions of people worldwide each year, with the majority of deaths due to cholera occurring in places with poor disease surveillance infrastructure. To optimize cholera control efforts, accurate estimates of cholera exposure and risk are needed. We propose studies using computational methods to determine how antibody decay data may help us estimate cholera exposure incidence.",Estimating Cholera Burden with Cross-sectional Immunologic Data,10132972,R01AI135115,"['Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Antibodies ', ' Bangladesh ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cholera ', ' Cholera Vaccine ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Diarrhea ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Future ', ' Haiti ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' care facilities ', ' Household ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Joints ', ' Kinetics ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Microbiology ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Sanitation ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Specificity ', ' Standardization ', ' statistics ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Vibrio cholerae ', ' V cholerae ', ' V. cholerae ', ' Vibrio comma ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Caring ', ' Immunology ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Serology ', ' Link ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Logistics ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Spottings ', ' Genetic ', ' V cholerae O1 ', ' V cholerae Serogroup O1 ', ' V. cholerae O1 ', ' V. cholerae Serogroup O1 ', ' Vibrio cholerae Serogroup O1 ', ' Vibrio cholerae O1 ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' fighting ', ' Oral ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Surveillance Methods ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Immunologics ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologically ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' pathogen ', ' Population ', ' high risk ', ' Antibody Response ', ' Haitian ', ' Bangladeshi ', ' Vibrio cholerae infection ', ' Infection with V cholerae ', ' Infection with V. cholerae ', ' Infection with Vibrio cholerae ', ' V cholerae infection ', ' V. cholerae infection ', ' cholera infection ', ' infected with cholera ', ' infection with cholera ', ' Disease Surveillance ', ' Infrastructure ', ' diarrheal disease ', ' diarrheal illness ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' lateral flow assay ', ' lateral flow test ', ' serosurveillance ', ' serology surveillance ', ' serosurvey ', ' serology survey ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2021,663407,UT-02
"Antibody isotyping for discrimination of disease stage and diagnosis of early Lyme disease. ABSTRACT More than 3 million tests are performed each year to support the laboratory diagnosis of human Lyme disease (LD). While the CDC conventional standard two-tier (CSTT) approach for serodiagnosis of LD has worked relatively well when used as recommended, there is plenty of room for improvement. Of a number of weaknesses associated with the supplemental immunoblot of the CSTT the most significant is low reproducibility due to the subjective visual interpretation of results. To overcome these weaknesses the CDC recently updated its recommendations based on a modified STT (MSTT) in that a second EIA can replace the immunoblot. The major goal of this project is to develop an objective, quantitative, multiplex EIA that can detect four antibody isotypes (IgM/D/G/A) and all four IgG subclasses (IgG1/2/3/4) to leverage acquisition of simultaneous antibody profile information on multiple B. burgdorferi antigens to build an assay that can discriminate Lyme disease stage with increased overall sensitivity without incurring in loss of specificity. The novelty of this study relies on: 1) evaluation of B. burgdorferi antigen-specific antibody isotypes and IgG subclasses that can be correlated with Lyme disease stage; and 2) development of new diagnostic tools using machine learning techniques to train and integrate all data and produce an objective result to discriminate early Lyme from early disseminated/late Lyme disease. We expect this Phase I SBIR to allow us to develop a new EIA for serodiagnosis of Lyme disease (isoEIAplex-Ld) and to further an ongoing collaboration with DCN diagnostics for the adaptation of our biomarkers to a new rapid Lateral Flow Assay (see Letter of Support) for a follow up Phase II SBIR .

"Defining humoral correlates of immunity against COVID-19 Since 2002, several coronaviruses have emerged able to cause severe respiratory disease, however no vaccine is available to prevent these rapidly spreading pathogens. Vaccine design has specifically lagged due to our lack of understanding of the correlates of immunity against these pathogens. Both cellular and humoral immune responses have been implicated in resolution of disease, but to date only the passive transfer of antibodies has been shown to confer complete protection in mice. Interestingly, the transfer of both “neutralizing” and nonneutralizing antibodies have shown protective efficacy, highlighting the role of multiple humoral mechanisms in limiting viral infection/spread. The precise mechanism of action of these antibodies that have the most profound impact on limiting disease is currently unclear, but if elucidated could provide critical insights for the development of effective vaccines against COVID-19 and other coronaviruses. Thus, here we aim to take a systematic approach to dissect and define both the polyclonal and monoclonal mechanisms by which antibodies confer protection against COVID-19. Specifically, samples from DNA- and adenovirus 26 (Ad26)- COVID-19 Spike protein (S) immunized animals, that will be challenged with COVID-19, will be comprehensively profiled using Systems Serology, to define the functional humoral immune responses linked to protection from infection/disease in mice, ferrets, and macaques. Machine learning modeling will be employed to discern key immune response features that translate usefully across these diverse animal contexts. These studies will not only define correlates of immunity across vaccines and species, but also provide mechanistic insights into the precise mechanisms by which antibodies may confer protection in the context of future vaccines. Collectively, these studies will provide the first insights on the cross-species correlates of immunity against COVID-19 to support the development of vaccines. Additionally, this work may also lead to the development of novel therapeutics with unique immunomodulatory impact on viral infection/disease",Defining humoral correlates of immunity against COVID-19,10265799,R37AI080289,"['Adenoviruses ', ' Adenoviridae ', ' Animals ', ' Antibodies ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Ferrets ', ' Future ', ' Immunity ', ' Infection ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' disease of the lung ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' Macaca ', ' Macaque ', ' Macaca mulatta ', ' M mulatta ', ' M. mulatta ', ' Rhesus Macaque ', ' Rhesus Monkey ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Translating ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' viral infection ', ' virus infection ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' Work ', ' Serology ', ' Coronavirus ', ' Coronaviridae ', ' corona virus ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' System ', ' develop a vaccine ', ' development of a vaccine ', ' vaccine formulation ', ' vaccine development ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' Passive Antibody Transfers ', ' Passive Transfer of Immunity ', ' Immunomodulation ', ' immune modulation ', ' immune regulation ', ' immunologic reactivity control ', ' immunomodulatory ', ' immunoregulatory ', ' immunoregulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Resolution ', ' Vaccine Design ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' pathogen ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' protective efficacy ', ' Antibody Response ', ' Immunize ', ' COVID-19 ', ' COVID19 ', ' CV-19 ', ' CV19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' SARS-CoV-2 spike protein ', ' 2019-nCoV S protein ', ' 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein ', ' 2019-nCoV spike protein ', ' COVID-19 S protein ', ' COVID-19 spike glycoprotein ', ' COVID-19 spike protein ', ' COVID19 S protein ', ' COVID19 spike glycoprotein ', ' COVID19 spike protein ', ' SARS-CoV-2 S protein ', ' SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein ', ' SARS-CoV2 S protein ', ' SARS-CoV2 spike glycoprotein ', ' SARS-CoV2 spike protein ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 S protein ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike glycoprotein ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike protein ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 S protein ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 spike glycoprotein ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 spike protein ', ' SARS-CoV-2 immunity ', ' COVID-19 immunity ', ' COVID19 immunity ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 immunity ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 immunity ', ' immunity against COVID-19 ', ' immunity against COVID19 ', ' immunity against SARS-CoV-2 ', ' immunity against Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ', ' immunity against coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' immunity to COVID-19 ', ' immunity to COVID19 ', ' immunity to SARS-CoV-2 ', ' immunity to Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ', ' immunity to coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' SARS-CoV-2 infection ', ' COVID-19 infection ', ' COVID19 infection ', ' SARS-CoV2 infection ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 infection ', ' infected with COVID-19 ', ' infected with COVID19 ', ' infected with SARS-CoV-2 ', ' infected with SARS-CoV2 ', ' infected with coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ', ' ']",NIAID,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R37,2021,355594,MA-08
"Software for sequencing human antibody proteins from polyclonal immune responses The natural immune response to foreign pathogens involves a complex coordination of cells, including an adaptive response to select and secrete antibodies into circulation. Individuals who have recovered from a pathogenic infection retain immune memory and continue to circulate pathogen-specific antibodies. For many infectious diseases like respiratory syncytial virus, Ebola, and poxviruses, antibodies with neutralizing activity to multiple viral strains have been discovered from human survivors. The discovered antibodies are highly valuable as potential biologic therapeutics for the broader population, as the antibodies have been naturally optimized to defend against human pathogens.  Efforts to discover antibodies from humans recovering from coronavirus infection are underway, SARS-CoV-2 in particular, but are hampered by the limitations of existing antibody discovery platforms. Current approaches require screening for live B cells actively producing pathogen-specific antibodies, which are sensitive to cell death and rarely found in blood. In contrast, antibody protein is stable and pathogen-reactive antibodies are abundant in serum. While protein is the ideal material to start with, characterization of polyclonal antibody (pAb) protein presents new challenges.  Recent advances in mass spectrometry and analysis have shown individual antibody candidates can be derived from affinity-purified pAb proteins when a sufficiently matched B-cell genetic antibody repertoire is provided. We aim to develop algorithms to supplant the need of a genetic antibody repertoire, and de novo identify antibody candidates from limited complexity pAb samples. This is achieved by improvements to de novo peptide sequencing using machine learning, and targeted assembly of specificity determining regions (CDR3s) and antibody frameworks using de Bruijn graphs. The proposed software will provide estimates of clonal diversity and candidate sequences that can be synthesized and tested for reactivity. In addition to addressing needs for infectious diseases, as demonstrated with an urgent unmet need to stop the COVID-19 pandemic, the software also applies to clinical and biomedical research needs in autoimmune disease, and commercial interests in replacing polyclonal antibody reagents with highly reproducible monoclonal antibody equivalents. The antibody repertoire circulating in serum is the most active component to an immune response, yet is unable to be directly queried without aid from the genetic antibody repertoire from cells. Our innovative algorithms enable querying and sequencing of antibodies directly from protein - opening the door to previously inaccessible autoimmune and infectious disease research and therapeutic

"Neutralization Fingerprinting Analysis of Polyclonal Antibody Responses against HIV-1 Project Summary HIV-1 poses a substantial health and economic burden, with more than 30 million people currently infected worldwide. The search for an effective HIV-1 vaccine remains a top priority, and a deeper understanding of how the immune system recognizes HIV-1 can help inform vaccine design. Lately, much effort has focused on understanding the antibody responses to HIV-1 infection. However, the polyclonal neutralizing antibody responses in an individual are very complex. Standard methods for mapping such responses include various experimental techniques, but more recently, computational methods were also developed. These computational methods, which we call NFP (neutralization fingerprinting), are based on analysis of serum neutralization data that is typically obtained in the very first stages of donor sample characterization, and are therefore an efficient technology for accurately mapping antibody specificities in polyclonal responses. The NFP algorithms have already become an important tool in the HIV field and are being used extensively by laboratories throughout the world, including Duke CHAVI-ID, CAPRISA, NIH VRC, and MHRP.  Here, we propose to develop next-generation NFP algorithms and apply them to address biological questions with important implications for understanding the interactions between HIV-neutralizing antibodies and the virus. Specifically, we will develop and apply novel algorithms for: (1) Antibody specificity prediction with significantly improved accuracy and reliability. These algorithms will immensely improve the utility of the NFP approach for prospective identification of antibody specificities in polyclonal sera. (2) Mapping broadly neutralizing antibody responses against novel epitopes on HIV-1 Env. We will use epitope- structural analysis and computational search algorithms to identify novel Env epitopes, and will screen donor samples for the presence of related NFP signals. Promising signals for novel antibody specificities will be characterized further through collaborations. (3) Population-level analysis of broadly neutralizing antibody responses to HIV-1. We will analyze large collections of samples from diverse HIV infection cohorts in order to determine common antibody specificities elicited in response to HIV-1, as well as patterns of potential association between features of the infecting virus sequence and the elicited epitope specificities.  The proposed NFP algorithms will be made available to the public, and will be useful in a number of high-impact areas in the HIV field, including mapping of antibody specificities in previously uncharacterized samples, identification of novel Env epitopes, and large-scale analysis of broadly neutralizing antibody responses within a cohort, or at a population level. Overall, this work will lead to a better understanding of the neutralizing antibody responses against HIV-1 and will build a more complete picture of the epitopes on Env. The proposed algorithmic framework should be generalizable to other important viruses, such as influenza and hepatitis C, and therefore has the potential for a far-reaching impact on public health.

"Rapid response for pandemics: single cell sequencing and deep learning to predict antibody sequences against an emerging antigen ABSTRACT One of the “holy grails” in immunology is to be able to directly predict tight-binding variable chain antibody sequences in silico against foreign or non-self `antigenic' proteins. Immunoglobulin chain rearrangement can potentially encode approximately 1016 different variants of antibody heavy and light chain sequences. However, only a small fraction of the sequence space is generally accessed for evolving antibodies against foreign proteins. The computational challenge is to go from a model of the structure of an antigen to predicting a set of antibody chain sequences that can bind tightly to the antigen. If solved, it might be possible to move in less than 24 hours from the first cryo-electron-microscopic structure of a novel viral protein to advance a set of potent antibody-like molecular candidates for testing. Towards solving this problem, this project aims to develop a deep learning architecture that will take as input thermodynamic, quantum mechanical (density functional), and local structure- based network topographical features of the antigens and their cognate antibodies, and will output their respective binding affinity constants. We will design a generative adversarial network (GAN), which we think is uniquely suited for regression-based ML approaches for the immune system, to discover associations between the epitope and the variable chain features. This approach requires a large data stream of antigen and cognate antibody sequences, which until recently was difficult to obtain. A recently described single B-cell receptor (BCR) specific tagging method coupled with single cell deep sequencing (“linking B cell receptor to antigen specificity through sequencing” or LIBRA- seq) can rapidly isolate and sequence the BCR variable chain coding regions that can bind with high selectivity to antigenic epitopes. Towards the specific project goals, in Task 1, LIBRA-seq will be used to rapidly identify and generate candidate immunoglobulin coding sequences in response to specific linear and nonlinear epitopes (against controls), chosen through computational/molecular modeling and prioritized with SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein epitopes (but not restricted to these), injected into a mouse model, to generate large training sets; in Task 2, these training sets, along with other data sets already available in public databases, will generate a series of structural features (described above), which will be used to train the GAN; in Task 3, the predicted epitope-antibody interactions will be validated by direct experiments with synthetic antibody and phage-display systems. Thus, the proposed strategy combines foundational principles in evolutionary biology, genomics, structural chemistry, and computer science to the solution of a general biological engineering problem. Results from this project are expected to lay the foundations for a rigorously tested and fully automated machine- learning system that could rapidly generate synthetic antibody candidates from the structure of a novel virus protein, which can enhance the rapid response ability against a future pandemic. The ability to develop targeted antibody therapy against non-infectious or chronic diseases, and on the production of antibody-based industrial enzymes, will also be dramatically enhanced if this project were to be successful. The team: The team-leads of this multi-institutional research project comprise a computer scientist, a protein crystallographer, an immunologist, and a molecular biologist. 1 NARRATIVE The readiness for a future viral pandemic will critically depend on being able to accurately predict, entirely using computers, neutralizing antibody structures directly from the virus's protein structure. Vaccines and therapeutics can then be manufactured and tested with unprecedented rapidity. We propose to make this goal a reality by engaging the advantages of single-cell genomic deep sequencing and the latest advances in deep machine learning.",Rapid response for pandemics: single cell

"Antibodies, B cells and resistance to human cryptococcosis HIV-associated immunosuppression portends high risk for cryptococcal meningitis (CM). Despite progress that has increased HIV testing and anti-retroviral therapy (ART) availability in resource-limited settings, the incidence and mortality of CM remain very high. In addition, ART can elicit immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (C-IRIS), and CM also occurs in HIV- persons, including recipients of solid organ transplants and biologics. There are no host biomarkers to predict which HIV-infected (HIV+) patients will develop CM or C- IRIS. We are interested in the role antibody (Ab) immunity may play in resistance to CM, which is rare in people with intact immunity. We have contributed significant knowledge in this area, including recent data showing lower natural Laminarin (a β-glucan)-binding Ab levels in HIV+ patients with C-IRIS and positive serum cryptococcal antigen tests. Studies of HIV+ and HIV- patients revealed perturbations in Ab repertoires of patients with CM and C-IRIS, and lower IgM memory B cell levels in patients with CM. In mice, IgM memory homologs, B-1 cells and/or naïve IgM enhanced resistance to CM. These cells make Abs that bind microbial carbohydrates, e.g. the β-glucans on the Cn cell wall. The goal of this project is to probe the link between natural Ab and B cell responses to Cn and resistance to CM. We hypothesize CM risk will associate with deficiency of specific Cn- and/or β-glucan-binding Abs, stemming from B cell repertoire pertubations. Our aims are 1] To characterize Cn- and β-glucan-binding Abs of patients with and at risk for CM and C-IRIS, isolate monoclonal antibodies (huMabs) from normal persons and test their efficacy in mouse models. 2] To determine the ability of huMabs and GXM- and β-glucan-binding Abs to 1] exert direct effects on Cn viability and biology, and/or 2] mediate human effector cell Cn phagocytosis and/or killing. 3] To analyze B cell subsets, VH/VL repertoires, and transcriptional pathways of patients with and at risk for CM and C-IRIS, and controls, and use statistical modeling to identify signatures of CM risk. Knowledge gained from this project will inform tools to predict CM and C-IRIS risk, overcome roadblocks to diagnosis and therapy, provide new insight into the pathogenesis of CM, and inform development of immunotherapy and vaccines. PUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungus that causes a devastating form of meningitis that occurs most commonly in HIV-infected patients with profound T cell deficiency, but also occurs in patients with organ transplants, on biologics, and people with no apparent immune deficiency. Although anti-retroviral therapy has reduced the risk of cryptococcal meningitis (CM) in resourced areas, CM continues to ravage HIV-infected patients in Africa, Asia and other areas, even with increased availability of anti-retroviral and anti-fungal therapy. The 6- month survival of CM in resource-limited settings is 45-55%. This is worse than glioblastoma multiforme (66% 2-year survival). At present, there is no way to identify patients who will develop cryptococcosis. The goal of this application is to identify a risk profile to help determine which patients are at risk for CM. This will have a significant impact on prevention, diagnosis, and care of patients with CM and be a major public and global health advance.","Antibodies, B cells and resistance to human

"Making antibody generation rapid, scalable, and democratic through machine learning and continuous evolution Project Summary/Abstract It is hard to overstate the importance of monoclonal antibodies in the life sciences. Antibodies are critical tools in biomedical research and diagnostics (e.g. western blotting, immunoprecipitation, cytometry, biomarker discovery, and histology), are one of the most rapidly growing class of therapeutics, and are the basis for myriad new strategies in cancer therapy, such as checkpoint inhibitors that are revolutionizing treatment. Unfortunately, current methods for the generation of custom antibodies, including animal immunization and phage display, are slow, costly, inaccessible to most researchers, and often unsuccessful. We propose Autonomously EvolvinG Yeast-displayed antibodieS (AEGYS), a system for the continuous and rapid evolution of high-quality antibodies against custom antigens that requires only the simple culturing of yeast cells. We believe this can be achieved by combining cutting-edge generative machine learning algorithms for antibody library design with a new technology for in vivo continuous evolution and a yeast antigen-presenting cell that we will engineer. If successful, AEGYS should have a transformative impact across the whole of biomedicine by turning monoclonal antibody generation into a rapid, scalable, and accessible process where any lab with standard molecular biology capabilities can generate custom antibodies on demand simply by “immunizing” a test tube of yeast cells with an antigen. We anticipate that this democratization of antibody generation will also result in an explosion of crowdsourced antibody sequence data that will train our machine learning algorithms to design better antibody libraries for AEGYS, starting a virtuous cycle. We ourselves will use AEGYS to generate a panel of subtype- and conformation-specific nanobodies against biogenic amine receptors including those that respond to acetylcholine, adrenaline, dopamine, and other neurotransmitters, so that we can understand their role in neurobiology and addiction.! Project Narrative This proposal will provide a system for the scalable continuous evolution and computational design of antibodies against user-selected antigens. Antibodies are critical tools in medical research and are the basis for numerous therapies, but the generation of custom antibodies against new targets is a difficult and specialized task. The system proposed will turn antibody generation into a routine and widely accessible process for researchers in almost any field.","Making antibody generation rapid, scalable, and democratic through machine learning and continuous evolution",10260452,R01CA260415,"['Acetylcholine ', ' Animals ', ' Antibodies ', ' Monoclonal Antibodies ', ' Clinical Treatment Moab ', ' mAbs ', ' Antibody Affinity ', ' antigen antibody affinity ', ' Antibody Formation ', ' Ab response ', ' Antibody Production ', ' antibody biosynthesis ', ' immunoglobulin biosynthesis ', ' Antigen-Presenting Cells ', ' accessory cell ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Western Blotting ', ' Western Immunoblotting ', ' protein blotting ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cultured Cells ', ' Chemistry ', ' Communities ', ' Detergents ', ' Dopamine ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Elements ', ' Engineering ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epinephrine ', ' Adrenaline ', ' Therapeutic Epinephrine ', ' Evolution ', ' Explosion ', ' Genes ', ' Histology ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybridomas ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Immunization ', ' Immunologic Sensitization ', ' Immunologic Stimulation ', ' Immunological Sensitization ', ' Immunological Stimulation ', ' Immunostimulation ', ' Immunoglobulin Fragments ', ' Antibody Fragments ', ' Immunoprecipitation ', ' Immune Precipitation ', ' Libraries ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurotransmitters ', ' Nerve Transmitter Substances ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Nobel Prize ', ' Pheromone ', ' Play ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Production ', ' Protein Engineering ', ' genetic protein engineering ', ' protein design ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Reagent ', ' Cell Surface Receptors ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Yeasts ', ' Generations ', ' Medical Research ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Custom ', ' Tube ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Biogenic Amine Receptors ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Directed Molecular Evolution ', ' directed evolution ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' scaffolding ', ' scaffold ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' empowered ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' structural biology ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' G Protein-Complex Receptor ', ' G Protein-Coupled Receptor Genes ', ' GPCR ', ' G-Protein-Coupled Receptors ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Proteome ', ' Cytometry ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer-directed therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' Neuraxis ', ' antigen bound ', ' antigen binding ', ' Affinity ', ' Data ', ' Therapeutic Studies ', ' Therapy Research ', ' in vivo ', ' Antigen Targeting ', ' Collection ', ' Phage Display ', ' Update ', ' V(D)J Recombination ', ' Immunoglobulin V(D)J Rearrangement ', ' V(D)J Rearrangement ', ' VDJ rearrangement ', ' VDJ recombination ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Docking ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' decision research ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Pathogen detection ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' antibody engineering ', ' nanobodies ', ' nanobody ', ' sdAb ', ' single domain antibodies ', ' crowdsourcing ', ' crowd source ', ' crowd-sourcing ', ' crowdsource ', ' biomarker discovery ', ' antibody libraries ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' Immune checkpoint inhibitor ', ' Checkpoint inhibitor ', ' immune check point inhibitor ', ' Immunize ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2021,1665161,CA-45
"Antibody repertoire characterization in the context of coronaviruses Project Summary. SARS-CoV-2, or the 2019 novel coronavirus, is a significant pandemic threat that has resulted in hundreds of thousands of diagnosed cases and tens of thousands of mortalities as of March 2020. The development of preventive and therapeutic measures that can counteract the ongoing, and any future, coronavirus pandemics is therefore of utmost significance for public health worldwide. The S protein is the immunodominant region of coronaviruses (CoV) recognized by the immune system and serves as the target for a number of neutralizing antibodies. Passive transfer of neutralizing antibodies has been shown to prevent coronavirus infection in animal models. Further, engineered prefusion-stabilized S protein immunogens have been shown to elicit high titers of coronavirus-neutralizing antibodies in animal models, in the context of MERS. Together, this prior work establishes a strong premise for targeting the identification and characterization of neutralizing antibodies in the context of SARS-CoV-2. More generally, a better understanding of the human antibody response to the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 as well as other related CoV members can help inform therapeutic antibody optimization and accelerate vaccine design efforts.  Our laboratory recently developed the LIBRA-seq technology (LInking B-cell Receptor to Antigen specificity through sequencing) for antibody discovery and characterization of antigen-specific antibody repertoires. Unlike other B cell approaches, LIBRA-seq is the first to enable the simultaneous determination of BCR sequence and antigen specificity for a large number of B cells against a theoretically unlimited number of diverse antigens, at the single-cell level. LIBRA-seq therefore provides a unique opportunity for characterizing the types and specificities of antibodies that can recognize the S protein from SARS-CoV-2, as well as other CoV viruses.  Here, we propose to utilize the LIBRA-seq technology in the context of SARS-CoV-2, with two major goals: (1) To identify cross-reactive antibodies that recognize multiple antigen variants associated with human coronavirus infection, including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and MERS-CoV, and (2) To evaluate the ability of current lead CoV vaccine candidates to engage with antibody repertoires from healthy individuals.  Taken together, the efforts proposed in this application will be of high potential translational/clinical impact for SARS-CoV-2 and other CoV pathogens of biomedical significance. The types of antibody repertoire characterization that we propose to develop here will also be readily generalizable to other pathogens, and as such, will have a broad and lasting impact on the development of countermeasures for established and emerging infectious diseases. Project Narrative  The development of preventive and therapeutic measures that can counteract the ongoing, and any future, coronavirus pandemics is of utmost significance for public health worldwide. Here, we propose to focus on the identification of coronavirus-specific antibodies as potential countermeasures against coronaviruses, by utilizing a powerful antibody discovery technology recently developed by our group.

"Machine learning-based development of serologic test for acute Lyme disease diagnosis Project Summary/Abstract Lyme Disease is a tickborne illness with markedly increasing prevalence in the United States and an urgent need for improved diagnostics in its early stages, when treatment is most efficient. While classic clinical presentation of the early illness is the presence of erythema migrans (EM), or “bullseye rash”, surrounding the tick bite site, 20-30% of patients do not present with EM. Further complicating diagnosis is a proportion of patients who present with EM, but are seronegative on the current standard two-tiered test algorithm (STTTA). The proposed research addresses the need for improved serological tests to diagnose early Lyme Disease in these patients, while the disease is the most responsive to treatment. A proof-of-concept antigen panel capable of distinguishing STTTA-positive acute Lyme samples from endemic controls was identified using a novel antigen discovery approach. This approach relies on representing an entire binding space of a donor’s circulating antibody repertoire using machine learning models based on the antibody binding profile to a diverse, random library of 126,050 peptides with an average length of 9 amino acids, which is a sparse representation of all possible amino acid combinations. Resulting models are then used to identify pathogen epitopes with high predictive power that are combined into a panel with diagnostic efficacy. Here, the unmet need of diagnosing early Lyme disease in STTTA-seronegative patients is addressed by the addition of antigens predicted as specific to this patient population. Diagnostic efficacy of the supplemented proof-of- concept antigen panel, that was identified in a previous proof-of-principle study, will be tested using an expanded cohort of STTTA seronegative donors and endemic controls. Specificity of the panel for Lyme disease will be confirmed using a panel of look-a-like illnesses including autoimmune diseases and tickborne diseases. This work is expected to yield data demonstrating the feasibility of a novel immunoassay for the diagnosis of early stage Lyme Disease patients currently missed by present tests. Additionally, it will serve as a demonstration of the antigen discovery approach as a means to identify diagnostic antigens for difficult pathogens. Project Narrative Improved diagnostics for early Lyme Disease, the most treatable stage of the disease, are urgently needed to identify infected patients, including those not presenting with the classic bullseye rash or who are seronegative on the standard two-tiered test algorithm. Here, we apply a novel antigen discovery approach that allows us to computationally model patients’ serum antibody binding profiles and predict diagnostic antigens for patients with early Lyme Disease. By developing a diagnostic assay which includes antigens specific for patients missed by current diagnostics, patient outcomes can be improved through enabling early intervention with effective treatments.",Machine learning-based development of serologic test for acute Lyme disease diagnosis,10259497,R43AI162473,"['Algorithms ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Antibodies ', ' Epitopes ', ' Antigenic Determinants ', ' Binding Determinants ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' Surface Antigens ', ' Cell Surface Antigens ', ' Immunologic Surface Markers ', ' Immunological Surface Markers ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune condition ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Borrelia burgdorferi ', ' B burgdorferi ', ' B. burgdorferi ', ' Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto ', ' Lyme Disease Spirochete ', ' lyme spirochete ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Differential Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Exanthema ', ' Exanthem ', ' Rash ', ' Skin Rash ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunoassay ', ' Incidence ', ' Laboratories ', ' Libraries ', ' Lyme Disease ', ' Lyme Borreliosis ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Peptides ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Protein Engineering ', ' genetic protein engineering ', ' protein design ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Serology test ', ' serology assay ', ' Specificity ', ' Synthetic Antigens ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' falls ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Immunology ', ' Custom ', ' Tick-Borne Diseases ', ' tick-borne illness ', ' tickborne disease ', ' tickborne illness ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Serology ', ' Ensure ', ' Chemicals ', ' Evaluation ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Test Result ', ' Services ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' synthetic peptide ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' technological innovation ', ' Proteome ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' cross reactivity ', ' diagnosis standard ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Antibody Repertoire ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' pathogen ', ' Prevalence ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' patient population ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' erythema migrans ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' seasonal influenza ', ' seasonal flu ', ' diagnostic assay ', ' biomarker panel ', ' marker panel ', ' molecular diagnostics ', ' clinical diagnostics ', ' classification algorithm ', ' tick-borne ', ' tickborne ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' in silico ', ' tick bite ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' antigen diagnostic ', ' antigen based diagnostics ', ' Autoimmune ', ' ']",NIAID,BIOMORPH TECHNOLOGIES LLC,R43,2021,300000,AZ-09
