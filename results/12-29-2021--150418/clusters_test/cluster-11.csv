"Exocytosis fuels plasma membrane expansion in developing neurons Project Summary During development, neurons acquire a polarized, elongated, and complex morphology, which requires a significant expansion of plasma membrane surface area. Surface increases have been estimated to reach upward of 20% per day, which far exceeds concomitant neuronal volume increases. We previously demonstrated that SNARE-mediated exocytosis is required during neuritogenesis and axon branching, presumably to provide membrane material to the expanding plasma membrane, which can only stretch ~2-3% prior to rupture. Asymmetric exocytosis has also been implicated in the attractive axonal turning responses that are critical for axon guidance. Achieving proper neuronal morphogenesis and connectivity is central to the formation of a functional nervous system. Together these factors underscore the significance of regulated exocytosis in developing neurons, even prior to synaptogenesis. Over the last 40 years, a multitude of components involved in exocytosis have been identified, although this list is not exhaustive. Further, mechanisms that regulate the mode, progression, frequency, or spatiotemporal organization of vesicle fusion with the membrane, all of which are poised to modulate neuronal morphogenesis, have not been defined. To visualize exocytic events in developing neurons, we express a pH-sensitive variant of GFP (pHluorin) attached to the lumenal side of a v-SNARE, such as VAMP2 or VAMP7, to illuminate the occurrence of fusion pore opening between the acidic vesicular lumen and the neutral extracellular space. Analysis of such images has remained a time-intensive, non-automated bottleneck, delaying understanding of this fundamental cellular behavior. We developed a fully-automated computer- vision software for the detection and analysis of VAMP-pHluorin mediated exocytic events that will quantitatively reveal the spatial and temporal organization and regulation of exocytosis in developing neurons at a level of detail previously unattainable. We exploit this innovative methodology along with unbiased proteomics, microfluidics, biochemical and cell biological approaches to investigate the relationship between exocytosis and neuronal morphogenesis and identifying the molecular mechanisms that regulate exocytosis in developing neurons. PROJECT NARRATIVE During development, neurons acquire a highly elongated, polarized and complex cell shape that requires a dramatic expansion of the neuronal surface area or plasma membrane, which is hypothesized to be fueled by vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. We will define mechanisms that regulate the mode, progression, frequency, and organization of vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane of developing neurons, all of which are poised to modulate neuronal cell shape.",Exocytosis fuels plasma membrane expansion in developing neurons,10159320,R01NS112326,"['Affect ', ' Axon ', ' Cell membrane ', ' Cytoplasmic Membrane ', ' Plasma Membrane ', ' plasmalemma ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clathrin ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Diffusion ', ' Endocytosis ', ' Exocytosis ', ' Extracellular Space ', ' Intercellular Space ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' In Vitro ', ' Methodology ', ' Morphogenesis ', ' morphogenetic process ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Phosphorylation ', ' Protein Phosphorylation ', ' Protein Tyrosine Kinase ', ' EPH- and ELK-Related Tyrosine Kinase ', ' EPH-and ELK-Related Kinase ', ' Ephrin Type-A Receptor 8 ', ' Ephrin Type-A Receptor 8 Precursor ', ' Protein Tyrosine Kinase EEK ', ' Tyrosine Kinase ', ' Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Receptor EEK ', ' Tyrosine-Specific Protein Kinase ', ' Tyrosylprotein Kinase ', ' hydroxyaryl protein kinase ', ' tyrosyl protein kinase ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Tetanus ', ' clostridial tetanus ', ' Time ', ' Neurites ', ' Mediating ', ' Cell Shape ', ' Lateral ', ' Distal ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' NSF attachment protein receptor ', ' SNARE ', ' soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive-factor attachment protein receptor ', ' SNAP receptor ', ' Morphology ', ' Vesicle ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Side ', ' Techniques ', ' Growth Cones ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' synapse formation ', ' synaptogenesis ', ' physical model ', ' Stretching ', ' novel ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Proteomics ', ' PHluorin ', ' axon growth cone guidance ', ' axon guidance ', ' Regulation of Exocytosis ', ' µfluidic ', ' Microfluidics ', ' FADK ', ' FAK ', ' FAK1 ', ' PTK2 ', ' pp125FAK ', ' PTK2 gene ', ' v-SNAREs ', ' vesicule SNARE proteins ', ' vesicular SNARE proteins ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' in vivo ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Total Internal Reflection Fluorescent ', ' TIRF Microscopy ', ' Total Internal Reflection Fluorescent Microscopy ', ' Rupture ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' cell behavior ', ' cellular behavior ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,384007,NC-04
"Impaired spatial decoding and neural population code rescaling in AD mice Impaired spatial decoding and neural population code rescaling in AD mice Project Summary: Considerable evidence exists to support the notion that amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau pathology impair neuronal circuit integrity and function in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Unfortunately, few studies have tested the direct influence of AD pathology on spatial computation within affected neuronal populations, resulting in an information gap at the neuronal network level. Moreover, in vivo experiments that examine large scale, neuronal network activity in mouse models of Aβ and tau pathology are lacking. In this proposal, I test the overarching hypothesis that Aβ and tau associated neuronal network dysfunction impairs task-relevant, spatial information encoding in large populations of neurons within the EC-HIPP circuit, and that combating this aberrant activity can restore order and improve spatial information processing in AD mice. In Aim 1, I will test the hypothesis that oligomeric forms of Aβ and tau disturb spatial information content encoded within large populations of neurons in the entorhinal cortex – hippocampal (EC-HIPP) circuit. I will also test if these oligomeric peptides alter the number of neurons recruited into the population code responsible for memory encoding in a spatial learning and memory task. In Aims 2 & 3, I will leverage the predictive power of machine learning to decipher the neural code for spatial information processing in EC-HIPP population activity. Specifically, my goals in Aim 2 will be to examine the individual and combined impact of Aβ and tau pathologies on features of spatial information encoding in the EC-Tau/hAPP mouse line. In Aim 3, I will employ chemogenetics using a novel DREADDs ligand to combat aberrant neuronal activity in AD mouse models, with the ultimate goal of improving spatial information processing in neuronal networks burdened with pathology. Excitatory neurons will be specifically targeted in an effort to better understand their contribution to impaired spatial information processing in AD mouse models.  The proposed research aims are designed to bridge an information gap between AD-related cognitive impairment and the underlying circuit pathology. This Mentored Research Scientist Development (K01) Award will afford me the opportunity to accomplish this major goal while enriching my technical skillset and expanding my knowledge of AD pathophysiology. In addition, the integrated training and mentorship that I will receive will help me develop additional expertise in machine learning for spatial decoding analyses. Together, the proposed studies and career development plan will ensure that I achieve my long-term career goal of launching a competitive, independent research career at a major research university. Project Narrative The progressive accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau pathology in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is associated with dysfunctional neuronal signaling and poor cognitive performance. In this proposal, newly developed machine learning strategies will be used to decode features of task-relevant, spatial information from neural ensemble activity in the entorhinal cortex – hippocampal (EC-HIPP) circuit of transgenic mice expressing Aβ and tau pathology, with the overarching goal of understanding how Aβ and tau interfere with spatial information encoded within neuronal networks. Dysfunctional neuronal populations will then be selectively targeted using chemogenetics to correct their aberrant firing patterns, with the aim of improving the quality of spatial information carried by pathology afflicted neuronal networks.",Impaired spatial decoding and neural population code rescaling in AD mice,10237353,K01AG068598,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's

"Deciphering the building blocks of hippocampal circuits   Abstract   Since  Ramon  y  Cajal,  neuroscientists  have  speculated  that  even  the  most  complex  brain  functions  might  eventually be understood at the level of neuronal cell types and their connections. Unfortunately, our under‐ standing of the brain's extensive diversity of cell types and elaborate circuitry remains far from complete. For  example, despite the hippocampus being essential for learning and memory and its dysfunction underlying a  wide variety of devastating neuropsychiatric disorders, we still lack fundamental knowledge about its constit‐ uent cell types and their molecular profiles and connectivity, slowing progress towards a mechanistic circuit‐ level understanding of memory formation. We propose to identify all of the interneuron cell types in area CA1  of the hippocampus and decipher their canonical connectivity. We have assembled a strong interdisciplinary  team  capable  of  combining  cutting‐edge  technologies  including  high‐throughput  multi‐cell  patch  recordings,  morphological reconstructions, single‐cell RNA sequencing, and machine learning to achieve two main goals:  1) dissect CA1 microcircuit organization by generating a morphological and electrophysiological taxonomy of  all interneuron cell types in mouse CA1 and map their connections; and 2) derive transcriptomic signatures of  morphologically defined CA1 interneurons using our newly developed Patch‐seq method. Our team recently  implemented  this  interdisciplinary  experimental  strategy  to  successfully  identify  cell  types  in  the  neocortex  and dissect their microcircuitry. Using multi‐cell patch clamp recording, we will characterize the electrophysi‐ ological properties, morphology, laminar location and connectivity of thousands of neurons from mouse CA1  hippocampus. We will also utilize a new, highly sensitive, cost effective technique for single‐cell RNA sequenc‐ ing (Smart‐seq2) to map their transcriptomes and machine learning techniques to classify cells into molecular  types.  Importantly,  our  high‐throughput  method  will  allow  us  to  obtain  morphological,  electrophysiological  and  complete  transcriptome  information  for  single  neurons,  which  cannot  be  achieved  using  other  methods  such as dissociating tissue for single‐cell sequencing. In‐house customization and automation has reduced our  sequencing costs, enabling us to sequence thousands of cells within a reasonable budget. Cell type identifica‐ tion will be validated using morphological, electrophysiological, and molecular tests. Identifying all of the in‐ terneuron  cell  types  that  comprise  CA1  and  determining  how  they  connect  to  each  other  will  have  a  broad,  paradigm‐shifting impact. For instance, it will contribute to a circuit‐level understanding of the computations  that take place in CA1, such as memory formation. From a clinical perspective, single‐cell transcriptome data  will yield a powerful atlas to investigate relationships between cell types and genes related to neuropsychiatric  diseases and facilitate cell‐type engineering.       Narrative  The  hippocampus  is  a  complex  brain  structure  that  mediates  remarkable  mental  functions  like  learning  and  memory, while its malfunction is associated with devastating neuropsychiatric diseases including Alzheimer's  disease, schizophrenia, depression, and temporal lobe epilepsy. For more than a century, neuroscientists have  marveled  at  the  extensive  diversity  of  neuronal  cell  types  that  comprise  the  hippocampus  and  other  brain  structures,  yet  we  still  know  very  little  about  their  identity  and  how  they  are  wired  together  to  mediate  information processing in the brain. We propose a novel research approach that will enable us to identify the  different  interneuron  cell  types  in  the  CA1  region  of  the  hippocampus  and  determine  their  connectivity  diagram,  which  will  lead  to  a  better  circuit‐level  understanding  of  hippocampal  function  and  more  effective

"CRCNS: Inferring reference points from OFC population dynamics A key computation that all mammals perform is determining the value of different outcomes. People and animal models evaluate outcomes as gains or losses relative to an internal reference point, likely  reflecting their experience-based expectations. For example, if someone is told they will receive a particular salary at a new job, but when they start, they find that the salary is substantially less, they will view that salary (which is a net increase in wealth) as a loss relative to their reference point. Reference  dependence is a consequential, ubiquitous phenomenon, driving decisions about insurance, financial products, labor, and retirement savings. The proposed work seeks to uncover how large populations of neurons represent a cognitive variable –the reference point- during value-based decision-making. This work involves complementary, synergistic interactions between experimentalists and theorists in the labs  of Dr. Christine Constantinople and Dr. Cristina Savin, respectively.  This proposal will develop a novel behavioral paradigm for studying reference dependence in rats, enabling application of powerful tools to monitor large-scale neural dynamics. High-throughput behavioral training will generate dozens of trained subjects for experiments in parallel. We will also develop a  behavioral model to quantify key aspects of rats' behavior, including individual differences in behavior across animals (Aim 1). We will use new silicon probes with high channel counts (“Neuropixels” probes) to record from populations of neurons in dozens of rats during behavior. Recordings will be obtained from  the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), a key brain structure implicated in value-based decision-making. We will develop novel latent dynamics models that will infer the reference point directly from populations of simultaneously recorded neurons in OFC, without any knowledge of the task or rats' behavior. This model will also be able to identify aspects of neural dynamics that are common across dozens of rats, and  aspects that are variable across animals, reflecting individual differences in behavior (Aim 2). Finally, we  will use complementary, state-of-the-art machine-learning techniques to train recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on our behavioral and neural data. This approach will generate concrete hypotheses about the  neural circuit architectures performing reference-dependent subjective valuation in our task (Aim 3). Decision-making is disrupted in psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia & bipolar disorder.Moreover,  all major classes of psychiatric disorders are associated with disordered reward processing in the brain.  Therefore, a circuit-level understanding of how the brain computes and represents the reference point  during value-based decision-making has enormous consequences for human health, and may hold  promise for improving treatments for mental health disorders in which decision-making is impaired.",CRCNS: Inferring reference points from OFC population dynamics,10261540,R01MH125571,"['Affect ', ' Animals ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' Birds ', ' Aves ', ' Avian ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Capuchin Monkey ', ' Cebus ', ' Ring-Tail Monkey ', ' capuchin ', ' Choice Behavior ', ' Decision Making ', ' Decision Theory ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Insurance ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Modernization ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Population Dynamics ', ' Rattus ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rat ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Retirement ', ' Rewards ', ' Wages ', ' Salaries ', ' Savings ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Silicon ', ' Si element ', ' Testing ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Consequentialism ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' Behavioral Paradigm ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Impairment ', ' Implant ', ' reward processing ', ' behavioral economics ', ' dynamic system ', ' dynamical system ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' preservation ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' ']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,337222,NY-12
"Scalable tools for consistent identification of neuronal cell types in mouse and human Project Summary The proposed work will address a critical gap in our understanding of neuronal phenotypes and cell types by developing machine learning algorithms and cloud-based software for the integration of multiple modality characterizations large and growing datasets of cortical neurons in mouse and human. Through optimal and innovative use of potentially incomplete data and emphasis on automated morphological characterization, the proposed tools will enable richer and consistent characterizations of neurons from transcriptomic, anatomical, or electrophysiological profiling. While large-scale, BICCN-funded cell type research programs rely on the notion of unique neuronal identity which determines the cell’s phenotype across different observation modalities, overarching agreements across physiological, anatomical and molecular characterizations remain elusive. Although these large-scale programs succeeded in generating extensive multiple modality datasets, the lack of principled, accurate and widely available computational alignment and inference tools presents a roadblock to the success of the overall program. A second issue is that anatomical characterization, despite being the classical approach to understanding cell types, lags significantly behind molecular and physiological methods in terms of throughput. The research proposed here aims to address the alignment problem by building on the coupled autoencoder approach, which presents an efficient optimization framework centered on the ubiquity of neuronal identity. Importantly, the proposed software can utilize incompletely characterized data points, which is common in practice, to produce unified visualization and analysis of abstract neuronal identity. This tool will be both flexible (e.g., the feature set can be changed) and extensible (e.g., more observation modalities can be added for joint alignment). The aligned representations enable consistent clustering of the neuronal population across the different observation modalities, which is a pressing problem in modern neuroscience. We propose to address the anatomical throughput issue with an end-to-end computational pipeline, from the raw image of local neuronal arbors to the anatomical descriptor that can be readily aligned and interpreted by the coupled autoencoder software. By utilizing our extensive gold-standard manual reconstructions, we will train supervised deep artificial neural networks to segment neuronal arbors in sparse labeling scenarios. The rich set of training examples, together with algorithmic innovations, will endow superior generalizability of this automated segmentation tool, accelerating science for light microscopy-based studies. Project Narrative The prospect of addressing many questions on the function and dysfunction of the nervous system hinges on the ability to consistently identify the same cell type label for a given cell, independent of the observation modality. While much recent progress has been achieved by jointly characterizing neurons with multiple observation modalities, a lack of software tools that can consistently infer the type and unobserved features of incompletely characterized neurons hinders progress. This work will analyze large and growing single neuron datasets to develop accessible computational methods for relating and harmonizing anatomical, electrophysiological and molecular data.",Scalable tools for consistent identification of neuronal cell types in mouse and human,10365216,RF1MH128778,"['Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Axon ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Gold ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutes ', ' Joints ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Phenotype ', ' Quality Control ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Science ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Translating ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Acute ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Descriptor ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' light microscopy ', ' cell type ', ' Location ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Speed ', ' Agreement ', ' Modality ', ' Property ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Brightfield Analysis ', ' Brightfield Microscopy ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' molecular profile ', ' molecular signature ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Collection ', ' Slice ', ' Preparation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' reconstruction ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' transcriptomics ', ' image archival system ', ' Image data archive ', ' image archive ', ' image library ', ' image repository ', ' imaging repository ', ' picture archive ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' cloud based ', ' microscopic imaging ', ' microscope imaging ', ' microscopy imaging ', ' brain dysfunction ', ' dysfunctional brain ', ' cloud platform ', ' cloud server ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' artificial neural network ', ' artificial neural net ', ' computational neural network ', ' synthetic neural network ', ' neural network ', ' autoencoder ', ' autoencoding neural network ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' automated analysis ', ' Visualization ', ' multiple datasets ', ' multiple data sets ', ' computational pipelines ', ' automated segmentation ', ' auto-segmentation ', ' automatic segmentation ', ' autosegmentation ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' patch sequencing ', ' patch-seq ', ' patchseq ', ' data repository ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' ']",NIMH,ALLEN INSTITUTE,RF1,2021,1081350,WA-07

Together these factors underscore the significance of regulated exocytosis in developing neurons, even prior to synaptogenesis. Over the last 40 years, a multitude of components involved in exocytosis have been identified, although this list is not exhaustive. Further, mechanisms that regulate the mode, progression, frequency, or spatiotemporal organization of vesicle fusion with the membrane, all of which are poised to modulate neuronal morphogenesis, have not been defined. To visualize exocytic events in developing neurons, we express a pH-sensitive variant of GFP (pHluorin) attached to the lumenal side of a v-SNARE, such as VAMP2 or VAMP7, to illuminate the occurrence of fusion pore opening between the acidic vesicular lumen and the neutral extracellular space. Analysis of such images has remained a time-intensive, non-automated bottleneck, delaying understanding of this fundamental cellular behavior. We developed a fully-automated computer- vision software for the detection and analysis of VAMP-pHluorin mediated exocytic events that will quantitatively reveal the spatial and temporal organization and regulation of exocytosis in developing neurons at a level of detail previously unattainable. We exploit this innovative methodology along with unbiased proteomics, microfluidics, biochemical and cell biological approaches to investigate the relationship between exocytosis and neuronal morphogenesis and identifying the molecular mechanisms that regulate exocytosis in developing neurons. PROJECT NARRATIVE During development, neurons acquire a highly elongated, polarized and complex cell shape that requires a dramatic expansion of the neuronal surface area or plasma membrane, which is hypothesized to be fueled by vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. We will define mechanisms that regulate the mode, progression, frequency, and organization of vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane of developing neurons, all of which are poised to modulate neuronal cell shape.",Exocytosis fuels plasma membrane expansion in developing neurons,10488994,R01NS112326,"['Affect ', ' Axon ', ' Cell membrane ', ' Cytoplasmic Membrane ', ' Plasma Membrane ', ' plasmalemma ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clathrin ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Diffusion ', ' Endocytosis ', ' Exocytosis ', ' Extracellular Space ', ' Intercellular Space ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' In Vitro ', ' Methodology ', ' Morphogenesis ', ' morphogenetic process ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Phosphorylation ', ' Protein Phosphorylation ', ' Protein Tyrosine Kinase ', ' EPH- and ELK-Related Tyrosine Kinase ', ' EPH-and ELK-Related Kinase ', ' Ephrin Type-A Receptor 8 ', ' Ephrin Type-A Receptor 8 Precursor ', ' Protein Tyrosine Kinase EEK ', ' Tyrosine Kinase ', ' Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Receptor EEK ', ' Tyrosine-Specific Protein Kinase ', ' Tyrosylprotein Kinase ', ' hydroxyaryl protein kinase ', ' tyrosyl protein kinase ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Tetanus ', ' clostridial tetanus ', ' Time ', ' Neurites ', ' Mediating ', ' Cell Shape ', ' Lateral ', ' Distal ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' NSF attachment protein receptor ', ' SNARE ', ' soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive-factor attachment protein receptor ', ' SNAP receptor ', ' Morphology ', ' Vesicle ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Side ', ' Techniques ', ' Growth Cones ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' synapse formation ', ' synaptogenesis ', ' physical model ', ' Stretching ', ' novel ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Proteomics ', ' PHluorin ', ' axon growth cone guidance ', ' axon guidance ', ' Regulation of Exocytosis ', ' µfluidic ', ' Microfluidics ', ' FADK ', ' FAK ', ' FAK1 ', ' PTK2 ', ' pp125FAK ', ' PTK2 gene ', ' v-SNAREs ', ' vesicule SNARE proteins ', ' vesicular SNARE proteins ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' in vivo ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Total Internal Reflection Fluorescent ', ' TIRF Microscopy ', ' Total Internal Reflection Fluorescent Microscopy ', ' Rupture ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' cell behavior ', ' cellular behavior ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,214085,NC-04
"Decoding the neural mechanism underlying variable action selection in Drosophila. Project Summary/Abstract There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how complex, multi-action, behavioral variability is generated by neural circuits in the brain. Understanding this process is crucial to understanding how many neurological diseases cause restricted and inappropriate selection of actions. The goal of this proposal is to understand how populations of neurons control the behavioral variability in action selection for complex behaviors. We will utilize the fruit fly to investigate this question because despite having a much simpler brain than humans, the fruit fly performs complex behaviors with high variability. We have found that activating just 24 neurons in the fruit fly brain causes variable expression of four distinct aggressive actions: stopping, wing elevation, leg extension, and lunging. The relative simplicity of this system is ideal for pin-pointing the contribution of different sources of variability: cell-autonomous stochasticity in action potential generation, variability at a network-level or variability in muscles or other neurons affected by the 24 neurons. To test these sources for variability, the project will consist of three main aims. The first is to determine whether the actions are discrete states of behavior or lie within a continuum by using advances in machine learning and neuroethology to automate the identification of the aggressive behavioral actions and the transitions between these actions. The second is to test the hypothesis that each action is caused by neurons with similar neuroanatomical connections using neuroimaging, genetic manipulation, and controlled behavioral experiments. The third is to use functional imaging, in vivo electrophysiological recordings, and computational modeling to determine the neural basis for the variability of behavior. By combining theory, experimentation, and modeling, we will be able to provide a systems level explanation of the logic behind why animals perform different actions despite consistent levels of neuronal activation. Project Narrative The ability to flexibly and appropriately perform action selection is altered in many neurological and psychiatric diseases. However, the mechanism behind the variability in action selection while performing complex behaviors is not understood. By quantifying, modeling, and decoding the neural logic behind the variability in action selection of a fruit fly, we aim to build new theories about how our own brain works and provide insight into better treatment of diseases affecting proper execution of behaviors.",Decoding the neural mechanism underlying variable action selection in Drosophila.,10269928,F31NS120835,"['Action Potentials ', ' Affect ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drosophila genus ', ' Drosophila ', ' fruit fly ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Goals ', ' Horns ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Logic ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Probability ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Video Recording ', ' Videorecording ', ' video recording system ', ' Wing ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' genetic manipulation ', ' gene manipulation ', ' genetically manipulate ', ' genetically perturb ', ' Lateral ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavior Control ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' appendage ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' sensory integration ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' patch clamp ', ' Leg ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' in vivo ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' fly ', ' Flies ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' markov model ', ' Population ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' optogenetics ', ' in vivo imaging ', ' imaging in vivo ', ' neuroethology ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' peanut butter ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NINDS,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,46036,PA-03
"Regulation of social aggression through hippocampal CA2 inputs to lateral septum Heightened levels of social aggression, a motivated behavior, are often associated with neuropsychiatric disease. Although our understanding of the neural mechanisms regulating aggression is incomplete, both lateral septum (LS) and ventral hypothalamus are known to be important. Even though LS receives one of its strongest inputs from hippocampus, a region important for declarative memory, little is known about how hippocampus regulates aggression. Moreover, as hippocampus is implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders associated with altered social behavior and aggression, a basic understanding of how hippocampus and its circuitry regulate aggression will likely yield important new insights into disease mechanisms.  Here we focus on the role of the hippocampal CA2 region in social aggression. Relatively little is known about CA2, largely because of technical problems that limit its study with conventional lesioning approaches. We therefore developed a Cre mouse line that enables us to label and manipulate the activity of CA2 pyramidal neurons. Using a genetic silencing approach, we found that CA2 was critical during non-aggressive social exploration for the formation of social memory, the ability of an animal to recognize and remember another mouse (conspecific), but CA2 was not needed for other forms of hippocampal memory. Our recent results now show that CA2 also promotes social aggression, through an excitatory projection to LS that disinhibits a subnucleus in ventral medial hypothalamus important for aggression. Moreover, we find that the social neuropeptide arginine vasopressin promotes aggression by enhancing the CA2 to LS synapse.  Here we ask: How does a single brain region, CA2, participate in social memory storage during non- aggressive social exploration and promote social aggression? Is there a single population of CA2 neurons that is activated during both social exploration and social aggression? Or are there specialist neurons for each behavior? Does CA2 actively encode distinct representations of social exploration and social aggression, or does CA2 encode a single social salience signal that does not in itself encode aggression but that is gated by the internal state of an animal to promote aggression through CA2 inputs to LS? We will test the hypothesis that vasopressin release in LS acts as such a permissive gate. As vasopressin also enhances social memory by acting within CA2, we will ask: How can a single neuromodulator produce two such distinct actions? Do distinct sources of vasopressin input to CA2 and LS promote, respectively, social memory and aggression?  We will address these questions by characterizing CA2 circuits and neural activity during aggressive and non-aggressive social interactions using: 1. Activity-dependent genetic marking of active CA2 ensembles; 2. Electrophysiological characterization of CA2?LS circuits and their regulation by vasopressin in ex vivo brain slices; 3. Behavioral control of aggression using chemogenetics and optogenetics; and 4. In vivo optical and electrophysiological recordings of CA2 activity during non-aggressive and aggressive social interactions. Many neuropsychiatric disorders are associated with increased levels of aggression, which impair patient care and place a burden on society. Here we will examine the neural mechanisms by which the CA2 region of the hippocampus, a relatively unexplored brain region implicated in social memory and schizophrenia, regulates aggressive behavior in mice.",Regulation of social aggression through hippocampal CA2 inputs to lateral septum,10226105,R01MH120292,"['Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Animals ', ' Argipressin ', ' Arginine Vasopressin ', ' Vasopressin-Neurophysin II-Copeptin ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hypothalamic structure ', ' Hypothalamus ', ' hypothalamic ', ' Middle Hypothalamus ', ' Intermediate Hypothalamic Region ', ' Medial Hypothalamus ', ' Locales ', ' male ', ' Memory ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neuropeptides ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Play ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Societies ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Vasopressins ', ' Antidiuretic Hormone ', ' beta-Hypophamine ', ' Mediating ', ' Specialist ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Lateral ', ' Dorsal ', ' Presynaptic Terminals ', ' Axon Terminals ', ' Presynaptic Nerve Endings ', ' Synaptic Boutons ', ' Synaptic Terminals ', ' Immediate-Early Genes ', ' Lesion ', ' insight ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavior Control ', ' Source ', ' extracellular ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Regulation ', ' Neuromodulator ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' in vivo ', ' Slice ', ' Monitor ', ' Output ', ' hippocampal pyramidal neuron ', ' Pyramidal neuron ', ' motivated behavior ', ' maternal aggression ', ' Population ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Impairment ', ' presynaptic ', ' selective expression ', ' selectively expressed ', ' optogenetics ', ' anatomical tracing ', ' anatomical tracer ', ' anatomical tract tracer ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,462162,NY-13
"Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale Project Summary This project aims to leverage the best of both computational and human expertise in neuronal reconstruction towards the goal of accelerating global neuroscience discovery from internationally-sourced imaging data. We propose to create a cloud-based unified platform for converging 3-dimensional images of neurons onto a single analysis platform to (1) train and grow a new expert community of global reconstructors to work across the data from these groups, to (2) generate a community-sourced neuronal reconstruction database of open imaging data that can be incorporated into a 3-dimensional map of neuronal interconnectivity - onto which (3) novel annotations and more complex functional and molecular data can be overlaid. Our approach will evolve with the growing needs of the neuroscience community over time. To do this, in Aim One (Neuronal Reconstruction at Scale), we will test if the newly developed crowd-sourced game-based platform Mozak can develop a collective of new human experts at scale, capable of accelerating the rate of current reconstruction by at least an order of magnitude, at the same time as increasing the robustness, quality and unbiasedness of the final reconstructions. In Aim Two (Robust Multi-Purpose Annotation), we will enhance basic neuronal reconstruction by adding specific semantic annotation— including soma volume and morphological quantification, volumetric analysis, and ongoing features (e.g. dendritic spines, axonal varicosities) requested from the neuroscience community. Experienced and high-ranking members will be given the opportunity to advance through increasingly complex neurons into full arbor brain-wide neuronal projections and multiple clustered groups of neurons in localized circuits. Finally, in Aim 3 (Creation of a Research-Adaptive Data Repository), we aim to develop a database of neuronal images reconstructed using the Mozak interface that will directly serve the general and specific needs of different research groups. Our goal is to make this database dynamically adaptive — as new research questions will invariably bring new needs for additional annotations and cross-referencing with other data modalities. This highquality unbiased processing repository will also be perfectly suited for training sets for automated algorithms, and the generation of a 3-dimensional maps such as Allen Institute for Brain Science (AIBS) common coordinate framework. We expect that the computational reconstruction methods will further improve with the new large corpus of “gold standard” reconstructions. Collectively, the completion of these three aims will create an analysis suite as well as an online community of experts capable of performing in depth analysis of large-scale datasets that will significantly accelerate neuroscience research, enhance machine learning for reconstruction analysis, and create a common platform of baseline neuronal morphology data against which aberrantly functioning neurons can be analyzed. Project Narrative  This project will create a new central nexus point for neuronal reconstruction and semantic annotation (Mozak) that can be used by all research labs via an accessible online portal. We will develop a new cadre of neuronal reconstruction experts that will— in conjunction with automated tools that are enhanced by their work — drastically increase the volume, quality and robustness of neuron reconstructions and annotations. Mozak reconstructions will be shared with existing repositories and will be continually updated and re-annotated based on emerging needs of research - ensuring perpetual relevance, and allowing us to generate a platform to establish the range of “baseline” 3-dimensional readouts of neuronal morphology against which diseased or malfunctioning neurons can be analyzed and understood. 1",Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale,10204729,R01MH116247,"['Algorithms ', ' Axon ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Research ', ' Science ', ' Semantics ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Varicosity ', ' Varices ', ' Varicose Veins ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Gap Junctions ', ' Communicating Junction ', ' Low-resistance Junction ', ' Nexus ', ' Nexus Junction ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' experience ', ' neural cell body ', ' soma ', ' neuronal cell body ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Modality ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' dendrite spine ', ' Dendritic Spines ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Slice ', ' Update ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' reconstruction ', ' Three-dimensional analysis ', ' 3-D analysis ', ' 3-dimensional analysis ', ' 3D analysis ', ' Outcome ', ' Imaging technology ', ' two-dimensional ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' cloud based ', ' citizen science ', ' amateur science ', ' amateur scientists ', ' citizen scientists ', ' civic science ', ' crowd science ', ' crowd-sourced science ', ' scientific citizenship ', ' crowdsourcing ', ' crowd source ', ' crowd-sourcing ', ' crowdsource ', ' online community ', ' on-line community ', ' virtual community ', ' web portal ', ' internet portal ', ' on-line portal ', ' online portal ', ' web-based portal ', ' petabyte ', ' Infrastructure ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' automated algorithm ', ' automatic algorithm ', ' data repository ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,639861,WA-07
"Dopamine circuit regulation of morphine reinforcement across the opioid exposure cycle PROJECT SUMMARY Pathological adaptions in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine system associated with chronic exposure to opioids and opioid withdrawal can dysregulate responsivity to opioids and contextual cue associations. The primary goal of this training proposal is to gain new skills in advanced computational techniques to delineate how functionally diverse subpopulations of VTA dopamine neurons are regulated during morphine exposure and the formation of morphine contextual associations in non-dependent and morphine-dependent mice. Foundational findings have identified the intrinsic and synaptic (glutamatergic and GABAergic) adaptations that VTA dopamine neurons undergo throughout acute and chronic opioid exposure. Yet, few studies have accounted for the functional diversity of VTA dopamine neurons that mediate distinct aspects of cue-reward processing and motivation. Dissociating the potential diversity of VTA dopamine responses in the development of opioid dependence will help unravel the neural basis of the progression of opioid-use disorder. The Zweifel lab has previously used a genetic approach to isolate functionally distinct subpopulations of dopamine neurons that project to discrete regions of the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Corticotrophin releasing hormone receptor 1 (Crhr1)-Cre VTA dopamine neurons were found to selectively project to the NAc Core (VTACore) and cholecystokinin (Cck)-Cre VTA dopamine neurons selectively project to the NAc medial Shell (VTAmShell). I hypothesize that there exist projection-specific neural and behavioral correlates in response to morphine and during the formation of morphine contextual associations in non-dependent and morphine-dependent mice. I will investigate this using a systematic approach across three aims. For Aim 1 (K99), I will use behavioral pharmacology and fiber photometry to determine whether VTACore and VTAmShell dopamine neurons engage in uniform or differential dose-dependent neural activation dynamics in non-dependent and morphine dependent mice. For Aim 2 (K99), I will use my skills in conditioned place preference and in vivo fiber photometry to determine how the VTACore and VTAmShell neurons encode contextual associations to morphine in non-dependent and morphine dependent mice. For Aim 3 (R00), I will determine the basis of these pathological adaptations in VTA dopamine subpopulations by dissecting the role mu-opioid receptor (MOR)- sensitive GABAergic inputs play in morphine contextual associations. During the K99 mentored phase, I will gain new scientific training in Dr. Larry Zweifel’s laboratory, augmented by my advisory committee, in computational analytical tools to analyze complex neurophysiological and behavioral data sets. I will also gain new career development training from Dr. Zweifel, my advisory committee, and the MOSAIC UE5 program that will facilitate my transition into a successful independent principal investigator in academia. Importantly, I will continue my work on increasing representation and equity in the biomedical research workforce. PROJECT NARRATIVE The opioid crisis has inflicted a tremendous socioeconomic burden and resulted in the countless loss of lives. In order to further initiatives geared towards resolving the opioid crisis with novel treatments, basic neurophysiological mechanisms that underlie pathological opioid behaviors need to be elucidated.

"Spatially Resolved Dynamics of Molecular Pathology and Intercellular Interactions in Amytrophic Lateral Sclerosis Project Abstract Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating progressive neurodegenerative disease in which the loss of upper (primary motor cortex, M1) and lower (spinal cord, SC) motor neurons (MNs) ultimately leads to total paralysis. MN loss in ALS involves cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous activities in multiple cell types of the M1 and SC, the organization of which are well understood. However, there remain 4 major gaps in our knowledge: 1) How ALS-associated molecular pathology in the various cell types of the M1 relates to those in the SC; 2) How subpopulations of specific cell types are spatially arranged in these two regions; 3) How subpopulations of different cell types are organized in higher-order ensembles; and 4) How the coordinated behavior of these ensembles relates to disease-associated molecular pathology (e.g., pathognomonic inclusions). Towards addressing these questions, we propose to develop a spatially resolved multi-omics catalog of cellular subpopulations in the M1 and SC of patients with ALS and healthy controls. By using a combination of approaches to simultaneously map the spatial transcriptome and proteome of all interacting cellular subpopulations in these regions, our aim is to elucidate the origins and temporal dynamics of inter- and intra-cellular activities that may reveal novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets for ALS. Our overarching hypothesis is that ALS pathology stems from dysfunctional MN-glial interactions, and that this predictably differs in the M1 and SC in accordance with patient symptomatology. To address this hypothesis, we propose to use spatially resolved transcriptomic and proteomic measurements to study intact human postmortem tissue from patients stratified by clinical presentation (i.e., site of initial symptom presentation, bulbar or lower limb). We have previously implemented Spatial Transcriptomics on mouse and human SC to identify regional differences within subpopulations of various cell types that vary as a function of disease dynamics. Here, we propose to build upon our existing human study, and for the first time, develop a spatially resolved multi-omics dataset at scale and in the context of disease in matched human postmortem M1 and SC samples (Aim 1), to enable simultaneous exploration of upper and lower motor neurons in the context of intact tissue. These data will be directly tied to measures of ALS pathology (e.g., pathognomonic inclusions). To integrate and analyze relationships between data across modalities, we will develop a computational framework for harmonized analysis of multi-modal, multi- omic measures of ALS disease burden (Aim 2). Finally, we will implement highly multiplexed immuno-imaging to validate top gene candidates generated in Aim 1 at a single-cell level in situ (Aim 3). We expect to obtain an unmatched view of cellular interactions in the postmortem ALS M1 and SC, and to be able to directly link such interactions to features of ALS pathology in situ. This will allow us to identify dysregulated signaling that drives upper and lower motor neuron loss and associated symptoms in patients in ALS. Project Narrative Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease for which there are no biomarkers and only limited treatments stemming from a poor understanding of its pathogenesis. Here, we propose to integrate novel computational methods with spatially resolved transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of clinically deep-phenotyped postmortem ALS brains and spinal cords to determine the specific molecular correlates of functional impairment in this disease. By integrating these data with WGS and RNAseq data, our ultimate goal is to unveil how disease-associated variants drive specific dysfunction in ALS, which may in turn foster precision medicine-based

"The cerebro-cerebellar-basal-gangliar network for visuomotor learning ABSTRACT Visual learning is critical to the lives of human and non-human primates. Visuomotor association, the assignment of an arbitrary symbol to a particular movement (like a red light to a braking movement), is a well- studied form of visual learning. This proposal tests the hypothesis that the brain accomplishes visuomotor associative learning using an anatomically defined closed-loop network, including the prefrontal cortex, the basal ganglia, and the cerebellum. In our preliminary work we have developed a task that studies how monkeys learn to associate one of two novel fractal symbols with a right hand movement, and the other symbol with a left hand movement. Every experiment begins with the monkeys responding to two overtrained symbols that they have seen hundreds of thousands of times. At an arbitrary time we change the symbols to two fractal symbols that the monkey has never seen. It takes the monkey 40 to 70 trials to learn the new associations. In our preliminary results we have discovered that Purkinje cells in the midlateral cerebellar hemisphere track the monkeys’ learning as they as they figure out the required associations. The neurons signal the result of the prior decision. Half of the neurons respond more when the prior decision was correct; the others respond more when the prior decision was wrong. The difference between the activity of these two types of neurons provides a cognitive error signal that is maximal when the monkeys are performing at a chance level, and gradually becomes not different from zero as the monkeys learn the task. The neurons do not predict the result of the impending decision. Although the neurons change their activity dramatically at the symbol switch, the kinematics of the movements do not change at all. This proposal takes this discovery as the starting point for four aims: 1) to use viral transynaptic tract tracing to discover the cortical and basal ganglia regions that project to the cerebellar visuomotor association area. 2) to record from the four nodes of the network as anatomically defined (midlateral cerebellar hemisphere, dentate nucleus, basal ganglia, prefrontal cortex), simultaneously, using multiple single neuron recordings, to see if these areas also have information about the process of visuomotor association 3) to inactivate each node, to see how their inactivation affects the monkey’s ability to learn new associations, and whether the inactivation affects the activity of the neurons at the other nodes. 4) to develop computational methods to analyze the activity of neural activity recorded simultaneously in all four nodes of the network (Aim 2) in the midlateral cerebellar cortex with regard to parameters such as prior outcome and movement, hand, symbol, and the intensity and epoch of the prior cognitive error signal. We will use dimensional reduction techniques to answer questions like whether hand or symbol can be decoded from network activity. We will model how the cerebellum simple spike cognitive error signal might propagate through the network and be used to facilitate visuomotor association learning and the processing of signals in the cerebellum, basal ganglia and cerebral cortex Project Narrative Learning that a particular object cues a particular action, as a red light makes us stop walking or brake the car, is critical for human behavior and can be degraded by human disease. This project will apply physiological, computational, and anatomical methods to investigate a brain network for visual learning. We will find the exact areas of the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum that participate in this learning, and use machine learning techniques to understand how the activity of neurons recorded simultaneously in these brain areas can facilitate learning.",The cerebro-cerebellar-basal-gangliar network for visuomotor learning,10150927,R01NS113078,"['Affect ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Association Learning ', ' Basal Ganglia ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cerebellar Cortex ', ' Cerebellum ', ' Cerebral cortex ', ' Cognition ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' classical conditioning ', ' Associative Learning ', ' Pavlovian conditioning ', ' associative conditioning ', ' Cues ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Exhibits ', ' gamma-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' 4-Aminobutanoic Acid ', ' 4-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' 4-amino-butanoic acid ', ' Aminalon ', ' Aminalone ', ' GABA ', ' γ-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' Grant ', ' Hand ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Methods ', ' Monkeys ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Muscimol ', ' Agarin ', ' Pantherine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Purkinje Cells ', "" Purkinje's Corpuscles "", ' cerebellar Purkinje cell ', ' Rabies virus ', ' Reaction Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Response Time ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Reading ', ' Reflex action ', ' Reflex ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Suggestion ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Virus ', ' Work ', ' Walking ', ' Dentate nucleus ', ' nucleus dentatus ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Left ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Fractals ', ' Failure ', ' Visual ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' Agonist ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dimensions ', ' Parietal ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Viral ', ' visual learning ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' kinematic model ', ' kinematics ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' To specify ', ' Process ', ' Outcome ', ' visual motor ', ' visuomotor ', ' human disease ', ' motor learning ', ' locomotor learning ', ' motor control ', ' signal processing ', ' cognitive process ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' Injections ', ' Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network ', ' eMERGE Consortium ', ' eMERGE Network ', ' motor behavior ', ' ']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,1026631,NY-13
"Understanding the regulation of neuron cell number and arbor size PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT How the brain generates the correct number of neurons and how these neurons determine the size of their arbors to innervate the receptor field is a critical question in neurobiology. The Drosophila visual system is hard wired and iteratively organized into columns, providing an excellent model to answer these questions. Drosophila medulla multicolumnar neurons exhibit 5 to 750 neurons per cell type; each neuron class possesses a distinct morphology and projects its arbors across multiple columns in the optic lobe. The host lab has obtained single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data that determined the transcriptome of almost all optic lobe neuron cell types throughout development. The first aim of this project is to understand the molecular and cell biological mechanisms that dictate neuron number. Under the mentorship of Claude Desplan at New York University (K99 phase), I will perform genetics experiments that decisively address the role of programmed cell death, neural stem cell division number, and neuroepithelial size of origin in regulating the number of multicolumnar neurons produced. I will also perform lineage tracing experiments to determine whether molecularly similar cell types are generated at the same time. With Holger Knaut at NYU Medical Center, I will learn quantitative live imaging techniques to distinguish whether neural stem cells divide a limited number of times to generate low-abundance neural classes, or whether cell fusion of immature progenitors drives cell number. The second aim of this project is to determine the morphological and genetic processes that dictate the size and orientation of the arbors of multicolumnar to allow them to cover distinct receptor fields. With the bioinformatics expertise of Itai Yanai at NYU Medical Center, I will perform RNAseq on adult neurons that are not numerous enough to be identified in our existing scRNAseq data sets. I will then use machine learning algorithms to identify these neurons during development in our existing scRNAseq libraries and thus identify candidate genes required for the regulation of neuron number and arbor size (R00 phase). I will combine these molecular experiments with live imaging to quantitatively characterize how multicolumnar neurons determine the orientation and size of their arbors. Preliminary data indicates that cell death and the size of neuroepithelial region of origin in part dictate multicolumnar neuron number; I have also identified a neuropeptide whose function is essential for the regulation of neuron arbor size. My work will clarify the molecular basis of neuron abundance and determine how neurons present in small numbers regulate their arbor size to ensure that their environment is uniformly sampled, a problem common to many brain regions in most species. PROJECT NARRATIVE Understanding how neurons are generated in the correct numbers and how they appropriately space their arbors is of relevance to the fields of developmental neurobiology, neurology and regenerative medicine. Failure to properly specify or target neurons may cause congenital neurological diseases, and our work may identify molecular targets used for treatment. Comprehension of how neurons are made and how they target is also of relevance to regenerative medicine, as stem cell therapies will soon be able to generate diverse neural types which may be transplanted to treat blindness, brain injury and neurodegeneration.",Understanding the regulation of neuron cell number and arbor size,10104237,K99EY032269,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Biology ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cell Count ', ' Cell Number ', ' Cell Death ', ' necrocytosis ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Drosophila genus ', ' Drosophila ', ' fruit fly ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Ganglia ', ' Neural Ganglion ', ' Goals ', ' Kinetics ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Logic ', ' Maps ', ' Memory ', ' Mentorship ', ' Mosaicism ', ' mosaic disorders ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurology ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neuropeptides ', ' New York ', ' Optic Lobe ', ' Corpora Bigemina ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Photoreceptors ', ' Photoreceptor Cell ', ' Photosensitive Cell ', ' Visual Receptor ', ' Retina ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Comprehension ', ' Apoptosis ', ' Apoptosis Pathway ', ' Programmed Cell Death ', ' genetic manipulation ', ' gene manipulation ', ' genetically manipulate ', ' genetically perturb ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Neuropil ', ' Failure ', ' Visual ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' brain damage ', ' brain-injured ', ' Genetic ', ' Morphology ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' Medical center ', ' Visual System ', ' Visual system structure ', ' developmental neurobiology ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' neuroblast ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' stem cell based therapy ', ' stem cell mediated therapy ', ' stem cell therapeutics ', ' stem cell treatment ', ' stem cell-based treatment ', ' stem cell therapy ', ' neuroepithelium ', ' Neural Stem Cell ', ' neural precursor ', ' neural precursor cell ', ' neural progenitor ', ' neural progenitor cells ', ' neuron progenitors ', ' neuronal progenitor ', ' neuronal progenitor cells ', ' neuronal stem cells ', ' neuroprogenitor ', ' nerve stem cell ', ' Genetic Processes ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' stem cell renewal ', ' stem cell division ', ' Regenerative Medicine ', ' Cell fusion ', ' Brain region ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Inhibition of Apoptosis ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Mutate ', ' Cell Death Inhibition ', ' Neuroepithelial ', ' Transcript ', ' To specify ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' fly ', ' Flies ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' two-photon ', ' 2-photon ', ' Population ', ' somatosensory ', ' progenitor ', ' retinotopic ', ' overexpression ', ' overexpress ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' ']",NEI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,140333,NY-12
"Role of the Hippocampal-mPFC Pathway in Social Memory Deficits in Autism PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The hippocampus is critical for the formation and consolidation of spatial memories and contributes to other cognitive tasks through its efferent projections. The goal of this project is to determine whether altered neuronal network activity in the hippocampus of an autism mouse model propagates to, and alters distal cortical regions involved in social behaviors.  One of the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorders, such as Rett syndrome (RTT), is a deficit in social interaction. In mice, similar social behavior impairments can be modeled by altering the excitation and inhibition (E/I) balance in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). For RTT, knocking out the gene that is mutated in humans, Mecp2, causes hyperactivity in the ventral hippocampus (vHIP) due to an E/I imbalance driven by impaired inhibition and enhanced excitation, resulting in saturated synaptic plasticity at excitatory synapses. Intriguingly, CA1 pyramidal neurons of the vHIP project their axons to the mPFC, making direct monosynaptic connections with excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons. We propose to characterize how the vHIP influences mPFC activity through this long-range monosynaptic glutamatergic projection. Importantly, we will test whether altered vHIP network activity is causal to mPFC dysfunction and deficits in social interaction. We hypothesize that atypically strong vHIP afferents alter network activity in the mPFC of Mecp2 KO mice by affecting the E/I balance and synaptic plasticity, which in turn contributes to social interaction deficits. To test this hypothesis, we will identify the cellular targets of direct vHIP afferents in the mPFC of RTT mice and characterize their function in social behaviors using a combination of optogenetics, chemogenetics, ex vivo and in vivo electrophysiology and Ca2+ imaging, anterograde and retrograde tract tracing, and unbiased machine-learning behavioral assessments.  We propose the following Specific Aims: 1) identify and characterize the cellular targets of the monosynaptic projection from the vHIP to the mPFC in Mecp2 KO mice; 2) characterize long-term synaptic plasticity of the vHIP-mPFC projection in Mecp2 KO mice; and 3) determine if chemogenetic modulation of the activity of mPFC-projecting vHIP neurons alters mPFC function and social behaviors.  These studies will provide fundamental information on the functional and structural properties of the long- range connection between the vHIP and mPFC in the developing brain. The impact of this work extends beyond RTT to other neuropsychiatric disorders in which propagation of network dysfunction from the hippocampus to the mPFC is believed to contribute to cognitive deficits. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rett syndrome is a syndromic autism-spectrum disorder that presents with deficits in social behaviors and cognitive abilities, which may result from impaired function of the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. The proposed study is the first characterization of a long-range monosynaptic connection in Rett mice using optogenetics and chemogenetics, and will test whether hippocampal hyperactivity propagates to the medial prefrontal cortex, leading to autism-related social deficits.",Role of the Hippocampal-mPFC Pathway in Social Memory Deficits in Autism,10087555,R01MH118563,"['Affect ', ' Axon ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Genes ', ' Glutamates ', ' L-Glutamate ', ' glutamatergic ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Rett Syndrome ', ' Cerebroatrophic Hyperammonemia ', ' Rett Disorder ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Opsin ', ' Rod-Opsin ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2 ', ' MeCP-2 protein ', ' MeCP2 ', ' MeCP2 protein ', ' Methyl CpG Binding Protein 2 ', ' Methyl CpG binding protein MeCP2 ', ' Methyl-CpG binding protein 2 ', ' Methyl-DNA binding protein MECP2 ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Medial ', ' Distal ', ' Site ', ' Synaptic Potentials ', ' Long-Term Potentiation ', ' Longterm Potentiation ', ' Knockout Mice ', ' KO mice ', ' Knock-out Mice ', ' Null Mouse ', ' Link ', ' Fiber ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Confocal Microscopy ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Morphology ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Contralateral ', ' System ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' cellular targeting ', ' Structure ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Long-Term Synaptic Depression ', ' longterm depression ', ' longterm synaptic depression ', ' Long-Term Depression ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' Symptoms ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Mutate ', ' in vivo ', ' Excitatory Synapse ', ' Slice ', ' Wild Type Mouse ', ' wildtype mouse ', ' Knock-out ', ' Knockout ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' hippocampal pyramidal neuron ', ' Pyramidal neuron ', ' network dysfunction ', ' Synaptic plasticity ', ' Impairment ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' behavioral impairment ', ' impaired behavior ', ' optogenetics ', ' cognitive task ', ' cognitive ability ', ' spatial memory ', ' designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs ', ' DREADDs ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' voltage sensitive dye ', ' potentiometric dye ', ' social deficits ', ' social defects ', ' social disorders ', ' social dysfunction ', ' postnatal development ', ' post-natal development ', ' Hyperactivity ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2021,393603,AL-07
"Emergence of Functional Network Dynamics from Single Cell Properties Project Summary/Abstract The collective dynamics of the network of neurons in the brain drive its primary holistic function — control of organismal behavior. Pathologies of the nervous system that disrupt this coordinated activity result in dysfunctional patterns of motor output and gross behavior. However, it is unknown how patterns of coordinated activity arise from the properties of single neurons and their connections. In the next five years we seek to develop a rigorous theory and biologically realistic model of the emergence of coordinated dynamics in a complete network of neurons, similar to the current level of understanding of how the dynamics of interacting molecular species produce goal-directed motile behavior in single-cell bacteria. We focus on the relatively simple nervous system of C. elegans; with precisely 302 neurons, it is a natural choice for such fundamental neurodynamical studies. To attack this problem, the research in our lab utilizes a fusion of experimental and computational approaches including advanced microscopy, genomic engineering, machine learning based image processing, quantitative behavior, and dynamical systems analysis. We have developed novel approaches to quantitatively probe and characterize the signal processing properties of single neurons as well as record and quantify the activity of the entire C. elegans nervous system at single-cell resolution using volumetric calcium imaging under genetic perturbation. We are now exploring the relationship between the microscopic properties of cellular signaling and the macroscopic function of collective network dynamics. A mechanistic model of the composition and maintenance of structured, controlled brain dynamics would provide a framework for understanding how gross neurological disease states arise from cellular and molecular dysfunction. Project Narrative A basic theory and data driven model of the emergence of collective, coordinated network dynamics based on the properties of neurons is lacking. Such a theory would provide a framework for understanding how dysfunction at the cellular or molecular level leads to gross neurological disease states.

"Rapid Evaluation of Neuronal Activity in the Intact Whole Brain at Single Cell Resolution Project Summary  Here we seek to develop a “Neuronal Activity Quantitative Diagnostic” platform and reagent kits to disseminate accessible products for measuring recent neural activity across the entire mouse brain to the neuroscience community. Previously we have shown that the activity-dependent immediate-early gene protein products Npas4 and cFos can be clearly detected, imaged, and quantified using developmental versions of our platform tools. Immediate early genes are genes that are activated transiently and rapidly in response to a wide variety of cellular stimuli. The three overlapping aims to be investigated in this Phase II project are:  1) Demonstration of the fidelity of our assay for our customers. To demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of our neuronal activity assay with another well-known assay for activity, we will perform two photon calcium fluorescence imaging in the primary visual cortex of mice presented with repeated visual stimuli. We will clear and stain the brains for cFos and Npas4 and demonstrate the fidelity of these markers for detecting recently active neurons.  2) Develop and beta test robust versions of our software tools useable by researchers with no specialized coding or statistics knowledge. We will develop Stitchy and BrainSnap into robust, user-friendly software products that remove the current analysis bottleneck for neuroscientists interested in whole-brain imaging. Stitchy will be an improved browser-based version of our internal software that simplifies and speeds the process of stitching together light sheet microscope images. BrainSnap software will integrate our high-performance 3TK- Quant framework for machine learning-enabled quantification and our statistical framework for whole-brain anatomics, 3TK-Stats, in a browser-based interface. We have recruited end users who will test this software in a head-to-head comparison with our in-house testing.  3) Develop and test a brain clearing and staining kit for neuronal activity. To help researchers produce high quality cleared brains stained with neuronal activity markers, we will generate Neuronal Activity clearing and staining reagents kits for cFos and Npas4. These will be tested by collaborators in head-to-head comparisons with our in-house procedures on brains prepared in parallel.

"Unraveling the neural basis of female aggression and dementia-related aggression: a systems biology approach. Project Summary Males and females elicit aggressive behavior for resources and survival. Male aggression has been well studied in many species. However, not much is known about female aggression. Recently, my work identified a small female- specific subgroup of cells in the pC1 brain region (pC1α neurons), that triggered females to fight at extremely high intensity levels when activated. For the K99 phase, I will build on my previous work and elaborate on the pC1α neurons circuitry under the mentorship of Dr. E. Kravitz, a well-renowned expert in aggression and Drosophila genetics. Aim 1 is concerned with determining the pre- and post-synaptic partners of the pC1α neurons. For this aim, I will work with my co-mentor, Dr. R. Wilson, to determine pre- and post- synaptic partners and design transgenic fly lines to target these areas. Based on my preliminary data of electron microscopy tracings, I hypothesize that, a)SAG neurons provide inputs to pC1α neurons; and b) pC1α neurons project dendritic outputs to PVL04om_pct neurons in areas previously identified in aggression such as Posterior Lateral Protocerebrum. I anticipate that both up- and down-stream pC1α neurons partners will induce high intensity female aggression. Aim 2 will investigate the role of candidate aggression-associated genes in pC1α neurons. I will train in single-cell profiling methods (used by the Kravitz lab) and address the hypothesis that genes overexpressed in male aggression mediating neurons also play key role in pC1α neuron function. In collaboration with co-mentor Dr. B de Bivort, I will also use neural network-based body part tracking software to train a classifier to automatically label aggressive behaviors. This will allow me to use machine-learning algorithms to capture multi-dimensional representations of the phenotypic differences among fly lines with mutations and transgenic effectors that target aggression circuits (e.g, activating and inhibiting a neuron or overexpressing aggregating proteins). The trainings acquired in my mentored K99 phase will facilitate my transition to independent research studying age-related diseases and behavior. Severe behavioral disturbances of aggression and agitation have been reported to be increasingly common during the progression of Alzheimer's disease and other related dementias.The reasons for this are completely unknown. Moreover, there is a dearth of understanding of how changes in neurons, during neurodegeneration, lead to specific behavioral defects. For the R00 phase, I will shift my focus to looking at aggression in neurodegenerative disease models and begin my efforts by elucidating the contribution of neuronal protein aggregates of Aβ-42 to aggression. My preliminary data indicates that overexpression of human Aβ-42 in using a (pan-neuronal driver) in males and (cholinergic driver) in females induces heightend levels of aggression. Based on these findings, I hypothesize Aβ-42 overexpression induced aggression is due to altered excitability of key aggression promoting neurons. I plan to use diverse and integrative systems approaches (learned from my mentored phase). I will lead a multi-pronged research effort to understand the mechanisms by which neurons regulate their normal function in the presence of an aging and or neurodegenerative disease state and how these changes affect circuit pathways and ultimately aggression. Project Narrative Aggression accompanies a number of common human neurodegenerative disorders (e.g. Alzheimer's and other related dementias), with little understanding of how cognitive and aggression symptoms may be linked at the neuronal level. Aggression has been extensively studied in males of many species, but neglected in females (likewise, the interaction of sex and age is neglected). The objective of this research program is to identify the neural circuitry that governs female aggression (K99- mentored phase) and later transition (R00- independent phase) into discovering mechanisms of dementia-related pathology and how these changes affect aggression.",Unraveling the neural basis of female aggression and dementia-related aggression: a systems biology

"Discovering the molecular genetic principles of cell type organization through neurobiology-guided computational analysis of single cell multi-omics data sets ABSTRACT Understanding the biological principles of cell type diversity and organization is necessary for deciphering neural circuits underlying brain function. The recent rapid accumulation of single cell transcriptomic and epigenomic data sets provides unprecedented opportunity to explore the molecular genetic basis of cell type identity, diversity, and organization. However, analysis of multi-omics datasets have been largely driven by statistic methods that typically do not engage the deep knowledge of neurobiology and developmental biology. As such, most statistic methods do not distinguish technical noise and methodological biases from biologically relevant signals and relationships, and have limited power in achieving biological discovery and insight. Neurobiology guided feature selection based on inherent physiological and developmental processes is essential to move beyond simple statistical clustering of molecular types towards achieving multi-modal definition of neuron types and revealing their inherent relationships as a taxonomy. We have discovered that transcriptional architectures of synaptic input/output (I/O) communication may underlie the essence of cortical GABAergic neuron identity. We hypothesize that transcriptional architectures of synaptic communication is a general defining feature for brain neuron types. We will test this hypothesis by performing a series of supervised learning and feature selection analyses of publically available and emerging single sc-transcriptomic data sets across brain areas and systems from the BRIAN Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN). We further hypothesize that cell type transcriptional signatures of synaptic communication is orchestrated by well-defined gene regulatory programs rooted in epignomic landscape. We will test this hypothesis by joint analysis of sc-transcriptome, ATACseq, and DNA methylome dataset of the same cortical cell populations from BICCN to identify co-expressed gene signatures that reliably define cell identity, focusing on signatures of synaptic communication. Based on transcriptomic and epigenomic architecture of synaptic communication, we will further develop neurobiology guided feature selection algorithms to improve and refine the current statistical clustering the cortical transcriptomic types. In addition, we will generate web portal tools for automated classification of transcriptomic cell types. Our study will establish a unified paradigm of neuronal cell type organization in which epignomic landscape configures core gene regulatory programs to shape synaptic communication properties that define cardinal neuron types. Together, this work will establish a molecular genetic framework for understanding neuronal diversity and achieving a biological classification across brain areas and mammalian species. PROJECT NARRATIVE Understanding the biological principles of neuronal cell type diversity and organization is necessary for deciphering neural circuits underlying brain function and disorders. We will develop and apply supervised machine learning – based algorithms to the analysis of the rapidly accumulating single cell molecular genetics data sets across the mammalian species from the BRAIN Initiative.

"The Nanoscale Connectome of the Cochlear Nucleus The cochlear nucleus is the gateway for central nervous system processing of auditory information in mammals. It has been proposed that parallel processing channels are set up in the CN, and these form the basis for further computation at higher stations of the auditory system. Despite decades of study, enumeration of CN cell types is incomplete and CN circuitry is described only superficially. In neuroscience generally, classification and naming of neurons has relied primarily upon qualitative approaches based upon human observational capabilities. We have implemented and in some cases developed novel high-throughput and unbiased techniques for labeling, segmenting and classifying neurons in 3D, generated from large-scale electron microscopy image volumes. We propose to deliver a nanoscale map, or connectome, of the mouse CN with enumerated and localized cell types and their synaptic connections. This effort is unbiased because all neurons will be sampled. To achieve this goal, we bring together four parallel modes of tissue analysis for neuron classification: morphology, connectivity, molecular identity and function. We propose that connectivity analysis will define long-proposed parallel processing circuits that will be tested functionally using realistic biophysical models of identified cell types. Notably, the cochlear nucleus contains both amorphous and layered organizations of cells, which serve as templates for all other brain regions. By investigating the fundamental structure of this sensory center, we will establish principles of neural computation and methods for structural and functional phenotyping that will apply to other brain regions regardless of their particular neural architecture. Relevance to Public Health The goal of this project is to deliver to the auditory research community the connectome of the mouse cochlear nucleus. In the process we will refine and develop comprehensive and high throughput methods to catalogue cell types and their connections in any brain region, and will provide molecular phenotypes for cochlear nucleus cell types that may be useful in their targeted manipulation for research and therapeutic purposes.

"Molecular characterization of extracellular vesicles for the spread of misfolded tau protein Neurofibrillary tangles, composed of intracellular aggregates of hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau (tau), are by far the most correlated pathology for clinical symptoms of Alzheimer disease (AD). Emerging evidence suggests that extracellular vesicles (EVs, such as exosomes and microvesicles), transfer pathological tau between cells as vehicles, propagating tau pathology. It is urgently important to find the molecular basis of brain-derived EVs, which may critically regulate EV uptake by neurons and aggregation of tau protein in EVs and/or recipient neurons. We have recently established the method for isolating EVs from human brain samples and successfully performed their proteomic profiling. We found that selective molecules from the EV proteomics datasets were able to differentiate human AD-EV from healthy control (CTRL)-EV with 88% accuracy by machine learning analysis, confirming pathogenic character of AD-EV molecules. Furthermore, our exciting preliminary data have shown that AD-EV have significantly higher tau seeding activity compared to CTRL-EV by FRET sensor tau seeding assay with subsets of EV molecules showing significant association with tau seeding activity. This proposed project will fortify these preliminary results and find the converging or specific mechanisms among tauopathies for mediating tau aggregation and its seeding via EV uptake through proteomics and biological examination of brain-derived EV samples. To meet this challenge, we assembled a multi-disciplinary team of investigators who have a strong record of accomplishments in biologic (Ikezu), proteomic (Emili) and bioengineering and bioinformatic analysis (Issador). In Aim1, we will examine EV samples from 240 new brain specimens (40 AD, 40 CTE, 40 LBD, 40 PSP, 40 CBD and 40 CTRL) for precision mass-spectrometry-based proteomics and tau-interactomes, and analyze those datasets by the machine learning approach. Aim 2 will examine the efficiency of tau propagation using tau fibrils, oligomers and EVs isolated from the same donors of the 5 different tauopathies and control cases in vitro and in vivo using FRET-based tau seeding assay and EV uptake by primary cultured mouse cortical neurons in vitro. EV-associated tau will be further characterized by the biochemical and microscopy-based analysis for their conformational and posttranslational changes. We will evaluate the difference in tau propagation after the intracranial injection of the tau seeds from different tauopathy brains using our recently established mouse models. Aim3 will identify candidate molecules most likely involved in EV uptake and tau seeding activity by bioinformatic analysis of the proteome dataset (Aim 1) and biological datasets (Aim 2). We will then test the functional roles of the identified molecules on EV uptake, tau seeding activities and neuronal firing activities in vitro. The candidate molecules will be specifically targeted by gene silencing or antagonists for their therapeutic potential to halt tau propagation in vitro and in vivo. Successful identification of responsible molecules for tau propagation will serve as a foundation for understanding EV-mediated disease progression. We propose to achieve highly comprehensive characterization of the protein composition of extracellular vesicles in human brain tissues, and determine their emerging roles on enhancing neuronal uptake of vesicle associated tau and spread of tau pathology in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons. The candidate molecules will be specifically targeted by specific antagonistic reagents for their therapeutic potential for halting tau propagation in vivo. These studies will lead to a better understanding of vesicle-mediated disease spread mechanism in Alzheimer's disease and related tauopathy.",Molecular characterization of extracellular vesicles for

"From diverse dynamics to diverse computation via neural cell types Project Summary A prominent feature of biological neuronal networks is the astonishing diversity of their cell types. Major, nationally coordinated experimental efforts, including the BRAIN Initiative’s Cell Census Network (BICCN) and the Allen Institute Cell Types programs, are currently revealing this cellular diversity at new and very high levels of resolution. For example, just across two areas of mouse cortex 133 cell types have been characterized, with many types shared across areas! Similar cell classes have been observed across species. These types show marked differences not only gene expression and connectivity, but also membrane, spiking, and synaptic dynamics. This is in sharp contrast to most computational and theoretical models of learning in neural networks, which generally make use of only one or a small number of cell types. The goal of this project is to produce new computational and theoretical tools to help close this gap. This will enable us, and the broader community, to test a hypothesis for the functional role of cell-type specific, heterogeneous cellular and synaptic dynamics: that they can be harnessed to generate complex network dynamics which allows faster or more accurate learning of tasks which themselves have inputs or objectives which have complex dynamics. Such tasks abound in natural environments. Testing this hypothesis requires new high-throughput computational tools to train neural networks with biologically realistic dynamics and connectivity to solve tasks, new theoretical tools to understand how diverse cellular dynamics contribute to network computation, and new application to large-scale, cellular data-driven models. First, with the expertise of a grant-supported scientific software engineer, will build, test, and disseminate a software package that flexibly implements heterogeneous dynamics of single cells and short-term synaptic dynamics. We plan to use a very popular, freely available and open source software framework for machine learning (Pytorch). Next, we will establish metrics of network dynamics that help to mechanistically explain what does -- and does not -- matter about cellular and synaptic heterogeneity in impacting learning performance. Finally, we will integrate these tools with a prior cell-type specific computational model of the mouse primary visual cortex, based on large scale Allen Institute databases, to test the hypothesis stated above. Specifically, we will newly determine whether experimentally observed levels of heterogeneity in cellular and synaptic dynamics contribute to the ability of visual microcircuits to perform visual computation. Project Narrative The brain is composed of a large number of cell types, each with diverse dynamical properties that vary robustly from type to type. We propose to study the role of this diversity in how circuits in the brain compute, by building new tools that will enable the community to simulate and analyze learning in neural networks with complex cellular components.",From diverse dynamics to diverse computation via neural cell types,10263658,RF1DA055669,"['Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Fire - disasters ', ' Fires ', ' fire ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Institutes ', ' Learning ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Engineering ', ' Computer Software Development ', ' Computer Software Engineering ', ' area striata ', ' Primary visual cortex ', ' Striate Cortex ', ' Striate area ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Visual Cortex ', ' visual cortical ', ' Weight ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Visual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' Visual System ', ' Visual system structure ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' Performance ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' member ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Property ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' large-scale database ', ' large-scale data base ', ' open source ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' network models ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' BRAIN initiative ', ' Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies initiative ', ' Software Framework ', ' neural network ', ' computational basis ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NIDA,ALLEN INSTITUTE,RF1,2021,1115283,WA-07
"Combined Mechanistic and Input-Output Modeling of the Hippocampus During Spatial Navigation PROJECT ABSTRACT Large-scale realistic model of neuronal network is a powerful tool for studying neural dynamics and cognitive functions. It integrates multi-scale neurobiological mechanisms/processes identified through diverse hypotheses and experimental data into a single platform. However, due to its high complexity and lack of neuron-to-neuron correspondence to experimental data, it is difficult to constrain, validate and optimize such a model using large- scale neural activities recorded from behaving animals, which are most relevant to cognitive processes. We propose to develop a novel modeling paradigm inspired by the generative adversarial network (GAN) to synergistically combine both mechanistic and input-output (machine learning) modeling techniques to build large- scale realistic models that are functionally indistinguishable from actual neuronal networks. We will apply this paradigm to the modeling of the hippocampus to reveal how spatial information is encoded and re-encoded in the hippocampal neuronal networks during navigation. Specifically, full-scale mechanistic model of the hippocampus will be constructed as the generative model to simulate how hippocampal circuits generate ensemble spiking activities in response to 2D trajectories during navigation. Large-scale population-level input- output models will be developed to statistically characterize input-output properties of the real hippocampus and the hippocampal mechanistic model. The input-output models of the mechanistic model will be evaluated by a discriminator against the ground truth input-output models of the real hippocampus. This forms the discriminative model that (1) identifies discrepancies between the mechanistic model and the real hippocampus, and (2) guides the optimization/modification of neuron model and connectivity parameters of the generative model. This procedure will be performed iteratively until the discriminator fails to distinguish the generative (mechanistic) model from the real hippocampus. In addition, the modifications to the mechanistic model generated by this paradigm will provide falsifiable predictions that can be further tested experimentally. We expect to use this combined mechanistic and input-output modeling strategy to unveil how (1) causal relations between spiking activities across different hippocampal subregions, and (2) place fields of hippocampal neurons, are determined by multi-scale neurobiological mechanisms and the interplay between these mechanisms. The proposed methodology will provide a general computational framework for integrating biological knowledge, hypotheses, and large-scale input-output data to gain deeper and more quantitative understanding of cognitive functions. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to develop a novel modeling paradigm inspired by the generative adversarial network (GAN) that synergistically combines both mechanistic and input-output (machine learning) modeling techniques to build a large-scale realistic model of the hippocampus that are functionally indistinguishable from the real hippocampus.

"Mapping the neural circuitry underlying walking Project Summary Walking is an essential and conserved behavior across the animal kingdom. The ability to move in a coordinated, robust yet flexible manner is a crucial for an animal’s survival in the ever changing environment. Motor behaviors are controlled by sensory neuropils in the brain which talk to motor centers such as the ventral nerve cord (VNC) in the thorax to execute precise motor outputs. Descending neurons are the primary conduits of information that accomplish this connection between the brain and the VNC. However the downstream target neurons and complex circuits that precisely govern the execution of a specific kind of limbed motor output such as running, turning, slowing down, switching gait, climbing, stepping etc remain individually undefined. This project aims to map these individual circuits that control different walking kinematics. In aim 1, we will map the post-synaptic targets of descending neurons using a translabeling technique called Trans Tango. We already know from previous studies that have characterized the morphology of all the descending neurons in Drosophila, which DNs target the leg neuropils in the ventral nerve chord. These descending neurons are very likely to be directly implicated in controlling walking behavior. Additionally, we also have broad behavioral information for a subset of the DNs. Using this existing morphological and behavioral data, we can start to map out the motor and premotor circuits that are downstream of these DNs and reveal the distinct circuit components that control specific walking kinematics. Some of the DNs we plan to screen, affect similar behaviors hence it will be interesting to reveal whether they converge onto similar or different targets. In the second aim, we aim to use a computational approach search for generation Gal4 lines whose neuronal expression patterns match the downstream target neurons we want to study. Existing split Gal4 lines will be identified or new ones will be generated in order to gain genetic access to the downstream circuit neurons of interest. In the third aim, we will use three behavior setups: Flywalker, the Arena and the fly-on-ball setup to study a range of walking parameters in high resolution using optogenetics intersectional strategies. We will use optogenetic activation, silencing and also epistasis experiments to map out which components of the circuit are sufficient or necessary for a particular walking kinematic. Project Narrative An animal’s ability to walk in a regulated manner is controlled by the brain through coordinated neural circuitry. Descending neurons are the bridges connecting the brain to the motor centers in thorax that then controls limbed coordination and movement but the exact circuitry downstream of descending neurons responsible for walking remain undefined. This project aims to map these downstream functional circuit components using neuronal translabeling approaches and assess their contribution to precise, robust and flexible motor behavior in Drosophila.",Mapping the neural circuitry underlying walking,10201434,F32MH123012,"['Affect ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Anions ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cloning ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drosophila genus ', ' Drosophila ', ' fruit fly ', ' Environment ', ' Genetic Epistasis ', ' Epistasis ', ' Epistatic Deviation ', ' Interaction Deviation ', ' epistatic relationship ', ' gene x gene interaction ', ' genetic epistases ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Gait ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Nerve ', ' Neural Pathways ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Afferent Neurons ', ' Sensory Cell Afferent Neuron ', ' Sensory Neurons ', ' Play ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rhodopsin ', ' Visual Purple ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Generations ', ' Walking ', ' Label ', ' Link ', ' motor disorder ', ' motor disease ', ' motor dysfunction ', ' Neuropil ', ' Individual ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Genetic ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' interest ', ' brain control ', ' mind control ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' kinematic model ', ' kinematics ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Thorace ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorax ', ' Chest ', ' Leg ', ' ARNT ', ' Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Nuclear Translocator ', ' Dioxin Receptor, Nuclear Translocator ', ' HIF-1 Beta Gene ', ' HIF-1Beta Gene ', ' HIF-1beta ', ' HIF1-Beta Gene ', ' HIF1B ', ' HIF1B Gene ', ' HIF1Beta ', ' HIF1beta Gene ', ' Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1 Beta Gene ', ' Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, Beta subunit ', ' Nuclear Translocator Gene Dioxin Receptor ', ' TANGO ', ' ARNT gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Resolution ', ' Behavioral ', ' fly ', ' Flies ', ' Output ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Motor output ', ' motor control ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' optogenetics ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' neural network ', ' motor behavior ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F32,2021,73890,NY-13
"Optoretinography: All-optical measures of functional activity in the human retina Project Summary/Abstract The last few decades have seen major inroads into detailing the physiological mechanisms supporting vision as well as therapies aimed at rescue and repair of neurons affected by retinal diseases. For the continued evolution of treatments and their rapid translation to the clinic, it is essential to find a non-invasive, all-optical biomarker to monitor the efficacy of disease and potential therapeutic agents. To this end, we propose to develop the optoretinogram, or ORG, the optical analog to the electroretinogram (ERG) which is the current gold standard for retinal function assessment in humans. The ORG is rooted in classical interferometry and enables a highly sensitive assay of how neurons interact with light. Using this technique, our group has demonstrated the ability to visualize light-driven neural activity across a range of spatiotemporal resolution – from single cells to a collection of neurons, and from µsecs to ms timescales. Here, we aim to expand the capabilities of the ORG and demonstrate its efficacy for basic science and clinical applications. The proposed technology is built upon a solid foundation of established approaches, and combines them in new and complementary ways to achieve an optimal combination of speed, resolution and sensitivity geared towards overcoming the key challenges faced with imaging cellular structure-function in humans. The core technologies are phase-resolved OCT, an eye-safe, interferometric method to measure nm-scale changes at ms time scales in vivo, adaptive optics (AO) to overcome ocular aberrations, increase the signal-to-noise and allow resolution down to single cells and real-time eye tracking to overcome eye motion and allow targeting, recording and averaging of responses from single and a collection of retinal neurons. These are implemented across three ORG platforms. At the University of Washington, we will refine the line-scan phase-resolved OCT with improvements in optical design and eye-tracking and use it to characterize the basic properties of phototransduction and inner retinal function in healthy human volunteers and patients with retinal degenerations. At Stanford University, we will develop a similar line-scan system for rodents, and together with transgenic models and pharmacology, determine the biophysical mechanisms that underlie the ORG and develop templates for human recordings. At UC Berkeley, we will push the envelope of speed and sensitivity by incorporating a real-time eye-tracking system to drive an AO-OCT interferometric probe, with the aim to measure the tiniest and briefest neuronal changes in the human retina. This bioengineering research partnership will benefit from complementary expertise, research direction and ORG implementation across the three sites, and the use of common approaches for image/data analysis, eye tracking and visual stimulation. Ultimately, the aggregate technology will facilitate a deeper mechanistic understanding of early visual processing and eye disease, and provide entirely new avenues for accelerating therapeutic interventions. Project Narrative This proposal outlines a plan to develop the technology for measuring the Optoretinogram, or ORG: the all- optical recording of functional activity of retinal neurons and their connections in a living eye. We employ a unique combination of technologies (OCT, adaptive optics, interferometry, eye-tracking) that together enable in vivo access to the early visual processing elements in the retina in humans. In the end, we envision powerful, clinically deployable tools suited to test and accelerate the new generation of treatments aimed at regenerating neurons and neural connections in the eye and visual

"Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to understand how the relationships between genes contribute to functional properties in neurons and how those functions combine to define types of neurons. This is a central question of basic neuroscience, and one which is newly assessable using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). These data provide high-throughput snapshots of gene activities across thousands of cells and thus shed new light on the relationships between genes within and across cells. We propose to exploit this data in conjunction with previously known details about gene function and neuronal identity to learn new features of both. Our research approach is meta-analytic, using data from many different laboratories to obtain a more robust aggregate signal. In addition to developing meta-analytic methods to pursue our direct research interests, the methods are of broad practical relevance to neuroscience laboratories studying many different questions, including diseases of the nervous system. Disseminating our software deliverables in a convenient-to-use form is a central component of each of our research objectives. The three complementary objectives in this project are to: 1. Learn patterns of gene expression which characterize known cell identity. Building on our previous research showing conserved expression patterns across cell-types, we will define shared gene expression patterns, called co-expression, specific to neuronal sub-populations. These shared expression patterns will be used as an assay into cellular identity. 2.Identify novel cell subtypes through changes in the expression relationships between genes. Variation in co-expression is a form of transcriptional rewiring which often indicates a change in function. To find novel neuronal sub-types we will assess the data for changes in co-expression reflecting a change in functions linked to neuronal identity. We will identify novel transcriptional signatures which replicate across laboratories. 3. Determine consensus methods for customized cell-type learning. Defining wholly unknown expression profiles is likely to benefit from a variety of approaches. In order to find agreement between those approaches, we will develop an algorithm to efficiently search through gene sets likely to find those with complementary value. These gene sets will then be assessed across many pre-existing methods, with customized combinations and aggregate output reported and made available through a public web-server. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent advances in genetics have it made possible to assess gene activity at a cellular level. The primary goal of this project is to develop and validate methods and data resources which combine data from many laboratories to identify how genes interact to produce different functional effects in different types of neurons. Because most gene functions are accomplished in concert with other genes, knowing how genes change their interactions provides key information into how their function might be disrupted in disease.",Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis,10224662,R01MH113005,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Crowding ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Joints ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Methods ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Noise ', ' Phenotype ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Custom ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' gene function ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' exhaustion ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Ablation ', ' functional group ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Property ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Transcript ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Grouping ', ' groupings ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Output ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' Expression Signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' gene expression signature ', ' transcriptional profile ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' transcriptomics ', ' candidate marker ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' screening ', ' Data Discovery ', ' data resource ', ' in situ sequencing ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' web server ', ' learning algorithm ', ' ']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2021,480000,NY-03
"Electrophysiological Evaluation of Brain Regions Vulnerable to Alzheimers Disease The entorhinal cortex (EC) is long known to be the region affected first in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) with symptoms such as disorientation, confusion and inability to navigate appearing early in life. But more recently, a region in the brainstem- locus coeruleus (LC) was found to have tau accumulation in young healthy adults, making it the first region in the brain with AD pathology. The LC is known to be important for arousal and controls the sleep/wake switch. The neurons of LC project to several regions including EC and hippocampus which are known to be important for spatial memory. Unsurprisingly, one of the earliest symptoms of AD is spatial difficulties and it is possible that early pathology in LC affects sleep leading to spatial memory deficits. With both LC and EC important for memory, we aim to identify which of them is more vulnerable to tau and Aβ pathology. To explore this possibility, we will first inject LC and EC regions of wildtype mouse with pathological tau derived from human AD brains to make them dysfunctional, and evaluate their neuronal function. We will also assess sleep and test memory performance in relevant behavior tasks. To understand how aβ affects tau pathology, we will inject human tau in the APP Knock-In mice which has physiological amounts of APP expressed in them. We will determine if Aβ together with tau worsens the neuronal function of LC and EC neurons and it sleep and memory is impaired further. We will use multi-region silicon probes to simultaneously record activity from LC or medial EC and hippocampal neurons. The MEC and hippocampal neurons are well characterized with properties that can be easily measured using spatial navigation tasks. We will make use of virtual reality head-fixed setup for the animals to navigate in, and allowing us to quickly test animal’s memory in any context and environment. The animals will be tested for object-location memory and context-dependent memory in virtual environment. We will use machine learning algorithms to decode animal’s position in the LC, MEC and HPC neural data and determine if it is affected by tau or Aβ or both. We will also assess sleep parameters and correlate with memory. We hypothesize that tau in LC and EC will make its neurons dysfunctional and directly affect sleep and memory, and this in concert with Aβ will exacerbate neuronal dysfunction leading to increased sleep problems and spatial memory impairment as seen in early AD. With this we aim to identify electrophysiological biomarker of neuronal dysfunction before the onset of behavioral troubles. We will test if increasing the neuronal firing in hypoactive neurons and reducing the firing in hyperactive neurons will restore downstream neuronal dysfunction and reverse sleep problems and cognitive impairment. The proposal brings together diverse fields (neuroscience, pathology and computational neuroscience) applying large-scale recording techniques simultaneously across multiple brain regions to develop analytical and predictive tests to interrogate function in vulnerable brain regions that are dysfunctional in AD. The locus coeruleus and the entorhinal cortex region of the brain are among the first to be affected in Alzheimer’s disease, causing sleep problems and cognitive dysfunction. Using multi-region recording probes we will evaluate their function to determine which one of them is more vulnerable to tau and aβ pathology. We will test if by using optogenetic approach the neurons in these regions can be rescued and cognitive deficits be reversed.",Electrophysiological Evaluation of Brain Regions Vulnerable to Alzheimers

"Diversity supplement to Analysis of Nonstationary Point Process Data Project Summary Much mental health research uses neurophysiological measurements to describe the way neural activity within and across brain regions is related to behavioral function and dysfunction. One kind of signal, known as a spike train, comes from an individual neuron. Another, the local field potential (LFP), is based on activity from large numbers of neurons within specified parts of the brain. For both kinds of data, scientifically rigorous statistical analysis must accommodate unstable fluctuations, associated with movement or thought, known in statistics as non- stationarity. The continuing research program of this grant is to develop methods for analyzing non-stationary neural data. Of particular interest is the description of interactions among two or more brain areas. This application is for an administrative supplement to support an under-represented minority PhD student for two years. As documented by, among others, the National Science Foundation, people of African ancestry are severely under-represented in the sciences. The training provided to the candidate, under this supplement, would serve to elevate the candidate's research profile, and would ultimately contribute to enhancing diversity in the STEM workforce. The candidate's research concerns methods for identifying the flow of information from one brain area to another based on neural spike trains. Two major complications are, first, the noisiness of spike trains as conveyors of information and, second, the large numbers of neurons that must be considered simultaneously. Statistical methods developed very recently, through research supported by this grant, suggest very promising approaches to reducing the effects of noise and grappling with large networks of neurons. Based on these ideas, the candidate will develop a PhD thesis topic, and pursue it, with support from this supplement. Description of R01 and Candidate's Project Because neural network dysfunction is widely considered to be associated with psychopathology, new recording and stimulation technologies have the potential to greatly accelerate mental health research, thereby improving dramatically the treatments offered to patients. Still, although there have been many important advances in mental health research and treatment, in no case is any mental health disorder well understood mechanistically. Faced with the reality that each promising discovery inevitably reveals new subtleties, a reasonable experimental goal is to be able to change behavior in desirable ways by modifying speciﬁc brain circuits [5, 8] and, in animals, technologies exist for circuit disruptions that are precise in both space and time [4, 7]. However, determining the best location and time for such disruptions to occur, with minimal off-target effects, requires far greater knowledge of circuits than currently exist: we need good characterizations of interactions among brain areas, including their timing relative to behavior. The over- arching aim of our research is to provide statistical methods for describing the ﬂow of information, based on evolving neural activity, among multiple areas of the brain during behavioral tasks. Neurophysiologists are starting to apply methods that can lead to breakthroughs, but the resulting data are complicated, and carefully-crafted statistical methods are needed. The research conducted under this grant over the past 18 years has helped lay the foundation for major advances through steady, systematic investigation of variability in neural signals and construction of new techniques. Our approach applies the knowledge accumulated in the discipline of statistics to the special circumstances of neurophysiology. The primary way neurons communicate is through rapid electrical discharges known as spikes, and se- quences of spikes are known as spike trains. A major focus of attention is the rate at which a neuron is ﬁring, and the way that rate varies with experimental conditions and behaviors. We and others have been trying to understand better the ﬁring rate ﬂuctuations among spike trains recorded simultaneously from many neurons, across multiple regions of the brain. Because each spike occurs over the course of roughly 1 mil- lisecond while behavior occurs over hundreds of milliseconds, it is reasonable to consider a spike train to be a stochastic sequence of isolated points in time which, in probability and statistics, is called a point process. Early theoretical research on point processes relied on an assumption of steady-state time-invariance, known as stationarity. Every behavioral setting, however, creates constantly-evolving neural activity. The origin of this grant in 2001 was our outline of a simple and tractable approach to neural spike train analysis that accommodates evolving, non-stationary activity. It has become a standard tool, and much of our research is based on similar point process statistical models except now, to describe complicated settings, they are much more elaborate. We also analyze and study local ﬁeld potentials (LFPs), which result from all the neural currents gener- ated near the electrode (roughly within 150-200 microns), involving large numbers of neurons [3, 6]. The response of an LFP to varying conditions is less discriminative than individual neurons, but its power (vari- ability) can reveal situations in which a neural population is active, and it has been shown to correlate substantially with the BOLD fMRI signal [11, 12]. LFPs are especially useful for studying the role of oscillating neural circuits. Oscillations appear during many cognitive tasks, and changes in power and os- cillatory coupling have been associated with cognitive impairment [2, 10, 14]. Some of our research has been investigating the sources of LFPs in the cerebral cortex which, using biophysically-informed models, can be inferred to originate in particular cortical layers, thereby supplying important additional detail about dynamics and function [1, 9, 13]. Our Speciﬁc Aim 1 concerns (a) a new, putatively more accurate method of attributing LFPs to cortical sources, which allows us to explore cross-area interactions in greater detail than previously possible, (b) 1 simultaneous analysis of large numbers of LFPs, including those coming from two or more brain areas, and (c) identiﬁcation of oscillatory interactions from multiple brain areas. Speciﬁc Aim 2 concerns (a) simulta- neous analysis of large numbers of spiking neurons, (b) identiﬁcation of cross-correlation among brain areas based on large numbers of spiking neurons within each area, and (c) methods for analysis of precisely-timed synchronous (or nearly synchronous) spiking events, possibly in conjunction with oscillatory signals that are apparent in LFPs. Speciﬁc Aim 3 concerns (a) the combined assessment of interactions that occur at multiple timescales, (b) methods for relating large numbers of LFPs, which evolve across time, to behavior, and (c) creation of a simulation system based on realistic ground-truth models to test our methods. The candidate to be supported by the requested supplement, Tolani Olarinre, is now starting his third year in the joint Machine Learning and Statistics PhD program. We anticipate his ﬁnishing in 3 years, i.e., August 2024. Olarinre's research falls under our Speciﬁc Aim 2 (parts 2A and 2B), which concerns coordinated activity of spiking neurons across brain regions. When information appears to ﬂow from one brain region to another, the time lag may be short, under 10 milliseconds. One way to track ﬂow of information is to look for trial- to-trial variations, and see whether they tend to be consistent across regions. There are simple ways to try to do this, but it turns out they don't work: individual neural spike trains behave much like the simplest point processes, Poisson processes (they are different, but similar), with the consequence that the precise spike timing is unpredictable and, as a result, spike trains provide very noisy representations of evolving neural ﬁring rates. One important component of our research has been to devise methods for reducing the effects of this Poisson-like noise. For example, if two brain regions are coordinated, when activity in one region occurs earlier than average, activity in the other region should tend to occur earlier than average. Olarinre has been working with another graduate student and, based on their work, we have documented the failure of simple methods for identifying this kind of information ﬂow. On the other hand, sophisticated statistical methods succeed in ﬁnding it. We expect to submit a manuscript for publication within the next few months. A major complexity involves the large numbers of neurons recorded within a region, and the possible in- teractions they may have among themselves. A now-standard way to identify such interactions, based on point process statistical modeling, is to put into the model “coupling” terms to measure the inﬂuence of one neuron on another. A former student, Neil Spencer, who recently defended his PhD under Kass's super- vision, has developed very interesting computationally-efﬁcient methods for examining these interactions using network models. We have realized, however, that models with standard coupling terms suffer from the curse of Poisson-like noise. Thus, to be maximally effective they need to be modiﬁed. In outline we know what modiﬁcations to make, but devising a good algorithm and implementation will be challenging. This is a main part of the project Olarinre will next take up and, because novel method and implementation development of this kind requires a lot of time, it will most likely take him through 2022, so that during the Spring semester of 2023 he will be able to propose a thesis topic that includes network models and applies them to key problems. Spencer has acquired world-level expertise in cutting-edge Bayesian computation and he has agreed to collaborate with Olarinre by suggesting approaches, and modiﬁcations when the need arises, which will be very helpful. A letter from Dr. Spencer is provided with this application. In Olarinre's detailed work to date, he has found a wide diversity of neural responses within small regions of cortex. One of the problems he plans to investigate is the role of distinguishable subclasses of neurons. This would require, ﬁrst, methods of deﬁning these subclasses based on physiology (spiking patters), with consideration of anatomical location (cortical layer). Other key problems are to describe the role of thalamic 2 input, and the variability of network behavior across animals. The latter problem will require development of additional new, computationally-intensive methods. The methods Tolani develops should provide new insights into brain network activity. His thesis will likely include contributions to all of these problems, and will thereby yield far more speciﬁc descriptions than currently exist of the way neurons in a particular brain region interact in order to ”package” the information that gets communicated. Mentoring Experience of PI The PI, Kass, has extensive experience mentoring trainees. Within the Department of Statistics he served as graduate advisor before becoming Department Head, a position he held for 9 years. He was involved in a series of 4 NSF training grants (and was PI on 3), across 17 years, all of which had mentoring as a major component. In those capacities he created, supervised, and participated in both group and individual mentoring programs. Kass subsequently served for 3 years as Interim Head of the department-like structure now called the Neuroscience Institute at Carnegie Mellon (CMU), and was concurrently the interim CMU- side Co-Director of the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC), which is an umbrella organization run jointly by CMU and the University of Pittsburgh. In that role he supervised graduate training in the very large non-degree program (just under 150 students enrolled, steady-state), which supplements disciplinary PhD training as a certiﬁcated add-on. During Kass's time as Department Head in Statistics he visited Morehouse College in an attempt to ﬁnd ways Carnegie Mellon could be helpful in supplementing the training of students from HBCUs. Out of that came a very successful summer program in basic statistics for those students interested in public health. From 2001 to 2007 we trained 33 students from 19 institutions. Many have gone on to very successful careers including advanced degrees, and we would like to think they were served well by being able to analyze and interpret data with conﬁdence (one became President of the Eastern North America branch of the Biometric Society). Kass has also been PI of an NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research training grant in computational neuro- science, which is now commencing its 15th year. Our version of the NIH Blueprint training in computational neuroscience has had an important additional component, a 10-week summer program for undergraduates, typically rising seniors. The program is not aimed primarily at URMs, but we have tried to recruit them during a selective admissions process. Over the past 8 years we trained 18 URM students (just under 25% of the total). The training begins with 2 weeks of background lectures together with supervised computational labs, and this is followed by 8 weeks of research as a member of a faculty lab group. Our goal has been to give these students the kind of exciting and productive research experience that would encourage them to apply to graduate school in areas related to computational neuroscience, while also getting them better pre- pared to do so. The program has been run by a faculty member devoted to this project (for summer support); Kass has served not only as the PI of the program but also as an active participant, delivering lectures and supervising 1 or 2 undergraduate trainees himself each summer. Training and Career Development Plan Primary Mentoring Having gotten to know Olarinre over these past 2.5 years, Kass is aware of his unusual strengths and also the challenges he faces. Olarinre now has good training in graduate level statistics and machine learning. He also has an unusually strong background in software engineering (having worked at Intel for 5 years). There are, however, occasional holes in his background, and his progress is somewhat slower than many other students here (Carnegie Mellon attracts its share of the very top students in statistics and machine learning internationally). As a consequence, in addition to weekly group meetings that Kass 3 and Olarinre will attend, (i) Kass will meet with Olarinre, individually, at least once a week, and sometimes more often, (ii) Kass's review of Olarinre's progress will be continual (i.e., at least weekly), (iii) Kass will not assume Olarinre has absorbed aspects of research and professional development unless they have been assessed, and (iv) Kass and Olarinre will have frequent discussions about future publication plans, presentation plans, and PhD program milestone plans; from time to time they will also talk about career goals, and strategies for achieving them. Research Methods As we said, Olarinre's courses have provided him the foundational theory and meth- ods for statistical machine learning (he will be ﬁnished with coursework at the end of this semester). Be- coming an effective researcher in this area requires, in addition, (a) detailed understanding of results from the neuroscience literature, and their experimental contexts; ( b) appreciation of aspects of data collection, including pre-processing steps, that might affect analysis and conclusions; (c) strong cross-disciplinary com- munication skills; (d) an ability to collaborate with other analysts, ranging from postdoctoral researchers to undergraduates; (e) the knowledge and willingness to “break” statistical models in order to evaluate their applicability to the problem at hand; (f) a clear appreciation of what statistical models can and can not accomplish; and (g) the ability to envision a uniﬁed analytical evaluation built from many different compo- nents, and to develop a convincing explanatory description of the work. These elements of research methods provide a checklist for Kass in assessing Olarinre's progress. Assessment comes from probing discussions during individual meetings, as well as the written summaries of work that Kass will require before each weekly meeting (described below). Instruction for Olarinre will come from feedback, but will be reinforced by general comments—not directed at speciﬁc individuals—in group meetings. In addition, component skills in research methods are apparent in oral presentations, writing for publication, and writing to meet the requirements of PhD program milestones. Individual meetings with Kass Olarinre will present his work in a structured form. Prior to each meeting, Olarinre will send to Kass a short document that contains key ﬁgures and equations, together with very concise explanations and conclusions; it will also include any concerns and queries he might have, and his thoughts on next steps, mainly for the following week. All points of summary and interpretation will have to be presented as whole-sentence bullet points, and all ﬁgures must have detailed captions to make them largely self-contained. Kass has found the whole-sentence bullet points, especially, to be an extremely useful device for trainees: it forces them to articulate a series of ideas that express, conceptually, their key ﬁndings and observations. This special format has challenged Olarinre, as it does many students—it's easy to avoid following the format when rushed, but the beneﬁts are improved communication, together with development of a skill that will serve him well for future oral and written presentations. By including next steps, in writing, he will habituate his planning process. As he reviews the previous week's plans together with their current week's results, Olarinre will gain conﬁdence in his progress. Furthermore, such documents can grow relatively easily into manuscripts. Kass emphasizes the importance of writing, and will guide Olarinre toward clarifying the structure and style of his written work, in conjunction with improving its substance. Mentoring topics and timeline In addition to the speciﬁcs of research, and its presentation, the mentoring that Kass will provide to Olarinre will include multiple topics. We have structured these again in a kind of check-list format (like the multiple aspects of research methods) and, in addition, have laid out a detailed timeline for them, in tabular form. The topics are explained brieﬂy, following the table itself. 4  21 Su 21 F 22 S 22 Su 22 F 23 S 23 Su 23 F 24 S 24 Su Milestones X X X Publications X X X X  Meetings X X X X  Teaching X X  Writing Skills X X X X X X  Presentation Skills X X X X X X X X X X Grant Writing X X  Reviewing X X  Time Management X X X X  Ethics X X X  Jobs X X X  Meet with Brown X X  Program milestones: These include ﬁnishing, presenting, and writing up an Advanced Data Analysis project in Fall 2021, the thesis proposal, in the summer of 2023; and the thesis defense in the summer of 2024. The Advanced Data Analysis project must involve a major cross-disciplinary effort (at least 12 months) and Olarinre must have an external co-advisor in addition to Kass. Olarinre's research has been done in collaboration with Dr. Joshua Siegle at the Allen Brain Institute. Dr. Siegle provided a letter of collaboration for the most recent grant application submission, and he will serve as formal co-advisor. Pub- lications: We anticipate 3 publications from the thesis, with the ﬁrst being based on the Advanced Data Analysis project; initial work on the ﬁrst paper will begin by the end of this summer, after which Olarinre will focus entirely on ﬁnishing the research and presenting it, with the paper being completed and submitted during Spring 2022. Work on the second paper will occur in conjunction with the thesis proposal in Spring 2023, while the third paper will be written in time for its incorporation into the thesis itself, in Spring 2024. Meetings: Olarinre will attend and present results at multiple meetings, including the 2022 international meeting on Statistical Analysis of Neural Data (SAND10), the 2023 meeting on computational and systems neuroscience (COSYNE), and the 2023 Joint Statistical Meeting. This latter is the largest statistical meeting in the world, and one of the best opportunities for networking. At all of these meetings Kass will make sure Olarinre is “plugged in,” by introducing him to researchers at different levels of seniority who share his interests. In 2024 Olarinre will attend at least one additional meeting, possibly the annual meeting of the biometric society (ENAR) during the Spring. Teaching: Large undergraduate enrollments at institutions like CMU have made teaching assistants essential to delivery of most courses offered by departments like Statistics & Data Science. Since our ﬁrst NSF training grant in 1996, Kass has recognized a much broader importance of TAing and related experiences to the development of graduate students in statistics. One of the pillars in our understanding is the recognition that much the same skills are used when teaching as when communicating technical material to less technical collaborators. Thus, regardless of Olarinre's ultimate career path, he will be served well by understanding what makes teachers effective, and by guided practice. Olarinre will serve as TA during Fall 2022 and Fall 2023. (While he is TAing, Olarinre will not be supported by this supplement.) Because he is in the joint PhD program with Machine Learning, he is expected to serve as a TA for one of their courses and one of the courses offered by Statistics & Data Science. We are very fortunate to have here at CMU a leading center for teaching, the Eberly Center for Teaching Excellence, the director of which, who holds a PhD in cognitive psychology, Kass collaborated with extensively early in her career. The center is a national leader in the formulation of good practices for undergraduate teaching and is unusual in its explicit use, in its many programs and materials, of high-quality research in educational psychology. The Eberly Center offers a series of workshops for graduate students, which Olarinre will at- 5 tend. Writing Skills: In addition to what we have already said, the timeline indicates when attention will be focused on document production. Presentation Skills: This is continual, through group presentations. Kass will review slides and provide feedback during practice sessions for all milestones and professional meeting presentations. Grant writing: Kass will go over with the NeuroStats group the process of grant writing, and with Olarinre individually as preparation for his thesis proposal and for his postdoctoral job search. On these occasions Olarinre will produce a short mock grant proposal, including speciﬁc aims, that Kass and others will critique. Reviewing: Kass is frequently asked to review articles for publication in leading journals and almost always asks a trainee to serve as a co-reviewer. Olarinre will get the chance to review such articles on at least two occasions, planned for summer of 2022 and 2023, as those are times with minimal additional responsibilities for him. Kass will guide him through the process. This is also a general topic that comes up in our NeuroStats research group, so discussions there (with several faculty) will reinforce best practices. Time management: Kass will review with Olarinre his strategies and tactics for time management, especially when key deadlines are looming. Ethics: Kass will discuss ethical issues with Olarinre as they arise naturally during the interdisciplinary collaboration and publication process. In addition, formal sessions will occur in the NeuroStats group. Topics Kass plans to discuss, and has discussed with other groups previously, include individual responsibilities when working together as a team across se- niority levels; determining authorship; plagiarism and acknowledgment of previous work; responsibility to publish; redundancy or duplication of publications; integrity in reporting statistical results; careful attention to statistical assumptions; making data and code available; intellectual property involving novel methodol- ogy; accuracy, acknowledgment of previous results, and responsibility to educate during oral presentations; conﬁdentiality and impartiality in reviewing the work of others; honest representation of work, accuracy of budgets, and responsible use of funds in grant proposals; types of scientiﬁc misconduct; complexity of typ- ical scenarios; responsibility and appropriate channels for reporting. Sessions are planned for each Spring, 2022, 2023, and 2024. Job hunting: Kass will ask several former trainees to discuss with the NeuroStats group their experiences, including types of jobs, interview preparation, honest representation of self, and the problem of assessing the multiple trade-offs among alternatives. These sessions are planned for each Fall, 2021, 2022, 2023. Kass will of course also discuss all of these topics with Olarinre when it is time for him to begin his search for his next position, presumably as a postdoctoral fellow. Additional Mentoring by Dr. Emery Brown Olarinre will be mentored primarily by Kass, with some supplementary mentoring by Dr. Emery Brown, at MIT. Brown has had a long-term collaboration with Kass (they wrote two highly-cited review papers on statistics in neurophysiology as well as an inﬂuential paper on graduate training in statistics). Brown is unusually accomplished: he is an MD-PhD, the only person to hold endowed chairs at both MIT and Harvard Medical School, a member of all 3 National Academies, and he is the 2020 winner of the Swartz Prize in Computational Neuroscience from the Society for Neu- roscience. Brown is deeply interested in the research topics Olarinre is pursuing and he is also himself an unusually successful mentor, including of trainees from under-represented groups. Dr. Brown, who is African-American, has also been very involved in diversity efforts at MIT and Harvard Medical School. The additional wisdom and advice Dr. Brown can offer Olarinre will be invaluable. A letter of collaboration for this special purpose is supplied with our application. Speciﬁcally, Brown has agreed to listen to Olarinre give a formal presentation, give him feedback, and discuss with him his goals and progress toward them. This will occur in Spring 2022, before Olarinre gives his ﬁrst presentation at the SAND10 meeting, and again in Summer 2023 in preparation for Olarinre's attendance and presentation at the Joint Statistical Meeting. At that time Brown will also talk to Olarinre about job search, which will be commencing. 6",Diversity supplement to Analysis of Nonstationary Point Process Data,10378845,R01MH064537,"['Academy ', '
