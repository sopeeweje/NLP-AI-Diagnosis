"14/22 Limited Competition for the Continuation of the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) Clinical Center Abnormal regulation of glycemia (“dysglycemia”) has a very long time course, from the earliest stage of pre-diabetes, to the onset of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), to the development of clinically detectable microvascular changes and measurable atherosclerosis, to clinically manifest complications with attendant morbidity and mortality. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) has explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention in the DPP cohort, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and has examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those with HbA1c ≥6.5%.  During the one-year extension of DPPOS Phase 3, we will maintain and continue to follow the well-characterized and valuable DPPOS cohort, and collect measurements of outcomes as described in the protocol. We will 1) perform new analyses to characterize the heterogeneous course of dysglycemia and its long-term complications and factors that define susceptibility or resistance to diabetes, its complications, and common chronic conditions of aging, and 2) explore the factors associated with participant retention, adherence to the protocol and completion of measurements, and determine if alternative methods can be implemented to improve retention and adherence and to expand data collection. These aims will provide important insights into prediabetes and diabetes and their long-term outcomes and could serve the potential further study of the DPPOS cohort. The DPPOS cohort is broadly representative of the current population with pre-diabetes and Type 2 diabetes (T2D), which affect >110,000,000 individuals in the U.S. with the total cost of diabetes currently estimated at $327 billion, and provides 24 years of information on their course and complications. Understanding the effects of preventing or delaying T2D on human disease, the potential long-term benefits of lifestyle intervention and metformin, one of the most commonly used medications in the world, and the clinical course of pre-diabetes and T2D is critical if we are to apply prevention and treatment methods effectively and efficiently. We will perform new analyses to characterize the heterogeneous course of dysglycemia and its long- term complications and factors that define susceptibility or resistance to diabetes, its complications, common chronic conditions of aging, and explore the factors associated with participant retention, adherence to the protocol and completion of measurements.",14/22 Limited Competition for the Continuation of the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) Clinical Center,10150284,U01DK048406,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Future ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' HbA1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' indexing ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Metformin ', ' Dimethylguanylguanidine ', ' N,N-dimethyl-imidodicarbonimidic diamide ', ' Dimethylbiguanidine ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Phenotype ', ' Placebos ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' sham therapy ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' socio-economic factors ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' physically handicapped ', ' physical disability ', ' physically disabled ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Genetic ', ' Prediabetes ', ' Prediabetic State ', ' pre-diabetes ', ' pre-diabetic ', ' prediabetic ', ' Prediabetes syndrome ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Outcome Study ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' Consult ', ' preference ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Regulation ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Adherence ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Diabetes prevention ', ' diabetes prevention program ', ' cost ', ' health economics ', ' clinical research site ', ' clinical site ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Mind ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' life style intervention ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' human disease ', ' intervention effect ', ' economic implication ', ' phase 3 study ', ' Phase III study ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' multimorbidity ', ' risk variant ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk allele ', ' risk gene ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk loci ', ' risk locus ', ' Microvascular Dysfunction ', ' microvascular complications ', ' microvascular disease ', ' small vessel disease ', ' cognitive disability ', ' treatment group ', ' data access ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' clinical development ', ' participant retention ', ' Infrastructure ', ' clinical center ', ' ']",NIDDK,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,U01,2021,26250,IN-07

"Using natural language processing to determine predictors of healthy diet and physical activity behavior change in ovarian cancer survivors ABSTRACT Cancer survivors are a growing population in the United States; more than 16 million currently live in the US and by 2030 this number is expected to exceed 22 million. It is estimated that more than 50 percent of new cancer cases could be eliminated through a combination of healthy behaviors (e.g., physical activity and healthy diet); and cancer survivors are at high risk for developing new and recurrent cancer. Unfortunately, a significant percentage of cancer survivors are not attaining the cancer preventive guidelines of healthy diet and physical activity. In the past few decades, a variety of telephone-based lifestyle interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in helping survivors meet cancer preventive guidelines, however these trials are labor intensive and expensive to deliver, limiting their potential for broad dissemination. We propose to address this hurdle by taking advantage of recent advances in artificial intelligence to reduce the cost and maximize the impact of these much-needed interventions. Machine learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) are analytical techniques that automatically learn from direct and indirect patterns in data. We propose to use machine learned algorithms to analyze speech to aid in predicting who may be at risk of poor adoption of healthy lifestyle behaviors. These speech data will come from the Lifestyle Intervention for Ovarian cancer Enhanced Survival (LIVES) study, a telephone-based lifestyle intervention testing whether a diet low in fat and high in vegetables, fruit, and fiber, coupled with increased physical activity will increase time to disease progression in 1200 ovarian cancer survivors who have recently completed treatment, as compared to an attention control. Intervention coaches employed motivational interviewing to elicit behavior change and all calls on the LIVES trial were recorded with repeat assessments of diet, physical activity, patient reported and clinical outcomes. We will use this existing and robust longitudinal data set, which pairs conversational speech data with explicit outcomes, to achieve the following objectives. 1) Develop a ML model to identify patterns in the interactions between coaches and their participants that signal a likelihood of optimal behavior change in diet and physical activity given the comprehensive LIVES data set, utilizing voice recorded calls, demographics, and clinical and patient reported outcomes collected at multiple time points. 2) Decompose the ML model in terms of “intervenable factors”, so that participant affect, coach adherence to the intervention protocol, and other important aspects of the interaction can be individually evaluated for their role in predicting behavior change, as well as adherence to intervention goals. This decomposition will directly enable early and targeted adjustments to intervention plans for individuals, reducing the cost and increasing the efficacy of intervention strategies. ML and NLP methods can produce models that listen to a coaching conversation and automatically predict whether it will result in positive change towards enactment of healthy lifestyle behaviors. Such predictive models would enable more efficient, effective, and individualized lifestyle interventions, the first step towards personalized behavioral medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study examines whether artificial intelligence can use speech and audio from health coaching calls to predict who is most likely to enact healthy lifestyle behaviors of diet and physical activity. This project uses previously collected data from the Lifestyle Intervention for Ovarian Cancer Enhanced Survival (LIVES) Study to 1) Develop a machine learning model to identify patterns in the interactions between coaches and their participants that signal a likelihood of optimal behavior change of healthy lifestyle and 2) Decompose the machine learning model in terms of “intervenable factors”, so that participant affect, coach adherence to fidelity protocols, and other important aspects of the interaction can be individually evaluated for their role in predicting healthy lifestyle behavior change and adherence to intervention goals.",Using natural language processing to determine predictors of healthy diet and physical activity behavior change in ovarian cancer survivors,10109452,R21CA256680,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' American Cancer Society ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Medicine ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Computers ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Fruit ', ' dietary fruit ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health education ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutes ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Methods ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' nutrition ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Measures ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Recommendation ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Speech ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Trial of Labor ', ' United States ', ' Vegetables ', ' dietary vegetable ', ' Voice ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Survivors ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Fiber ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Funding ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Dimensions ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Healthy diet ', ' balanced diet ', ' good diet ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' behavioral prediction ', ' behavior prediction ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' motivational interview ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer-directed therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' Provider ', ' Malignant Ovarian Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Ovarian Tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Ovary ', ' Ovary Cancer ', ' ovarian cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of ovary ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Recurrent Cancer ', ' Recurrent Malignant Tumor ', ' Recurrent Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' survive cancer ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' anticancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' life style intervention ', ' Coupled ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' healthy weight ', ' healthy lifestyle ', ' healthy life-style ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' attentional control ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' lifestyle data ', ' life-style data ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' behavioral adherence ', ' behavior adherence ', ' telephone coaching ', ' coaching calls ', ' telephone counseling ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R21,2021,209312,AZ-03
"Design and Evaluation of a Decision Support Engine for Advanced Treatment of Type 1 Diabetes Project Summary Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a disease characterized by pancreatic beta destruction with subsequent insulin depletion. The alterations in glucose dynamics are incredibly difficult to manage and are confounded by meals, exercise, menstruation, and stress. Although automated insulin delivery systems are becoming commercially available, the large majority of people with T1D are treated with multiple daily injections of insulin (MDI). Dangerous complications of hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis can occur from failure to dose insulin correctly, however vigilant adherence to tedious insulin dosing strategies are difficult for MDI users maintain. This difficulty is magnified during exercise, which is critical to ameliorating long-term complications of diabetes; even when guidelines for insulin dosage adjustments are followed, acute hypoglycemia during exercise and night-time hypoglycemia can occur. In our recent survey of 1400 subjects living with T1D, the majority of subjects on MDI therapy were not confident in managing their glucose during exercise and felt they lacked tools to do so. In aggregate, difficult treatment schedules and bolus calculations, associated acute complications from daily activities, and the emotional and psychological toll of this chronic disease can result in treatment non-adherence and poor glycemic outcomes. Therefore, there is a critical need for decision support tools designed for MDI users to improve glycemic control surrounding meals, daily activities and exercise. The goal of this proposal to develop a decision support tool for patients with type 1 diabetes who utilize continuous glucose monitoring systems and multiple daily injection therapy. This tool will be called miTREAT, the multiple injection treatment recommender system for exercise-aware therapies. We hypothesize that use of a novel decision support tool equipped with content-based collaborative filtering methods and dynamic exercise hypoglycemia prediction algorithms will improve overall euglycemia and reduce time spent in hypoglycemia for patients on MDI therapy. In our first aim, we will leverage decades of research in computer science recommender systems and machine learning optimization strategies to develop a novel decision support system that identifies issues in glycemic control and recommends appropriate insulin dose and behavioral modifications. In our second aim, we will develop a new exercise model that reflects both the dynamics of rapid-uptake of glucose through GLUT-4 channels and the longitudinal biphasic insulin sensitivity profile. This new model structure will be used to predict hypoglycemia during and after the exercise period. In our third aim, we will explore the performance of our decision support engine in an in-vivo clinical trial. This clinical trial will assess the usability of a new smart-phone app designed to assist MDI users that we have developed at OHSU. In achieving these goals, we will develop the first decision support system that provides treatment and behavioral recommendations to patients on CGM-augmented MDI therapy. This system will improve overall time in euglycemia, and reduce the occurrence of acute complications surrounding exercise. Project Narrative Type 1 Diabetes is difficult to manage through multiple daily injections, and there is a paucity of tools available to assist patients with treatment decisions. In this proposal, the fields of computer science, machine learning, constrained optimization and clinical science are united to develop a novel decision support tool for multiple daily injection users. This is accomplished in three parts: 1) we will tune a decision support system to correctly identify issues in patient glycemic control and recommend appropriate treatment modifications; 2) we will develop a new hypoglycemia prediction tool that reflects the longitudinal dynamics of glucose uptake during and after exercise; and 3) we will explore the performance of this decision support system and hypoglycemia prediction tool in a clinical trial.",Design and Evaluation of a Decision Support Engine for Advanced Treatment of Type 1 Diabetes,10126842,F31DK121436,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Aerobic Exercise ', ' Aerobic Activity ', ' Aerobic fitness ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Brittle Diabetes Mellitus ', ' IDDM ', ' Juvenile-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Sudden-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T1 DM ', ' T1 diabetes ', ' T1D ', ' T1DM ', ' Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 1 diabetes ', ' Type I Diabetes Mellitus ', ' insulin dependent diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes mellitus ', ' ketosis prone diabetes ', ' type I diabetes ', ' type one diabetes ', ' Diabetic Ketoacidosis ', ' Diabetic Acidosis ', ' Diabetic Ketosis ', ' diabetic ketoacidotic ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Exercise ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hypoglycemia ', ' hypoglycemic ', ' hypoglycemic episodes ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' injection therapy ', ' Insulin ', ' Humulin R ', ' Novolin R ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Menstruation ', ' Menses ', ' menstrual period ', ' monthly period ', ' Methods ', ' Structural Models ', ' Pancreas ', ' Pancreatic ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Recommendation ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Running ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Medical Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Weight ', ' Assimilations ', ' Mediating ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' human subject ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Evaluation ', ' Cutaneous ', ' Failure ', ' Trust ', ' Measurement ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' tool ', ' Diabetes Complications ', ' Diabetes-Related Complications ', ' Diabetic Complications ', ' Complications of Diabetes Mellitus ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Clampings ', ' Closure by clamp ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Infusion ', ' Infusion procedures ', ' Performance ', ' heuristics ', ' computer science ', ' glucose uptake ', ' novel ', ' Study Subject ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Decision Support Systems ', ' response ', ' glucometer ', ' glucose meter ', ' glucose monitor ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' insulin sensitivity ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Erythrocyte/Hepatoma Glucose Transporter ', ' GLUT ', ' GLUT1 ', ' Glucose Transporter 1 ', ' SLC2A1 ', ' Solute Carrier Family 2, Facilitated Glucose Transporter, Member 1 ', ' SLC2A1 gene ', ' Dose ', ' Adherence ', ' Bolus ', ' Bolus Infusion ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Exercise Physiology ', ' Modification ', ' Tracer ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' diabetes management ', ' diabetic management ', ' glycemic control ', ' glucose disposal ', ' insulin stimulated glucose disposal ', ' Outcome ', ' blood glucose regulation ', ' glucose control ', ' glucose homeostasis ', ' glucose regulation ', ' e-commerce ', ' ecommerce ', ' internet commerce ', ' usability ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' standard of care ', ' Regimen ', ' Cross-Over Trials ', ' Crossover Trials ', ' support tools ', ' exercise intensity ', ' resistance exercise ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' smartphone Application ', ' Android App ', ' Android Application ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smartphone App ', ' iOS app ', ' iOS application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iPhone Application ', ' Injections ', ' euglycemia ', ' in silico ', ' ']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,51036,OR-03
"Machine learning-based multi-omics modeling and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in elucidating molecular transducer of physical activity ABSTRACT Regular exercise (physical activity) is the most effective intervention that promotes health and combats non- communicable disease (NCD). However, our understanding of the molecule(s) responsible for the superb benefits of exercise is obscure. The NIH Common Fund project “Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC)” is a large-scale discovery study designed to understand the molecular responses to exercise training, which has released the first batch of multi-omics data, including RNA-seq, Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing, proteomics, phosphoproteomics, acetylproteomics, and targeted and untargeted metabolomics, from 5 tissues collected at different time points in rats following an acute bout of endurance exercise. These endeavors have laid a solid foundation for elucidation of the molecular transducer of physical activity. We have recently made significant progress in four areas, which poised us to explore these data and elucidate the mechanism(s) in an unprecedented manner. Specifically, 1) We have obtained similar time-course, transcriptomics data in 4 tissues in mice following acute and long-term endurance exercise and developed machine learning capability for mining the multi-omics data for identification of regulatory factors that mediate the exercise benefits; 2) We have perfected CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing for generation of loss- of-function knock-in mice as well as techniques to generate tissue-specific, inducible gain-of-function transgenic mice; 3) We have established comprehensive phenotypic analysis in mice; and 4) We have had a successful experience in elucidating the regulation and function of extracellular superoxide dismutase (EcSOD), a humoral factor expressed in skeletal muscle and promoted by endurance exercise, in mediating the health benefits and protection against diseases. We hypothesize that endurance exercise promotes expression and release of one or more humoral factors from one or multiple tissues/organs, which is sufficient and necessary mediating the health benefits of exercise. To this end, we propose 1) Identify candidate molecular transducers of physical activity by machine learning-based multi-omics modeling. 2) Generate loss-of-function knock-in and tissue-specific, gain-of-function transgenic mice using CRISPR/Cas9- mediated gene editing and transgenesis. 3) Elucidate the role of the candidate molecular transducers of physical activity in health benefits of exercise. The experimental design and model systems are both conceptually and technically innovative. The findings will significantly improve the mechanistic understanding of exercise-induced adaptations with great potential impact on the future development of therapeutics for NCD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Since ancient times, physical activity has been well-known to improve health and prevents disease, but the understanding of biological molecule(s) responsible for the health benefits is still obscure. We formed a multi- disciplinary team to employ computational machine learning to explore the multi-omics data obtained from MoTrPAC to identify the potential molecule(s) followed by the state-of-the-art gene editing in mice to elucidate how this molecule(s) could transduce the health benefits of physical activity.",Machine learning-based multi-omics modeling and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated

"Clinical, Radiologic and Biochemical Factors Related to Diabetes Development after Acute Pancreatitis Abstract Nearly 40% of patients develop diabetes after an initial episode of acute pancreatitis (AP). Various studies have evaluated risk factors for the development of diabetes but they have shown inconsistent findings, suggesting methodologic shortcomings. The present proposal consists of three specific aims where we will attempt to determine the biochemical, radiologic and clinical factors related to the development of diabetes after AP. Aim 1: To identify autoantibodies associated with the progression of type 1 diabetes in patients after AP using a large human proteome array. Aim 2: To study the role of imaging, more specifically quantitative textural analysis to predict the development of type 1 diabetes after AP. Aim 3 is to build a machine learning model to predict type 1 diabetes after AP using patient-related risk factors, textural analysis on imaging and autoantibodies involved in disease progression. Our proposal will help us better understand diabetes after AP. Successful completion of this study has the potential to improve management for AP. Project Narrative Relevance to Public Health Statement Acute pancreatitis is increasing in incidence and can lead to diabetes in some patients. Diabetes is a morbid disease. We plan to study both established and novel risk factors for developing diabetes in patients with acute pancreatitis.","Clinical, Radiologic and Biochemical Factors Related to Diabetes Development after Acute Pancreatitis",10264897,U01DK127400,"['acute pancreatitis ', ' Antibodies ', ' Autoantibodies ', ' autoimmune antibody ', ' autoreactive antibody ', ' self reactive antibody ', ' Autoantigens ', ' Autologous Antigens ', ' Self-Antigens ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune condition ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Autoimmune Responses ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Brittle Diabetes Mellitus ', ' IDDM ', ' Juvenile-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Sudden-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T1 DM ', ' T1 diabetes ', ' T1D ', ' T1DM ', ' Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 1 diabetes ', ' Type I Diabetes Mellitus ', ' insulin dependent diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes mellitus ', ' ketosis prone diabetes ', ' type I diabetes ', ' type one diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Future ', ' Glucagon ', ' Antidiabetic Hormone ', ' Glukagon ', ' HG-Factor ', ' Hyperglycemic-Glycogenolytic Factor ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypoglycemia ', ' hypoglycemic ', ' hypoglycemic episodes ', ' Incidence ', ' Insulin ', ' Humulin R ', ' Novolin R ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Pancreas ', ' Pancreatic ', ' Pancreatic Diseases ', ' Pancreatic Disorder ', ' pancreas disorder ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' Total Pancreatectomy ', ' pancreas total excision ', ' Autologous Transplantation ', ' Autograft ', ' Autotransplant ', ' autologous graft ', ' autotransplantation ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Serology ', ' Biochemical ', ' Autoimmune Diabetes ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Acute Necrotizing Pancreatitis ', ' pancreatitis necrotizing ', ' impaired glucose tolerance ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Prediabetes ', ' Prediabetic State ', ' pre-diabetes ', ' pre-diabetic ', ' prediabetic ', ' Prediabetes syndrome ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Visceral ', ' subdermal ', ' subcutaneous ', ' Texture ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' Biopsy Sample ', ' Biopsy Specimen ', ' novel ', ' Proteome ', ' Modeling ', ' Proteomics ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' model development ', ' Organ failure ', ' Insulin Cell ', ' Insulin Secreting Cell ', ' β-cell ', ' β-cells ', ' βCell ', ' Beta Cell ', ' Address ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical/Radiologic ', ' Collection ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' systematic review ', ' macrovascular disease ', ' macrovascular complication ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' islet ', ' Diabetes autoantibodies ', ' diabetic Autoantibodies ', ' Impairment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' clinical risk ', ' nutrient absorption ', ' biomarker identification ', ' marker identification ', ' radiomics ', ' radiological imaging ', ' radiologic imaging ', ' Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome ', ' clinical center ', ' ']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,286563,MD-07
"Enabling Fully Automated Closed Loop Control in Type 1 Diabetes Through an Artificial Intelligence Meal Detection Algorithm and Pramlintide Summary People with type 1 diabetes (T1D) have autoimmune destruction of beta cells resulting in insufficient insulin to maintain normal glucose levels, thereby requiring exogenous insulin treatment, typically delivered subcutaneously either continuously infused through an insulin pump or by injection multiple times throughout the day. There are now commercial closed loop systems available that enable automated delivery of fast- acting insulin in response to wireless continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensors that inform an automated control algorithm to calculate and deliver insulin via a pump. Unfortunately, current commercial closed loop systems are hybrid systems that require users to announce meals to the system, and these hybrid systems do not control glucose well following meals. People oftentimes forget to announce their meals or misestimate their carbohydrate intake, thereby leading to poor overall postprandial glucose control. The primary benefit of hybrid closed loop systems has been during the overnight period when meals are not consumed. In a normal working beta cell, the hormone amylin is co-secreted with insulin in response to meals to help suppress glucagon production and delay gastric emptying, thereby reducing postprandial glucose increases. Pramlintide is an analog of the endogenous hormone amylin. Our commercial partner, Adocia, has developed a coformulation of insulin and pramlintide. In this project, we will develop a dual hormone (insulin and pramlintide), fully automated closed loop system with a meal detection algorithm that will enable substantial improvements in postprandial glycemic control for people with T1D while minimizing patient burden by not requiring a meal announcement to the system. Our group has previously developed a multi hormone closed loop system (insulin and glucagon) and we have developed models of insulin, pramlintide, glucagon, and carbohydrate kinetics and dynamics that will be integrated into a new insulin+pramlintide closed loop model predictive control (MPC) system (Aim 1). We have also developed a meal detection algorithm that will be integrated with this MPC control algorithm to dose insulin and pramlintide shortly after a meal is detected, thereby eliminating the need for the user to announce this meal to the system (Aim 1). We will use our in silico simulator of glucose metabolism to identify the optimal dosing amount and timing when insulin and pramlintide are delivered in response to the meal detection algorithm (Aim 1). Next, we will evaluate the optimal insulin and pramlintide dosing therapies identified in Aim 1 and evaluate the top 4 strategies during an in-clinic meal test in a 4-arm randomized crossover study in 14 people with T1D (Study 1a, Aim 2). We will then evaluate the optimal insulin and pramlintide dosing therapy identified in Study 1a and compare with various insulin-only hybrid and automated therapies in an in-clinic randomized crossover study (Study 1b, Aim2). Finally, in Aim 3, we will evaluate the optimal insulin and pramlintide dosing therapy determined in Aim 2 and compare it with the Tandem Diabetes Control-IQ commercial hybrid closed loop system. Narrative People with type 1 diabetes have difficulty managing their glucose levels, especially during the daytime in response to carbohydrate intake; persistently elevated glucose levels can lead to dangerous, poor overall health outcomes including retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy. We will develop a new dual hormone (insulin and pramlintide), fully automated closed loop system that can automatically detect meals and dose in response to these meals. By combining the slowed gastric emptying and suppression of endogenous glucose production that pramlintide provides with a meal detection algorithm, we expect to translate a fully automated closed loop system with minimal patient burden that can achieve substantial improvements in glycemic control both during the evening and during the day.",Enabling Fully Automated Closed Loop Control in Type 1 Diabetes Through an Artificial Intelligence Meal Detection Algorithm and Pramlintide,10276661,R01DK129382,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Carbohydrates ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Brittle Diabetes Mellitus ', ' IDDM ', ' Juvenile-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Sudden-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T1 DM ', ' T1 diabetes ', ' T1D ', ' T1DM ', ' Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 1 diabetes ', ' Type I Diabetes Mellitus ', ' insulin dependent diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes mellitus ', ' ketosis prone diabetes ', ' type I diabetes ', ' type one diabetes ', ' Engineering ', ' Exercise ', ' Gastric Emptying ', ' stomach emptying ', ' Glucagon ', ' Antidiabetic Hormone ', ' Glukagon ', ' HG-Factor ', ' Hyperglycemic-Glycogenolytic Factor ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hormones ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Hybrids ', ' Hypoglycemia ', ' hypoglycemic ', ' hypoglycemic episodes ', ' Inpatients ', ' Insulin ', ' Humulin R ', ' Novolin R ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Insulin Infusion Systems ', ' insulin pump ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Kinetics ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Nausea ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Production ', ' Publishing ', ' Retinal Diseases ', ' Retinal Disorder ', ' retina disease ', ' retina disorder ', ' retinopathy ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' islet amyloid polypeptide ', ' Insulinoma amyloid peptide ', ' amlintide ', ' amylin ', ' diabetes associated peptide ', ' insulinoma amyloid polypeptide ', ' pancreatic amylin ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Insulin, Aspart, Human ', ' B28Asp ', ' insulin B28Asp ', ' insulin aspart ', ' Cross-Over Studies ', ' Crossover Studies ', ' Gastroparesis ', ' Gastric Stasis ', ' delayed gastric emptying ', ' base ', ' Pump ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' analog ', ' carbohydrate metabolism ', ' Metabolic ', ' Area Under Curve ', ' Hour ', ' Clinic ', ' neuropathic ', ' Neuropathy ', ' subdermal ', ' subcutaneous ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Pramlintide ', ' glucose metabolism ', ' simulation ', ' Participant ', ' Modality ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' glucometer ', ' glucose meter ', ' glucose monitor ', ' Insulin Cell ', ' Insulin Secreting Cell ', ' β-cell ', ' β-cells ', ' βCell ', ' Beta Cell ', ' Dose ', ' Detection ', ' Intake ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' wireless ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' clinical efficacy ', ' glycemic control ', ' glucose production ', ' glucose RA ', ' glucose rate of appearance ', ' Outcome ', ' blood glucose regulation ', ' glucose control ', ' glucose homeostasis ', ' glucose regulation ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' FDA approved ', ' patient population ', ' primary outcome ', ' diabetes control ', ' arm ', ' safety and feasibility ', ' recruit ', ' Injections ', ' pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics ', ' PK/PD ', ' in silico ', ' virtual patient ', ' autoimmune pathogenesis ', ' autoimmune attack ', ' autoimmune destruction ', ' ']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,560513,OR-03
"Multivariable Artificial Pancreas System to Detect and Mitigate the Effects of Unannounced Physical Activities and Acute Psychological Stress IIT Project Summary/Abstract The objective of this proposal is to demonstrate a viable, functionally integrated multivariable artificial pancreas that will mitigate meal, physical activity and acute psychological stress challenges without any manual inputs to better regulate glucose levels of people with diabetes. The first generation of artificial pancreas (AP) systems, the hybrid closed-loop AP, collects data from continuous glucose monitoring devices and relies on manual user inputs for mitigating the effects of meals and physical activities. Acute psychological stress and many other physical activities besides planned exercise can affect blood glucose levels and cause challenges to maintaining euglycemia for people with type 1 diabetes. Various physical activities and acute psychological stress events affect the metabolism and sensitivity to insulin in different ways. Hence, their types, intensities and durations, and their individual and concurrent presence must be detected in order to determine the optimal insulin administration. The multivariable artificial pancreas approach provides a well-integrated and user-friendly technology with minimal burden on the user and mitigates the effects of unexpected physical activities and acute psychological stress inducements. Additionally, this technology would be safer by reducing the number and duration of hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events, compared to APs based exclusively on continuous glucose monitoring device data. Such multivariable AP systems can only be developed by using a sophisticated multivariable approach that uses real-time information from continuous glucose monitoring devices and physiological variables obtained from wearable devices worn in free-living daily life. IIT- Project Narrative The multivariable artificial pancreas provides a well-integrated and user-friendly technology with minimal burden on the user and mitigates the effects of unexpected physical activities and acute psychological stress inducements.

"The role of gut microbes and microbial derived metabolites in the development of type 2 diabetes in humans PROJECT SUMMARY Mounting evidence links the gut microbiome – the modifiable “second genome” consisting of trillions of diverse microbes that inhabit the human gut – with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in humans. Studies using fecal transplant in mice have raised the central hypothesis that changes of the gut microbiome and the biochemical by-products originated from these microbes may be key modulators of development of T2DM. To date, however, knowledge of the specific microbial species that drive the development of T2DM in humans remain very limited. Human studies of the gut microbiome in T2DM have largely been cross-sectional and confounded by reverse causality. Indeed, many of the gut microbiome changes observed in human T2DM have been found to be a consequence of the disease or treatments, including the medication metformin, rather than a cause of T2DM. In addition, the circulating metabolites derived from the gut microbes that contribute to the development of T2DM remain to be discovered. In this Early Stage Investigator NIH R01 application, we propose the largest prospective study of the role of gut microbiome in T2DM using a Finnish cohort of 6921 individuals with fecal and plasma samples collected in 2002 and over 15 years of subsequent clinical follow up. This proposed study brings together a diverse team with deep expertise in the human microbiome, mass-spectrometry based metabolomics, computational biology, statistical epidemiology, and diabetes pathobiology, to specifically address the key biological and clinical questions regarding the role of gut microbes and microbial derived metabolites in the development of incident T2DM in humans. PROJECT NARRATIVE The gut microbiome are key modulators of human health and disease. To date, we have a limited understanding of the specific gut microbes and microbial derived metabolites contributing to the development of type 2 diabetes. In this Early Stage Investigator NIH R01 application, we propose the largest prospective microbiome study on type 2 diabetes.

"Greater Los Angeles Clinical Center of the Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes and Pancreatic Cancer This is an application for renewal of Clinical Center designation of the Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes, and Pancreatic Cancer (CPDPC). The Greater Los Angeles Clinical Center has provided considerable leadership in the organization and progress of the CPDPC. Dr. Pandol serves as co-chair of the Steering Committee and Dr. Goodarzi co-chairs the Type 3c Working Group. We have excelled in recruitment and retention of participants in the cohort studies implemented through the CPDPC designed to elucidate the natural history and develop means of diagnosis, treatment and clinical management of chronic pancreatitis (CP) and its complications in children and adults, and to determine the pathogenic interrelationships of diabetes and pancreatic cancer and develop the means of early diagnosis and management of pancreatic cancer. In addition, we have been performing a number ancillary and associated studies to support the overall goals of CPDPC, including: 1. Epidemiologic studies defining risk factors for pancreatic cancer and the natural history of CP; 2. Determining that genetic susceptibility for type 2 diabetes is a strong risk factor for diabetes associated with CP; 3. Developing liquid biopsy assays for aiding in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and CP; 4. Investigating mechanisms of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer for rational pharmaceutical treatments; and 5. Conducting pilot clinical trials for treatment of recurrent acute and chronic pancreatitis. For the next phase of the CPDPC we are committed to the following Specific Aims: 1. Continue recruitment and retention of subjects in CPDPC cohort studies (PROCEED, INSPPIRE 2, NOD,  DETECT) in existing and additional study sites, as well as increase diversity in the study population. 2. Continue currently supported ancillary studies to further develop risk factor models combined with liquid  biopsy assays for early diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer, and advance mechanism-  based treatments and clinical trials for recurrent acute and chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. 3. Build models that combine clinical features with genetic susceptibility to allow the prediction of future  development of diabetes in patients with chronic pancreatitis. 4. Determine the role of pancreatic enzyme replacement in regulating glucose homeostasis in patients with  chronic pancreatitis and diabetes, with or without pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. 5. Use existing and annotated pre-diagnostic CT scans to develop artificial intelligence-based techniques for  highly sensitive and specific methods for CT-based early pancreatic cancer detection. Our Center involves Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, UCLA Medical Center, the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System and the University of Southern California/Los Angeles Public Health System with an organizational structure designed to expand recruitment into cohort studies of CPDPC with increased diversity and to facilitate our participation in ancillary studies. This is an application to renew the “Greater Los Angeles Clinical Center of the Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes, and Pancreatic Cancer,” which consists of an expert team well-qualified to carry out studies of the Consortium in Los Angeles County, the most populous and ethnically diverse county in the United States. We plan to adjust and expand our recruitment strategies for cohort studies of the Consortium to help meet national goals; we will also continue progress on a series of ancillary studies within the Consortium designed to detect and treat pancreatic diseases. In addition, we propose new studies to develop prediction models for diabetes in chronic pancreatitis, interrogate the role of digestive enzyme insufficiency in this form of diabetes, and develop novel imaging-based methods for early pancreatic cancer detection that will, in turn, decrease the morbidity of pancreatic cancer.","Greater Los Angeles Clinical Center of the Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes and Pancreatic Cancer",10252045,U01DK108314,"['acute pancreatitis ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' California ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutes ', ' Leadership ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Anjali Gopalan, MD, MSHP is a board-certified Internist at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) Oakland Medical Center and a Research Scientist I (equivalent to Assistant Professor) at the KPNC Division of Research (DOR). With the proposed K23 mentored career development award, Dr. Gopalan will gain the advanced training and expertise necessary to become an independent investigator who can develop and implement tailored interventions for patients with early-onset type 2 diabetes (EOT2D). By focusing on adults with EOT2D, she seeks to address the comparatively poor micro- and macrovascular outcomes in this population that may result partly from inadequate management of hyperglycemia and other cardiovascular disease risk factors. Dr. Gopalan’s research premise posits that it is particularly critical for newly diagnosed patients with EOT2D to achieve early disease control, since tighter glycemic control during the year following diagnosis confers long-lasting micro- and macrovascular benefits. In support of the premise, the Research Aims of this K23 are to: 1) use electronic health record [EHR] data to identify EOT2D patient subgroups at highest risk of inadequate early disease control, 2) identify barriers to and facilitators of initial EOT2D management, and 3) examine prospective associations between patient-reported factors (e.g., disease-related distress, health literacy) and inadequate early disease control. The proposed research will be supported by experienced mentors and advisors, as well as advanced training in the following areas: 1) the use of advanced statistical modeling, 2) qualitative data analysis to inform intervention development, 3) the role of social determinants in health, and 4) implementation science. KPNC and DOR are ideal environments for the proposed work. KPNC is an integrated learning healthcare delivery system with a diverse membership of 4.2 million people (>350,000 with diabetes). DOR has a long track record of effectively training early stage investigators and has well-established internal research programs and collaborative relationships with nearby institutions that provide the infrastructure needed for career development. This environment, along with the proposed Research and Training Plans and an outstanding mentorship team, will enable Dr. Gopalan to continue to build the skills and generate the foundational data needed to submit an R01-level proposal during the final years of the proposed award period. In this planned R01, Dr. Gopalan will refine and implement an intervention (with a design based on the results of the three K23 Research Aims) to improve early care for newly diagnosed EOT2D patients and evaluate its impact on early outcomes in this growing, high-risk population. In summary, the proposed K23 award will support the career development of Dr. Gopalan and is vital to her acquiring the skill set and expertise required to become a successful, independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at a younger age have higher rates of complications than those diagnosed later in life. Given the lasting benefit conferred by early disease control, the initial care provided to this growing, high-risk population is particularly crucial. With this proposed career development award, Dr. Gopalan will acquire the research skills necessary to identify patients at highest risk for inadequate early disease control, define barriers to initial disease management, and develop an intervention designed to improve the care of adults (ages 21-44) with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.",The initial care of younger adults with newly

"Southern California Clinical Center of the Type 1 Diabetes in Acute Pancreatitis Consortium This application describes a robust Southern California-based Clinical Center for participation in the Type 1 Diabetes in Acute Pancreatitis Consortium (T1DAPC). Proposed protocols address the metabolic mechanisms and the genetic, protein, and imaging signature of patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) and recurrent acute pancreatitis (RAP) who are at high risk for future development of diabetes. AP is the most common cause of pancreatogenic diabetes. While meta-analyses have revealed an incidence rate of 23% for diabetes arising after AP, they have not shed light on the type of diabetes that develops, which may comprise autoimmune or idiopathic type 1 diabetes (T1DM), type 2 diabetes (T2DM), or a unique diabetes pathobiology. A detailed understanding of diabetes developing after AP will yield great benefit by facilitating novel approaches to predict, prevent, and treat this form of diabetes. The following aims are proposed to address these goals:  Specific Aim 1. Recruit a cohort of non-diabetic patients with a recent episode of AP or RAP and prospectively characterize their islet autoimmunity and glucose/insulin homeostasis using the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test and mixed meal tolerance tests performed 1 month after hospital discharge, and at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, and yearly thereafter. The goals of this aim are to (a) determine the incidence of diabetes after AP, (b) identify the types of diabetes that develop after AP, (c) identify early metabolic trajectories associated with post-AP diabetes, (d) assemble the cohort that will be the platform for Aims 2-4.  Specific Aim 2. Evaluate genetic and protein risk factors for diabetes in patients with AP or RAP. This Aim will evaluate association of genetic risk scores for T1DM and T2DM with post AP diabetes. Thirteen candidate proteins, associated with post AP diabetes in preliminary studies, will be assessed for association with incident diabetes after AP, yielding a key set of proteins with utility not only in diabetes prediction but also targets for future preventive or therapeutic measures.  Specific Aim 3. Characterize the imaging phenotype that predicts development of diabetes after AP or RAP. Retrospective CT scans obtained during hospitalization for AP as well as CT and novel multiparametric MRI scans obtained 1 and 12 months afterward will undergo artificial intelligence analysis to identify the imaging biomarkers that signal diabetes risk.  Specific Aim 4. Develop a multi-factorial model to predict development of diabetes after AP or RAP. A wealth of data will be collected from Aims 1-3, which will be combined with clinical factors to build and validate (in independent datasets) an integrative predictive model of post AP diabetes. The goal is to create a model that can be used in clinical settings to identify those at highest risk, facilitating targeted measures to prevent diabetes.  This innovative research will be conducted by an experienced team of investigators in endocrinology, gastroenterology, imaging, physiology, and epidemiology to solve a problem of great public health significance. This is an application for the establishment of a Southern California Clinical Center to participate in the Type 1 Diabetes in Acute Pancreatitis Consortium, comprised of an expert team to carry out studies of the Consortium in Los Angeles County, the most populous and ethnically diverse county in the United States. Acute pancreatitis, one of the most frequent causes of hospitalization in the USA, greatly increases the risk of future development of diabetes, yet the type of diabetes is unclear. We propose studies to determine the metabolic mechanisms and the genetic, protein, and imaging signature of diabetes occurring after pancreatitis, which will provide the means to understand, prevent,

"DFU Clinical Research Unit Abstract Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a prevalent diabetes complications affecting up to 25% of patients and leading to ~80,000 Americans having non-traumatic amputations each year, with five-year mortality rates of up to 40%. Recent evidence suggests that non-traumatic lower extremity amputations are on the rise, after decades of decline, in spite of advances in targeted wound care products, establishment of interdisciplinary clinical and surgical teams, and improving diabetes medical care. Given the worldwide epidemic of diabetes, the burden associated with DFU are high, including high costs of $9 billion-$13 billion per year and besides those associated with high morbidity and mortality. Thus, the establishment of a Diabetic Foot Consortium comprised of experienced DFU Clinical Research Units (CRU) for reliable DFU biomarker discovery cannot be understated. The main objective of this proposal is to integrate the robust infrastructure at Michigan Medicine with our highly skilled clinical and translational team to establish a DFU CRU as a strong contender and contributor within the DFC network that will be uniquely poised to participate in all DFU biomarker discovery and related wound healing projects undertaken by the Consortium. Additional aims are to The aims are to : identify, recruit, and phenotype a broad spectrum of DFU participants from the large base of patients with these conditions who are currently being followed at Michigan Medicine, according to the Consortium requirements; implement standardized mechanisms and protocols for effective longitudinal sample collection and retention; and actively participate in the DFC intellectually and provide all available resources to develop and support clinical study protocols to validate DFU biomarkers, including complex quantifications of wound image features; single cell, genetic, molecular, metabolomics, and microbiome analyses; and assessing additive predictors of DFU healing beyond clinical markers alone using multi-modal approaches. The expected outcome of this work is that the Michigan Medicine DFU Clinical Center will be an integral part of the Consortia collaborative network, with a highly positive impact for the entire spectrum of biomarker discovery and future novel therapies projects. Narrative This project has major public health relevance because diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) remain one of the most common secondary complications of diabetes and are the leading cause of lower extremity amputation in the US. Current treatments are ineffective and given the recent surge in major lower extremity amputations in diabetic patients despite the previous decades of decline, identification of novel treatment avenues is of critical importance. The main objective of the Diabetic Foot Clinical Center at the University of Michigan is to use our robust infrastructure and highly skilled clinical and translational research team to generate a unique platform for investigating individual contributions to DFU wound healing from clinical samples, single cell genetic and molecular analyses from DFU samples, and image analyses.",DFU Clinical Research Unit,10377784,U01DK119083,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Amputation ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clinical Markers ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Data Collection ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health delivery systems ', ' health services delivery ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Sterile coverings ', ' Dressing ', ' Engineering ', ' Epidemic ', ' Future ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Infection ', ' Institutes ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' male ', ' Marketing ', ' Medicine ', ' Methodology ', ' Michigan ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Measures ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Peripheral Nervous System Diseases ', ' PNS Diseases ', ' Peripheral Nerve Diseases ', ' Peripheral Nervous System Disorders ', ' Peripheral Neuropathy ', ' Phenotype ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Publishing ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Ulcer ', ' Ulceration ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' wound healing ', ' Wound Repair ', ' wound resolution ', ' Gender ', ' Walking ', ' Foot Ulcer ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Diabetic Foot ', ' Charcot foot ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' participant recruitment ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Diabetes Complications ', ' Diabetes-Related Complications ', ' Diabetic Complications ', ' Complications of Diabetes Mellitus ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cognitive function ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Location ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Devices ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Address ', ' diabetic foot wound ', ' Diabetic Foot Ulcer ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Analysis ', ' Collection ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Molecular ', ' Behavioral ', ' Peripheral arterial disease ', ' peripheral artery disease ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' microbiome ', ' cost ', ' healing ', ' clinical research site ', ' clinical site ', ' Outcome ', ' wound ', ' tissue wound ', ' wounding ', ' wounds ', ' prospective ', ' transcriptomics ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' public health relevance ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' FDA approved ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' diabetic patient ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' biomarker discovery ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' ineffective therapies ', ' ineffective treatment ', ' recruit ', ' practice setting ', ' microbiome analysis ', ' analyze microbiome ', ' Infrastructure ', ' wound care ', ' wound assessment ', ' wound monitoring ', ' clinical center ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2021,49505,MI-12
"Gamified Optimized Diabetes-management with AI powered Rural Telehealth (GODART) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Evidence-based guidelines for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) management aimed at glycemic control (reduced hemoglobin A1c) include a combination of diet, physical activity (PA), glucose monitoring, and medication adherences. However, the majority of individuals with T2DM are unable to follow these guidelines due to a lack of consistent health behavior counseling offered in the primary care setting. This problem is amplified in remote rural communities within the U.S. In response, this project aims to create an optimized telehealth-based intervention – Gamified Optimized Diabetes management with Artificial Intelligence–powered Rural Telehealth (GODART). GODART is grounded in the social cognitive theory and will serve as an automated behavior-monitoring and telecoaching platform. At the core, GODART is an automated conversational style behavior-monitoring system using natural language–understanding technologies. In this project, we propose to pilot and feasibility test the various components of GODART by leveraging multiphase optimization strategy (MOST). MOST is an efficient and rigorous resource-management and continuous- improvement framework for developing optimized interventions. Our proposal focuses on the MOST preparatory phase and will use a full factorial experimentation. We will pilot and assess the feasibility of and evaluate two different intervention components, with two levels in each of the groups, yielding four experimental conditions. These groups will test the effect of (i) a fixed vs. adaptive (gamified) rewards program and (ii) automated vs. human-delivered weekly health coaching. We will end the project with exit interviews conducted with a subset of participants.

"Handheld retinal camera for AI-based diabetic retinopathy screening PROJECT SUMMARY The CDC recommends that each of the 34.2 million patients with diabetes in the United States is screened annually for diabetic retinopathy (DR), a major cause of preventable blindness. Less than 50% of diabetes patients actually follow these guidelines due to lack of access to medical care and eye specialists, time and money constraints, and lack of symptoms with early-stage disease. To address these problems, our team at AI Optics is developing the world’s first artificial intelligence-based handheld retinal camera to allow for point-of-care DR screening. This device is designed to be portable, easy to use, and workflow friendly. It performs high-accuracy DR screenings on non-dilated patients, maintaining optimal security and remaining resilient to connectivity issues. Our goal is that this novel diagnostic device will expand DR screenings beyond the offices of eye specialists and into primary care, optometry offices, diabetes clinics, and retail health settings. This increased access to screening will increase early-stage diagnosis rates and avoid preventable vision loss. In this Phase I SBIR project, we will develop a retinal camera that complies with ISO 10940:2009 standards, which will be able to capture high-quality fundus images in a handheld device. To ensure that full-scale image classification can be conducted, we will also utilize our proprietary, deep-learning artificial intelligence system. Finally, we will ensure that images captured from our retinal camera can be analyzed by our artificial intelligence for the presence of DR. The successful completion of this project will result in an improved and more accessible tool for DR screenings that could lead to earlier DR diagnosis, blindness prevention, and significant cost savings for millions of people with diabetes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Less than 50% of the 34.2 million people with diabetes in the United States follow CDC guidelines to get annual screenings for diabetic retinopathy (DR), a leading cause of blindness that impacts up to 40% of diabetic patients. To address this problem, we propose the development of the world’s first handheld retinal camera that uses artificial intelligence for point-of-care DR screenings in primary care, urgent care, and retail health settings. As it can be operated without an eye specialist or Internet access, this handheld device will be portable, easy to use, and workflow friendly, enabling more screenings, earlier DR diagnosis, vision-loss prevention and significant cost savings for millions.",Handheld retinal camera for AI-based diabetic retinopathy screening,10324087,R43EY032822,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Blood Glucose ', ' Blood Sugar ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Diabetic Retinopathy ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Housing ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Persons ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Optometry ', ' Optometries ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Retina ', ' retina blood vessel structure ', ' Retinal Blood Vessels ', ' Retinal Vessels ', ' Running ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Measures ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Left ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' retinal damage ', ' damage to retina ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Ophthalmologist ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Phase II Clinical Trials ', ' Phase 2 Clinical Trials ', ' phase II protocol ', ' Point-of-Care Systems ', ' tool ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' success ', ' HIPAA ', ' Kennedy Kassebaum Act ', ' PL 104-191 ', ' PL104-191 ', ' Public Law 104-191 ', ' United States Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ', ' Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' Modeling ', ' handheld device ', ' handheld equipment ', ' portability ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Security ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' point of care ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' Network-based ', ' graphical user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' software user interface ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' diabetic patient ', ' product development ', ' Secure ', ' screening ', ' urgent care ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' cloud computer ', ' routine screening ', ' annual screening ', ' fundus imaging ', ' retinal imaging ', ' retina imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' screening services ', ' ']",NEI,AI OPTICS INC.,R43,2021,299219,NY-12
"10/22 Limited Competition for the Continuation of the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) - Clinical Center Abnormal regulation of glycemia (“dysglycemia”) has a very long time course, from the earliest stage of pre-diabetes, to the onset of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), to the development of clinically detectable microvascular changes and measurable atherosclerosis, to clinically manifest complications with attendant morbidity and mortality. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) has explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention in the DPP cohort, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and has examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those with HbA1c ≥6.5%.  During the one-year extension of DPPOS Phase 3, we will maintain and continue to follow the well-characterized and valuable DPPOS cohort, and collect measurements of outcomes as described in the protocol. We will 1) perform new analyses to characterize the heterogeneous course of dysglycemia and its long-term complications and factors that define susceptibility or resistance to diabetes, its complications, and common chronic conditions of aging, and 2) explore the factors associated with participant retention, adherence to the protocol and completion of measurements, and determine if alternative methods can be implemented to improve retention and adherence and to expand data collection. These aims will provide important insights into prediabetes and diabetes and their long-term outcomes and could serve the potential further study of the DPPOS cohort. The DPPOS cohort is broadly representative of the current population with pre-diabetes and Type 2 diabetes (T2D), which affect >110,000,000 individuals in the U.S. with the total cost of diabetes currently estimated at $327 billion, and provides 24 years of information on their course and complications. Understanding the effects of preventing or delaying T2D on human disease, the potential long-term benefits of lifestyle intervention and metformin, one of the most commonly used medications in the world, and the clinical course of pre-diabetes and T2D is critical if we are to apply prevention and treatment methods effectively and efficiently.

"The Role of Impaired Physical Function during Midlife on Predicting future ADRD Project Summary To reduce the increasing societal and financial burden of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), prevention is critical. Even small improvements of the modifiable dementia risk factors on the individual level have the potential to lead to a substantial reduction of dementia cases at the population level. The disease processes occur for years though symptoms typically appear after age 60. Thus, identifying those at risk early for intervention is crucial. Studies among adults aged 60 years and older have identified performance-based measures of impairment in physical function as early indicators of ADRD, three or more years prior to onset. To improve earlier prediction of ADRD, we need research on adults aged 51-59 years to assess the relationship between physical functional impairment and likelihood of ADRD onset years later. Further, given the burden of administering performance-based measures of physical function, it would be advantageous to use patient- reported metrics of limitation in physical function for ADRD prediction. We propose using the 1998-2018 nationally representative Health and Retirement Study (HRS) of adults aged 51-59 years to determine the extent to which patient-reported measures of function would facilitate efficient ADRD risk identification. Primary study aims are to: 1) To identify the extent to which self-reported measures of physical function in midlife predict future late-onset ADRD. We will use standardized (RAND HRS) self-reported measures of function and the Langa-Weir ADRD algorithm available in the HRS. Working hypothesis: Limitations in physical function, defined using summary measures of self-reported physical function predict onset of ADRD 4 to 20 years later. 2) Verify that sub-groups of adults, defined by limitations in physical function, aged 51-59 are at higher risk of developing ADRD. We will verify existence of sub-groups (identified in our preliminary analyses) using a computational systems approach (cluster analysis) are predictive of onset of ADRD through 2018, in adjusted analyses. Working hypothesis: Sub-groups of middle-aged adults with unique patterns of limitations in physical function are at higher risk of developing ADRD than those without physical functional deficit 4 to 20 years later, independent of related factors. This proposal addresses the objectives of PAS-19-391 in several ways. First, the Principal investigator (PI), an early stage investigator, is committed to a career in ADRD research. Second, the investigative team has training in non-neurological medical fields and will shift their research focus to ADRD prevention within their fields. Third, the PI has experience with an existing dataset (HRS); and will use it to assess age-related changes in non-cognitive processes that may be early signs of ADRD. Finally, the PI published an HRS study reporting that physical functional decline precedes the onset of diabetes, a risk factor for ADRD. Our proposal builds on this work. The successful completion of the proposed study will ascertain the extent to which self-reported impairment in physical function during midlife, predicts future ADRD, thereby offering a new, efficient mechanism for early identification of ADRD. Project Narrative  The proposed research is relevant to public health because the number of people living with dementia is expected to triple worldwide by 2050 unless effective measures to treat or delay the onset of the disease are implemented.1 The same study found that about 35% of ADRD could be delayed or prevented through modifiable health and lifestyle factors from different phases of life. To identify adults at risk of ADRD early, our study among adults aged 51-59 seeks to determine the extent to which self-reported measures of physical function are early indicators of ADRD and to identify sub-groups of people with unique patterns of limitation in physical function that are early indicators of ADRD.",The Role of Impaired Physical Function during Midlife on Predicting future ADRD,10106121,R03AG070668,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Cognition ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' Motor Activity ', ' Locomotor Activity ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Measures ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Standardization ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' grasp ', ' Grips ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Cerebrum ', ' cerebral ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Onset of illness ', ' disease onset ', ' disorder onset ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' late onset alzheimer ', ' Late Onset Alzheimer Disease ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Physical Function ', ' experience ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Subjects Selections ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' lifestyle factors ', ' life-style factor ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' functional decline ', ' decline in function ', ' decline in functional status ', ' functional status decline ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Impairment ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' Prevention trial ', ' Genetic study ', ' Preventive measure ', ' Preventative measure ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' dementia risk ', ' risk factor for dementia ', ' risk for dementia ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' financial burden ', ' financial distress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial stress ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' performance based measurement ', ' performance based measures ', ' ']",NIA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R03,2021,287889,RI-01
"Image Analysis and Machine Learning Methods for Biomarkers of Age-related and Metabolic Diseases Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Makrogiannis, Sokratis, Ph.D. Abstract Age-related and metabolic diseases such as type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and sarcopenia have become a worldwide epidemic that affects the quality of life of millions. To give a global perspective, roughly 343.8 million people in the world have type-2 diabetes today, and 175 million do not know they have diabetes at all. Metabolic diseases, such as diabetes and osteoporosis, are strongly linked to longitudinal changes in body composition, morphology and function.  Modern medical imaging technologies offer the opportunity to study the composition and morphometry of human body in ways that were previously impossible. Contemporary imaging studies that are performed in vivo on a large number of participants have enabled cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of age-related and metabolic diseases, and effects of pharmacological interventions. The emergence of advanced imaging technologies has also created the need for automated image analysis techniques for identification and quantification of morphological patterns of anatomies and tissues and their changes with increasing age.  This project will contribute novel and non-invasive medical image analysis techniques for studying the human body composition to achieve timely prognosis of these pathologies. Our research interests will concentrate on identification of morphological patterns in the mid-thigh, abdomen and lower leg that will eventually lead to development of imaging biomarkers. The accumulation of adipose tissue in the human body and changes of its regional distribution are associated with type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and the metabolic syndrome. Age-related changes in skeletal muscle composition are strongly linked to loss in muscle strength and mass, frequently termed as sarcopenia, leading to decreased mobility and function. Also, trabecular bone structural changes are associated with osteoporosis. We will use imaging and clinical data collected by the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) that is the longest ongoing epidemiology study in the US.  This work will address a technical and a clinical hypothesis. The technical hypothesis is that quantitative image analysis can accurately and robustly segment, register and fuse body composition data acquired by modern MRI and CT imaging scanners. The clinical hypothesis is that qualitative body composition phenotypes on clinical imaging can be used as biomarkers for prognosis and diagnosis of the metabolic syndrome manifestations. We will build on recent advances in medical image analysis to contribute novel and non-invasive techniques for studying the human body composition and its longitudinal changes with main applications in tissue identification and quantification at the mid-thigh, lower leg and the abdomen (aim 1). Then we will develop statistical machine learning methods to achieve timely diagnosis and prognosis of metabolic and age-related conditions including the metabolic syndrome and osteoporosis, and to track the effect of interventions (aim 2).

"The Ohio State University Chronic Pancreatitis Diabetes Pancreas Cancer (CPDPC) Clinical Center ABSTRACT The mechanistic underpinnings of diseases involving the exocrine pancreas are poorly understood. Chronic pancreatitis is often accompanied by inflammation of the pancreas, irreversible fibrosis, and destruction of the pancreatic parenchyma resulting in abdominal pain, malnutrition, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, pancreatogenic diabetes, and, in some cases, pancreas cancer. We have developed a network of adult and pediatric investigators to form The Ohio State University Clinical Center (OSU CC). In a multidisciplinary collaboration with other clinical centers in the Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes, and Pancreatic Cancer Clinical Centers (CPDPC-CCs) (U01), the OSU CC has helped develop four (4) major observational studies during the initial funding cycle to address research gaps in our understanding of diseases of the exocrine pancreas. Specifically, the OSU CC seeks to validate proposed diagnostic biomarkers in chronic pancreatitis, pancreatogenic diabetes, and pancreas cancer.

"Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Cancer Incidence in Women Abstract In the United States in 2016, an estimated 600,000 people will die from cancer and 1.7 million new cases of cancer will be diagnosed. Considering the life span, almost 40% of women and men will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lifetime. Understanding amenable risk factors that contribute to this large public health burden is essential. Observational studies consistently indicate associations between self-reported physical activity and increased risk of many types of cancer, especially breast cancer. However, there is insufficient evidence regarding the amount, intensity, duration, and types of physical activity required to reduce cancer risk, especially for older women. Sedentary behavior may provide a more feasible intervention target, especially for older adults. However, even less is known about sedentary behavior and cancer risk. To date, no prospective studies have examined accelerometry-derived physical activity and sedentary behavior to risk of incident cancer outcomes. Advances have been made in new measurement methods by our team, but have not been applied to health outcomes to assess their value. In this application, we propose to assemble accelerometry-assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior and cancer incident events and deaths from two cohort studies of women: the Women's Health Study (WHS) and the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Study. We will apply sophisticated, yet directly interpretable, methods to determine which physical activity and sedentary behavior features are most important for reducing cancer risk among more than 22,000 women 63 to 101 years of age. For both cohorts, one-week of accelerometry data were collected in a similar manner during 2011-2014. Follow-up of both cohorts for adjudicated cancer outcomes is planned through 2020 and likely beyond. We propose three aims. Aim 1 will apply novel and translational measures of accelerometry- assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior using latent class analysis, an activity index, and machine learning algorithms of raw accelerometry data for use in Aims 2 and 3. We will then investigate the association of accelerometry-assessed physical activity (Aim 2) and sedentary behavior (Aim 3) to overall and site-specific (e.g., breast, uterine, ovarian) incident and fatal cancer. This cost-efficient study will investigate in detail whether and how patterns of frequency, duration, intensity, bouts, and type of physical activity and sedentary behavior predict cancer outcomes. Identification of new cancer-protective patterns of physical activity and sedentary behavior will provide much-needed evidence to inform physical activity and sedentary behavior guidelines for disease prevention, can be used in interventions to reduce risk, and could revolutionize the monitoring of human responses in physical activity and sedentary behavior interventions. Project Narrative We will develop novel exposure metrics to determine the association of accelerometry-assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior to overall and site-specific incident and fatal cancer. This cost efficient project will provide much-needed evidence to inform physical activity and sedentary behavior guidelines for disease prevention in older women. Our findings can be applied to intervention studies to reduce risk. The exposure developments made from this project could revolutionize the monitoring of human responses to physical activity and sedentary behavior.","Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Cancer Incidence in Women",10246990,R01CA227122,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' disease of the lung ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Uterus ', ' womb ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' Leisures ', ' Guidelines ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Cervical ', ' Ovarian ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' sedentary ', ' Physical activity ', ' insight ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Measurement ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' age group ', ' cancer risk ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' Program Announcement ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Interruption ', ' Resolution ', ' Collection ', ' Light Exercise ', ' Light Activity ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Monitor ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' adjudicate ', ' Outcome ', ' cost efficient ', ' cancer type ', ' older women ', ' sedentary lifestyle ', ' Sedentary behavior ', ' Sedentary life-style ', ' Accelerometer ', ' accelerometry ', ' activity monitor ', ' activity tracker ', ' vigorous intensity ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' ']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,640965,NC-04
"Autonomous AI to mitigate disparities for diabetic retinopathy screening in youth during and after COVID-19 Project Summary  COVID-19 has led to disruptions and delays in routine pediatric care. For children with diabetes who see their diabetes team every 3 months, this has been reduced or transitioned to telemedicine due to COVID- 19. However, those without technology and internet capabilities, namely low income and minority youth, are less likely to participate in telemedicine and may see their diabetes team less frequently during the pandemic. Screening for diabetes complications, such as diabetic retinopathy (DR), is generally fulfilled by a separate visit to an eye-care professional (ECP), and is also less likely to occur during COVID-19.  Diabetic retinopathy affects 4-15% of youth with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and is a leading cause of blindness in adults as early as age 20. Yearly screening for DR is recommended, but only 35-72% of youth undergo screening, with minority youth and children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds less likely to undergo screening. Early detection of DR through screening prevents progression to vision loss. The current standard of care for pediatric DR screening is referral to an ECP for a dilated eye exam. Recently, the FDA approved the first autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) software that interprets retinal images taken with a non-mydriatic fundus camera, providing an immediate result for DR screening at the point of care (POC) for adults with diabetes. In a pilot study at our institution, we were the first to implement this technology in pediatrics, demonstrating safety, effectiveness and equity, and cost-savings to the patient. We also found that minority youth, those with lower household income and Medicaid insurance were less likely to undergo recommended screening, yet were more likely to have DR. This is likely to worsen due to the disparate effects of COVID-19.  We hypothesize that implementing POC autonomous AI in the diabetes care setting will increase DR screening rates in youth with diabetes, mitigate disparities in access to screening, and be cost-effective to the health care system now and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. In this proposal, we will first determine (Aim1) in a randomized control trial at two clinic sites if autonomous AI increases screening compared to ECP, and if those who screen positive by AI are more likely to go for follow-up at the ECP. In the second phase of this proposal (Aim2) we will perform a prospective observational trial of AI screening to determine if AI mitigates disparities in screening, and improves the proportion of at-risk, minority and low income, youth who go for follow-up if their AI screen is positive. In Aim 3, we will use a decision model to determine if AI is cost-effective and cost-savings to the health care system. If AI is shown to increase screening rates while mitigating disparities in access to care, it has the potential to reshape screening methods now and in the future. Project Narrative Diabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes for which children with type 1 and type 2 diabetes are recommended to obtain annual screening for diabetic retinopathy. However, adherence rates are suboptimal with only 50% of children obtaining the recommended screening, which is likely to worsen during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly for at-risk, minority and low-income, youth who have been disproportionately affected. In this proposal, we aim to implement a new and innovative technology in the diabetes care setting, using a non-mydriatic fundus camera with autonomous artificial intelligence to provide screening and results at the point of care as a means to improve screening rates, mitigate disparities in access to screening and determine cost-effectiveness to the health care system.",Autonomous AI to mitigate

"21/22 Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) Phase 3 - One Year Extension - Clinical Center Abnormal regulation of glycemia (“dysglycemia”) has a very long time course, from the earliest stage of pre-diabetes, to the onset of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), to the development of clinically detectable microvascular changes and measurable atherosclerosis, to clinically manifest complications with attendant morbidity and mortality. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) has explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention in the DPP cohort, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and has examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those with HbA1c ≥6.5%.  During the one-year extension of DPPOS Phase 3, we will maintain and continue to follow the well-characterized and valuable DPPOS cohort, and collect measurements of outcomes as described in the protocol. We will 1) perform new analyses to characterize the heterogeneous course of dysglycemia and its long-term complications and factors that define susceptibility or resistance to diabetes, its complications, and common chronic conditions of aging, and 2) explore the factors associated with participant retention, adherence to the protocol and completion of measurements, and determine if alternative methods can be implemented to improve retention and adherence and to expand data collection. These aims will provide important insights into prediabetes and diabetes and their long-term outcomes and could serve the potential further study of the DPPOS cohort. The DPPOS cohort is broadly representative of the current population with pre-diabetes and Type 2 diabetes (T2D), which affect >110,000,000 individuals in the U.S. with the total cost of diabetes currently estimated at $327 billion, and provides 24 years of information on their course and complications.

"Diabetes Treatments and Hypoglycemic-Related Adverse Events in Nursing Home Residents PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The National Institute of Health report Diabetes in America (2018) noted that 39.5% of adults with diabetes are aged ≥ 65 years, and the prevalence of diabetes in older adults is dramatically increasing. Management of diabetes in older adults in nursing homes is challenging due to this population having heterogeneous comorbid medical conditions, and associated medications, many of which are contraindicated for common antidiabetic drugs. Intensive diabetes management in older adults is associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia. Drug induced hypoglycemia is the 3rd most common adverse drug event among hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries. Hypoglycemia is experienced by 18% to 40% of nursing home residents. There is a lack of observational or clinical evidence pertaining to antidiabetic treatments in long-term care nursing home residents, despite this population being at high risk for diabetes, diabetes-related complications, and adverse effects of antidiabetic drugs. The American Diabetes Association’s consensus report on diabetes in older adults noted that “There are essentially no directly applicable clinical trial data on glucose control for large segments of the older diabetic patient population.” Furthermore, there are few real-world studies of antidiabetic treatments in nursing home residents. In recognition of this knowledge gap in this high-risk population, the Diabetes Mellitus Interagency Coordinating Committee, as reported in the NIDDK Recent Advances & Emerging Opportunities (2019), issued a call for studies that increase our understanding of diabetes treatments in long-term care settings, with a particular emphasis on the need to understand the impact of cognitive and functional impairments, multimorbidity, polypharmacy, and risk of hypoglycemia. These priorities are central to our proposed scope of research. Using the Federally-mandated Minimum Data Set 3.0, linked to Medicare Part A and D claims, the aims are to: 1) characterize antidiabetic treatment practices among nursing home residents; 2) identify and describe clinically relevant phenotypes of diabetic nursing home residents based on patterns of cognitive/functional impairments, comorbidities, and treatment procedures/medications, and 3) estimate the occurrence of hospitalizations (overall, hypoglycemia-related, and hypoglycemia-specific) by propensity- matched patterns of antidiabetic treatments, across resident phenotypes. We hypothesize that risks associated with antidiabetic treatments will be heterogeneous across resident phenotypes. We anticipate that the phenotypic approach we propose will serve as a foundation for future work to conduct phenotypic-specific comparative effectiveness research in support of evidence-based personalized antidiabetic treatment recommendations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Nursing home residents have a high prevalence of diabetes and high risks of diabetes complications. There is limited observational or clinical evidence supporting antidiabetic treatment decisions in long-term care nursing home residents. This study will examine the use and safety of antidiabetic treatments across subgroups (phenotypes) of older nursing home residents with diabetes.",Diabetes Treatments and Hypoglycemic-Related Adverse Events in Nursing Home Residents,10137311,R21NR019160,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age Distribution ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Americas ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Home Nursing Care ', ' Non-Professional Home Care ', ' Non-Professional Homecare ', ' Nonprofessional Home Care ', ' Nonprofessional Homecare ', ' Nursing Homecare ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hypoglycemia ', ' hypoglycemic ', ' hypoglycemic episodes ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' longterm care ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Medicare Part A ', ' Medicare Hospital Insurance Program ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Medication Management ', ' Analgesic Management ', ' Pharmacologic Management ', ' medication therapy management ', ' Guidelines ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' crosslink ', ' cross-link ', ' Polypharmacy ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' diabetic ', ' Fostering ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Diabetes Complications ', ' Diabetes-Related Complications ', ' Diabetic Complications ', ' Complications of Diabetes Mellitus ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Coin ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' 65+ years old ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' old age ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Anti-diabetic Agents ', ' Antidiabetic Agents ', ' anti-diabetic ', ' anti-diabetic drugs ', ' antidiabetic ', ' Antidiabetic Drugs ', ' diabetes risk ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' Long-Term Care Nursing ', ' Nursing Home Nursing ', ' longterm care nursing ', ' trend ', ' Modification ', ' beneficiary ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' diabetes management ', ' diabetic management ', ' Outcome ', ' blood glucose regulation ', ' glucose control ', ' glucose homeostasis ', ' glucose regulation ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' person centered ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' diabetic patient ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' multimorbidity ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' Adverse drug event ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' adverse event risk ', ' advanced analytics ', ' Comparative Effectiveness Research ', ' ']",NINR,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R21,2021,209375,MA-02
"2/22 Limited Competition for the Continuation of the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) - Clinical Center ABSTRACT Abnormal regulation of glycemia (“dysglycemia”) has a very long time course, from the earliest stage of pre- diabetes, to the onset of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), to the development of clinically detectable microvascular changes and measurable atherosclerosis, to clinically manifest complications with attendant morbidity and mortality. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) has explored the longer- term effects of T2D prevention in the DPP cohort, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and has examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those with HbA1c ≥6.5%. During the one-year extension of DPPOS Phase 3, we will maintain and continue to follow the well- characterized and valuable DPPOS cohort, and collect measurements of outcomes as described in the protocol. We will 1) perform new analyses to characterize the heterogeneous course of dysglycemia and its long-term complications and factors that define susceptibility or resistance to diabetes, its complications, and common chronic conditions of aging, and 2) explore the factors associated with participant retention, adherence to the protocol and completion of measurements, and determine if alternative methods can be implemented to improve retention and adherence and to expand data collection. These aims will provide important insights into prediabetes and diabetes and their long-term outcomes and could serve the potential further study of the DPPOS cohort.

"Understanding the role of the Complement Proteome in progressive Diabetic Kidney Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT There is a critical need to identify novel mechanisms of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) that will provide targets for new interventions. Chronic inflammation is one plausible mechanism. Using untargeted high-throughput aptamer proteomics, our recently published study has shed new light on specific, key inflammatory drivers of DKD. This was a large prospective three-cohort study that identified a novel and extremely robust circulating signature (KRIS) associated with risk of ESRD in diabetes. Our pilot study points to the data-driven connection between circulating KRIS and urinary profiles of the Complement pathway. Our hypothesis is that the Complement involvement in the kidney is a downstream effect of the systemic inflammatory processes mediating an increased DKD risk. The overarching goal of this proposal is to provide a high-resolution view of the involvement of the Complement proteome in progressive diabetic kidney disease. Aim 1 will comprehensively evaluate the etiological role of the urinary Complement proteome in progressive DKD leading to ESRD. This evaluation will leverage a prospective two-cohort population of Joslin Kidney Study (JKS) participants with an overt DKD at baseline followed for 10 years (primary outcome – incident ESRD). Measurements will utilize an aptamer proteomic technology (SOMAscan). Aim 2 will extend generalizability of the urinary Complement proteome to earlier DKD stages. The proposed study will be conducted in participants of the Preventing Early Renal Loss (PERL) clinical trial with predominantly normal renal function at baseline followed for 3 years (primary outcome - renal slope). Aim 3 proposes to gain direct insight into the intra-renal Complement proteome by targeted and untargeted protein studies in diabetic kidney tissue (Susztaklab Biobank). This project focuses on a significant public health problem, leverages the progressiveness of the disease, employs an innovative proteomic technology and stems from strong preliminary data. Advances in this project will pinpoint missing key components of DKD etiology, thereby accelerating drug development strategies for patients with diabetes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Diabetes accounts for approximately 45% of prevalent ESRD cases in the United States, therefore new interventions to prevent or decelerate development of kidney failure are critical in order to improve the health of patients with diabetes who comprise a large sector of the US population. This study will advance our knowledge regarding the etiology of diabetic kidney complications evaluating specific components of systemic (KRIS) and local, kidney inflammation (Complement). These advances offer long-term potential for the development of new therapies that will ultimately improve clinical outcomes of patients with diabetes.",Understanding the role of the Complement Proteome in progressive Diabetic Kidney Disease,10153779,R01DK123459,"['Clinical Trials ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetic Nephropathy ', ' Diabetic Kidney Disease ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Histology ', ' Immunoglobulin G ', ' 7S Gamma Globulin ', ' IgG ', ' indexing ', ' Inflammation ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Medicine ', ' Nested Case-Control Study ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Technology ', ' Tissue Banks ', ' Tissue Collection ', ' Tissue repository ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' United States ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor ', ' Cachectin Receptors ', ' TNF Receptor Family Protein ', ' TNF Receptor Superfamily ', ' TNF Receptors ', ' TNFR ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Family ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily ', ' Mediating ', ' Injury to Kidney ', ' kidney injury ', ' renal injury ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' insight ', ' diabetic ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Tubular ', ' Tubular formation ', ' Inflammatory ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' aptamer ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Proteome ', ' drug development ', ' Proteomics ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' kidney development ', ' nephrogenesis ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' complement pathway ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Progressive Disease ', ' Signaling Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Signaling Pathway Gene ', ' Signaling Protein ', ' CCL2 ', ' Chemokine, CC Motif, Ligand 2 ', ' MCAF ', ' MCP-1 ', ' MCP1 ', ' Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 ', ' Monocyte Chemotactic Protein-1 ', ' Monocyte Chemotactic and Activating Factor ', ' Monocyte Chemotactic and Activating Protein ', ' Monocyte Chemotactive and Activating Factor ', ' Monocyte Secretory Protein JE ', ' SCYA2 ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine A2 ', ' CCL2 gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' urinary ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' transcriptomics ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' stem ', ' non-diabetic ', ' nondiabetic ', ' primary outcome ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' complement system ', ' study population ', ' random forest ', ' systemic inflammatory response ', ' systemic inflammation ', ' ']",NIDDK,JOSLIN DIABETES CENTER,R01,2021,478789,MA-07

"20/22 Limited Competition for the Continuation of the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) – Clinical Center Abnormal regulation of glycemia (“dysglycemia”) has a very long time course, from the earliest stage of pre-diabetes, to the onset of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), to the development of clinically detectable microvascular changes and measurable atherosclerosis, to clinically manifest complications with attendant morbidity and mortality. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) has explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention in the DPP cohort, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and has examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c).

"Improving Glycemic Management in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Using a Context-aware Automated Insulin Delivery System Project Summary Automated insulin delivery (AID) systems offer substantial opportunities for helping people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) to improve glucose control and lower HbA1c. However, the AID has only shown a benefit during the nighttime when meals, exercise, and stress do not significantly challenge the AID. Furthermore, hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL) remains a common occurrence in people with type 1 diabetes and continues to occur even in the setting of AID, particularly with exercise. Integrating context awareness into an AID has the potential to improve glycemic time in range (70-180 mg/dL) during the daytime and reduce and possibly eliminate hypoglycemia. Contextual information can include inferred food intake, insulin dosing, inferred exercise type and duration, as well as movement patterns. An AID can be designed to recognize contextual patterns that relate to poor glycemic responses to meals and hypoglycemia and then adjust insulin dosing in response to these patterns in advance and help mitigate these problems. In this grant, we will explore how contextual information may be used within an AID to help (1) avoid hypoglycemia and (2) reduce postprandial dysglycemia. We will first conduct a data gathering study whereby we will collect a rich data set from people with T1D who will use sensor augmented pump therapy to manage their glucose. Data will be collected from these 30 patients over 28 days; data will include multivariable contextual information including continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data, insulin data, food data, physical activity data (heart rate and accelerometry), as well as indoor/outdoor contextual movement patterns gathered using a novel beacon-based context-aware sensing system called MotioWear developed by our group in collaboration with our industry partner MotioSens. Next, we will utilize this contextual data set to construct a Bayesian glucose prediction algorithm. This will include a clustering algorithm that will group contextual sequences that are similar with each other and which lead to similar glycemic outcomes. This context-aware glucose prediction algorithm will be integrated into an adaptive, personalized, smartwatch-based context-aware AID (CA-AID) system. Contextual patterns that have a high likelihood of leading to hypoglycemia or postprandial dysglycemia will inform an insulin dosing aggressiveness factor to be adjusted for similar contextual sequences observed in the future (i.e. the CA-AID will reduce insulin for contextual sequences with high likelihood of hypoglycemia such as aerobic exercise). We expect that integrating context awareness into an AID will lead to significant improvements in time in target range during the day and will help reduce time in hypoglycemia. The CA-AID will be evaluated for safety in a small pilot study. We will then evaluate the CA-AID within a 6 week clinical study in 40 adults with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump therapy. Twenty will receive the CA-AID while the other 20 will receive a standard (non-context-aware) AID. The primary outcome measures of this study is the percent time in range. We hypothesize that the CA-AID will increase time in range by 10% as compared with a non-context aware AID. Project Narrative Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, and non-traumatic amputations. While automated insulin delivery systems can help people with type 1 diabetes better manage their glucose levels during the night, improved glycemic control during the day has not been demonstrated and hypoglycemia continues to be a problem, especially during exercise. We propose to develop and evaluate in a clinical study a context-aware automated insulin delivery system that learns patterns of daily living, meal patterns, glucose patterns, insulin dosing patterns, and physical activity patterns that relate to dysglycemia and adapts the gains within the AID to improve postprandial time in target range (70-180 mg/dL) and reduce hypoglycemia.",Improving Glycemic Management in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Using a Context-aware Automated Insulin Delivery System,10147069,R01DK122583,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Aerobic Exercise ', ' Aerobic Activity ', ' Aerobic fitness ', ' Algorithms ', ' Awareness ', ' Beds ', ' Behavior ', ' Calibration ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Brittle Diabetes Mellitus ', ' IDDM ', ' Juvenile-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Sudden-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T1 DM ', ' T1 diabetes ', ' T1D ', ' T1DM ', ' Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 1 diabetes ', ' Type I Diabetes Mellitus ', ' insulin dependent diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes mellitus ', ' ketosis prone diabetes ', ' type I diabetes ', ' type one diabetes ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Engineering ', ' Exercise ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Future ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Grant ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' HbA1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Hyperglycemia ', ' hyperglycemic ', ' Hypoglycemia ', ' hypoglycemic ', ' hypoglycemic episodes ', ' Insulin ', ' Humulin R ', ' Novolin R ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Insulin Infusion Systems ', ' insulin pump ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Maps ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Restaurants ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Safety ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Schedule ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' Pump ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Physical activity ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Tactile ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' cohort ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' response ', ' glucometer ', ' glucose meter ', ' glucose monitor ', ' glucose sensor ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Dose ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' glycemic control ', ' Outcome ', ' blood glucose regulation ', ' glucose control ', ' glucose homeostasis ', ' glucose regulation ', ' usability ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' industry partner ', ' industrial partnership ', ' industry partnership ', ' arm ', ' two-arm study ', ' 2-arm study ', ' Accelerometer ', ' accelerometry ', ' activity monitor ', ' activity tracker ', ' fitbit ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' recruit ', ' smart watch ', ' smartwatch ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable biosensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,561582,OR-03
"Novel computational techniques to detect the relationship between sitting patterns and metabolic syndrome in existing cohort studies. Abstract Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions (increased blood pressure, high blood sugar, excess body fat around the waist, and abnormal cholesterol or triglyceride levels) that occur together, increasing risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. Epidemiological studies have shown that prolonged sitting is deleterious to metabolic indicators, even after adjusting for physical activity (PA). Acute laboratory trials have shown that breaking up sitting time can improve metabolic factors. Sitting is a prevalent behavior in all population groups by age, gender and ethnicity. Associations with metabolic syndrome factors, such as obesity, have also been shown in all population groups. Epidemiological studies have mostly depended on reported sitting time, especially TV reviewing. More recently large cohort studies have collected data from hip worn accelerometers and applied a cut point (e.g., 100 counts per minute) on single axis data to estimate sedentary time. Such devices have been included in numerous studies, principally because of their accuracy to measure PA intensity. Primarily used in intervention trials to reduce sitting, the thigh worn ActivPAL has been shown to more accurately assess posture and provide valid measures of sitting, standing, and sit-stand transitions. To date, very few health outcome cohort studies have included the ActivPAL. Compared to the ActivPAL and free living observations of sitting time, the 100 count cut point has been shown to underestimate prolonged sitting by substantially overestimating sit-stand transitions. New studies are showing that how we accumulate sitting time (i.e. in long or short bouts) is associated with metabolic health outcomes, and may be independent of total sitting time and PA. Study results on prolonged sitting and metabolic risk factors from accelerometer data are inconsistent and may be due to measurement error in the cut points employed. In a small sample of older women, adults, and youth we have demonstrated that novel machine learned methods can greatly improve estimates of prolonged sitting and transitions. Further development and testing of these methods would support valid applications to existing large cohort studies with raw accelerometer data to improve estimates of associations between sitting patterns and metabolic health. There are also many large cohorts (e.g. NHANES 2003/6), with quality health outcomes, but non raw accelerometer count data, so calibration methods to adjust non raw estimates of sitting time are also needed and would be attractive to researchers not yet familiar with the machine learning process. We proposed to employ 7 existing data sets (N=20,000) matched for age and spanning youth, adults and older adults. We will scale up our training and test the performance of the refined algorithms to detect sit-stand frequencies, prolonged sitting, usual bout duration and Alpha (a combination of duration & frequency). We will test performance of the algorithms against ActivPAL (ground truth) and in new samples assess predictive validity with objective health outcomes. We will test differences between the existing and new techniques using R2 and mean-squared error of prediction (via bootstrapping) and GEE techniques. Narrative There are many large studies with existing data that could be better used to understand health behaviors. We will focus on improving measurement of sitting patterns from body worn devices. We will see how sitting is related to obesity and other metabolic risk factors for chronic disease across different age groups.",Novel computational techniques to detect the relationship between sitting patterns and metabolic syndrome in existing cohort studies.,10228732,R01DK114945,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Glucose ', ' Blood Sugar ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Calibration ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Hip region structure ', ' Coxa ', ' Hip ', ' indexing ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Posture ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Testing ', ' Thigh structure ', ' Thigh ', ' Time ', ' Triglycerides ', ' Triacylglycerol ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Guidelines ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' sedentary ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Metabolic ', ' Body fat ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' NHANES ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' Body Pattern Formation ', ' Body Pattern Specification ', ' Body Patterning ', ' Frequencies ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' age group ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Reporting ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Sampling ', ' performance tests ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' cardiac disease risk ', ' cardiac disorder risk ', ' heart disorder risk ', ' heart disease risk ', ' Population Group ', ' Data ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Use of New Techniques ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' older women ', ' Accelerometer ', ' accelerometry ', ' activity monitor ', ' activity tracker ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' Longterm cohort study ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' algorithm training ', ' ']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2021,607600,CA-52

"Using predictive analytics to tailor care for patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY Over 1.5 million US adults are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (T2D) each year. These newly diagnosed individuals are at increased risk of developing debilitating complications, including renal disease, strokes, and myocardial infarctions. However, individuals differ widely in their likelihood of experiencing these adverse outcomes. Individual risk varies based on a complex interplay between pathophysiology, responsiveness to treatment, and patient capacity for self-management and making sustained lifestyle changes. Early T2D glycemic control provides a lasting benefit (""metabolic memory""); therefore, strategies that enable the effective targeting and tailoring of T2D care starting in the initial period after diagnosis may result in better long-term health outcomes. Implementing individually-tailored care strategies requires substantially more effective risk prediction tools than are currently available. This R21 proposal seeks to apply advanced analytic prediction modeling methods to a rich source of electronic health record (EHR)-derived clinical data (assessed at the time of initial diagnosis and after a year of standard management) to define individual patient risk profiles. These patient risk profiles will incorporate differences in disease physiology (e.g., reflected in factors such as age, BMI, hemoglobin A1c at diagnosis), treatment responsiveness, and early self- management results (e.g., medication adherence, weekly exercise levels, weight loss). This R21 leverages an established, well-characterized cohort of adults with incident, newly-diagnosed T2D (n=67,575) within Kaiser Permanente Northern California. We will apply advanced machine learning-based modeling methods (e.g., random forests, LASSO, extreme gradient boosting) to complete the following Aims: 1) Develop and validate a predictive model using EHR-derived patient data available at T2D diagnosis to identify patients at increased risk of suboptimal glycemic control over the five years following diagnosis and 2) Modify the Aim 1 model by incorporating clinical predictors captured during the first year following T2D diagnosis. We hypothesize that the unique information available at these two time points (i.e., initial diagnosis and after one year of standard treatment) can be used to individualize both initial and subsequent early care for patients with newly diagnosed T2D. If successful, this project's results can be applied to support targeted T2D care strategies tailored to each individual's risk of suboptimal five-year glycemic control (and later micro and macrovascular complications) based on differences in disease physiology, treatment response, and early self-care. This work will form the foundation for innovative, pragmatic clinical trials that advance our ultimate goal of providing proactive and effectively tailored early care that results in better long-term health outcomes for adults with T2D. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current initial type 2 diabetes care strategies are typically ""one-size-fits-all"" and do not address individual patient differences in risk of complications (like stroke, kidney disease), responsiveness to treatment, or ability to self-manage and successfully adopt lifestyle changes. We propose to apply advanced predictive modeling methods (including machine learning, a type of artificial intelligence) to data from the electronic health record to predict which newly diagnosed individuals are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes-related complications. The findings are intended to help clinicians individualize type 2 diabetes care from the beginning by creating optimal care plans that reduce complications and maintain long-term health.",Using

"SOCRATES: SOCial Risk and diAbetes ouTcomEs Study ABSTRACT  Health-related social needs, particularly food insecurity, housing instability, and transportation barriers, are associated with poor outcomes for people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In particular, these factors are associated with worse glycemic, blood pressure, and LDL cholesterol control, which significantly increases the risk of macrovascular and microvascular complications. They are also key drivers of racial/ethnic and socioeconomic status-based disparities in diabetes outcomes. Thus, there is a growing call for interventions to address these needs and improve T2DM outcomes. However little research has assessed whether changes in health-related social needs are associated with changes in T2DM outcomes.  This knowledge gap hampers efforts to develop effective interventions. Addressing it will provide much- needed evidence on which patients to screen for which social needs, and on which interventions targeting social needs are most likely to improve T2DM outcomes. The pathways linking social needs and T2DM outcomes are likely characterized by interactions between individual- (e.g., needs, age, gender, race/ethnicity), clinic- (e.g., clinic characteristics; specifics of the intervention), and area-level factors (e.g., local economic conditions; community resources). Given this complexity, a multi-pronged approach is needed. We will combine 3 methods of investigation: 1) longitudinal, multi-level, regression analysis; 2) innovative machine learning methods to detect novel combinations of factors associated with heterogeneous response to health- related social needs and health-related social needs interventions while avoiding spurious findings; and 3) thoughtful qualitative investigation. Such an analysis has never before been possible, because the needed data elements have not been united.  This proposal seeks to answer whether improvements in specific health-related social needs are associated with improvements in specific clinical outcomes, in what circumstances, and which approaches to addressing health-related social needs, if any, best improve outcomes. We will leverage what we believe to be the nation’s largest dataset of patient-reported health-related social needs, clinical outcomes, and community- and clinic-level data. We will examine whether changes in health-related social needs are associated with changes in hemoglobin A1c, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and LDL cholesterol. Further, we will evaluate whether clinic-based interventions seem to improve these outcomes, and if there are important variations in these interventions that are associated with different response to the intervention. The proposed work will yield important, previously unavailable evidence on how to refine and improve health-related social need interventions. Specifically, it will help us understand better how better to care for a population at high risk for T2DM complications. Overall, this project will substantially advance NIDDK’s mission to improve health equity for vulnerable individuals with T2DM. PROJECT NARRATIVE Health-related social needs, particularly food insecurity, housing instability, and transportation barriers, affect over 6 million people with type 2 diabetes mellitus, are associated with poor clinical.

"Diabetic Retinopathy: Genetics and Neurodegeneration (MSN246458) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Diabetes mellitus (DM) is the leading cause of vision loss among working aged adults. Its prevalence is increasing and despite the strides in knowledge and treatments, our understanding of the pathways leading to vision loss in DM remains limited. Hyperglycemia and duration of DM contribute to but do not fully explain the predisposition to develop diabetic retinal diseases. Given the predisposition for diabetic retinal diseases to cluster in families, genetic risk factors are thought to be important but none has so far been definitively implicated. Furthermore, data from small studies suggest that there are more phenotypes of diabetic retinal disease than are currently recognized in clinical practice. Diabetic retinal disease has traditionally been considered primarily a vascular process: diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic macular edema (DME) are the main clinical manifestations. With improved imaging modalities and image analysis algorithms, there has been increasing recognition of a new clinical manifestation of diabetic retinal disease, diabetic retinal neurodegeneration (DRN). This is visible as alterations in thickness of retinal nerve fiber (RNFL) and/or ganglion cell layer (GCL) on optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. To date, DRN is poorly understood, and its role in clinical management of patients with DM has not been established. However, if retinal neurodegeneration occurs and is progressive, it can lead to profound visual difficulties for patients with DM. DRN may account for previously unexplained poor visual outcomes among patients with diabetic retinal disease despite standard of care treatment. Dr. Channa is a retina specialist, with prior research experience in retinal imaging and clinical trials of novel treatments for DME. In this K23 career development award she proposes to use a nationally representative dataset, the UK Biobank cohort to: 1) improve our understanding of DRN by determining RNFL and GCL thickness, using OCT imaging, in participants with DM (who have no DR or DME) compared to those who do not have DM 2) determine genetic factors associated with DR, DME and DRN. Dr. Channa proposes a career development plan, which includes mentorship, coursework, publications and clinical time. This will situate her as an independent clinician-scientist with expertise in translational research employing bioinformatics and computational skills in genomics and retinal image analysis to elucidate pathways of vision loss among patients with DM, ultimately leading to development of novel therapies. Her research work and career development will take place in the academic and collaborative environment of the largest medical center in the world, where she has institutional support and mentorship to develop as an independent clinician-scientist. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this career development award we aim to use genetic and retinal imaging data to enhance our understanding of the pathways that can lead to vision loss among people with diabetic retinal diseases.

"Novel Glucose Responsive Insulin for Improved Treatment of Diabetes SUMMARY/ABSTRACT. Diabetes is rapidly becoming a global health crisis. Depending on the type of statistical methodology used, the world-wide incidence of the most common type of diabetes, adult-onset or Type II, is estimated to be in the range of 285 million. In both Type I and Type II diabetics glycemic control is paramount as the inability to maintain glycemic control results in several secondary complications including neuropathy, nephropathy and retinopathy, that often lead to amputations, dialysis and blindness as well as increased risk of cardiovascular complications. For the majority of diabetics glycemic control requires constant vigilance and monitoring of blood glucose levels. The overarching goal of this project is the development of a novel glucose responsive insulin (GRI) with a reversible, glucose dependent response at the insulin receptor. The full realization of the GRI concept would most closely mimic the benefits of a healthy pancreas and maintain euglycemia, reduce/eliminate the need for constant monitoring, and ultimately, reduce/eliminate the complications of diabetes. The scope of this proposal is the design and testing of a series of analogs that can bind glucose allosterically and demonstrate differential response at the insulin receptor. This will be achieved through completion of three aims. In Aim 1 we will use a novel computational platform to design and produce a series of GRIs with glucose binding affinity in the physiological range. In Aim 2 we will determine the glucose binding affinity of the analogues produced in Aim 1. Finally, in Aim 3 we will measure the insulin receptor (IR) and insulin like growth factor (IGF-R1) affinity of the GRI’s in the presence of glucose at physiological concentrations. Completion of these Aims will result in the identification of several GRI lead candidates with glucose binding in the physiological range and reversible glucose dependent insulin receptor binding and absence of IGF-1R binding. NARRATIVE Diabetes is rapidly becoming a global health crisis. In both Type I and Type II diabetics glycemic control is paramount as the inability to maintain glycemic control results in a number of secondary complications including neuropathy, nephropathy and retinopathy, that often lead to amputations, dialysis and blindness. A reversible glucose responsive insulin (GRI) would represent a significant improvement in diabetes care for both T1D and T2D patients. The success of this project will result in clinical candidates that will ultimately supplant basal and prandial insulins while simultaneously improving glycemic control and reducing hypoglycemic

"HABIT DESIGN: TESTING A NOVEL BEHAVIORAL APPROACH TO CORPORATE WELLNESS IN THE CONTEXT OF METABOLIC SYNDROME Abstract Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of risk factors– elevated triglycerides (TG), insufficient high- density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), elevated blood pressure (BP), elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG), and above-threshold waist circumference (WC)–that is associated with increased cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and some forms of cancer. Research suggests that addressing MetS through the workplace could significantly benefit employee health and employer healthcare costs. Habit Design, Inc., has developed an enhanced behavioral health coaching system called Habit Design (HD) that is the first to integrate habit formation, contingency management, and social learning approaches within a smartphone app to support to behavior change in corporate or employee health contexts. In this Fast Track project, we will adapt the HD approach to address MetS. In Phase I, we will 1) refine and extend existing functional prototypes of the HD app to support the latest versions of iOS and Android, 2) conduct usability testing with 8 targeted end users, and 3) prepare standard treatment manuals for the Phase II clinical trial. In Phase II, we will 1) make indicated changes to the HD app based on findings from the Phase I usability test and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of HD coaching compared to standard health coaching in a randomized trial with 424 corporate wellness program participants who have MetS, with follow-up spanning one year. Participants will employees of TriHealth in Cincinnati who have completed a health screening as part of their corporate wellness program and been identified as having at least 3/5 of the following: 1) TG ≥150 mg/dL), 2) HDL-C <40 mg/dL in males and <50 mg/dL in females, 3) BP ≥130/85 mm Hg, 4) FBG ≥100 mg/dl, and 5) WC ≥102 cm in males and ≥80 cm in females.. All participants will be coached to increase physical activity, which will be monitored with a waist-worn FitBit and Fitabase software. Additionally, participants will choose prior to randomization a goal of increasing fruit and vegetable intake or substituting water for sugar-sweetened beverages. Conditions will be stratified by choice of goal and gender. In both conditions coaching will be monitored for fidelity and delivered in 12 weekly in-person 30-minute sessions followed by one 30-minute maintenance session per month for 4 months. The primary outcome will be average daily step count measured over the course of at least one week at baseline, 4 months, 8 months, and 12 months. The secondary outcome will be standard units increase of fruit/vegetable intake or water intake, according to the participant's choice. Tertiary outcomes will consist of FBG, TG, HDL, BP, WC, and body mass index, measured at each time point. Additionally, we will conduct web-based assessment of self-reported physical activity, junk food, and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption; automaticity of exercise and fruit, vegetable, and water consumption; self-efficacy and social support for target behaviors; and health-related quality of life. Ratings of usability and satisfaction and app usage metrics will be examined. Analyses will be intent-to-treat assuming 15% loss to follow-up. Project Narrative/Relevance Metabolic syndrome is a major public health problem that affects over one in three American adults and increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and some forms of cancer. Habit Design, Inc., has developed an integrated health coaching system that uses a smartphone app to promote healthy behaviors. We will adapt it for metabolic syndrome and evaluate its effectiveness in a corporate health setting.",HABIT DESIGN: TESTING A NOVEL BEHAVIORAL APPROACH TO CORPORATE WELLNESS IN THE CONTEXT OF

"DFU Clinical Research Unit Abstract Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a prevalent diabetes complications affecting up to 25% of patients and leading to ~80,000 Americans having non-traumatic amputations each year, with five-year mortality rates of up to 40%. Recent evidence suggests that non-traumatic lower extremity amputations are on the rise, after decades of decline, in spite of advances in targeted wound care products, establishment of interdisciplinary clinical and surgical teams, and improving diabetes medical care. Given the worldwide epidemic of diabetes, the burden associated with DFU are high, including high costs of $9 billion-$13 billion per year and besides those associated with high morbidity and mortality. Thus, the establishment of a Diabetic Foot Consortium comprised of experienced DFU Clinical Research Units (CRU) for reliable DFU biomarker discovery cannot be understated. The main objective of this proposal is to integrate the robust infrastructure at Michigan Medicine with our highly skilled clinical and translational team to establish a DFU CRU as a strong contender and contributor within the DFC network that will be uniquely poised to participate in all DFU biomarker discovery and related wound healing projects undertaken by the Consortium. Additional aims are to The aims are to : identify, recruit, and phenotype a broad spectrum of DFU participants from the large base of patients with these conditions who are currently being followed at Michigan Medicine, according to the Consortium requirements; implement standardized mechanisms and protocols for effective longitudinal sample collection and retention; and actively participate in the DFC intellectually and provide all available resources to develop and support clinical study protocols to validate DFU biomarkers, including complex quantifications of wound image features; single cell, genetic, molecular, metabolomics, and microbiome analyses; and assessing additive predictors of DFU healing beyond clinical markers alone using multi-modal approaches. The expected outcome of this work is that the Michigan Medicine DFU Clinical Center will be an integral part of the Consortia collaborative network, with a highly positive impact for the entire spectrum of biomarker discovery and future novel therapies projects. Narrative This project has major public health relevance because diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) remain one of the most common secondary complications of diabetes and are the leading cause of lower extremity amputation in the US. Current treatments are ineffective and given the recent surge in major lower extremity amputations in diabetic patients despite the previous decades of decline, identification of novel treatment avenues is of critical importance. The main objective of the Diabetic Foot Clinical Center at the University of Michigan is to use our robust infrastructure and highly skilled clinical and translational research team to generate a unique platform for investigating individual contributions to DFU wound healing from clinical samples, single cell genetic and molecular analyses from DFU samples, and image analyses.",DFU Clinical Research Unit,10202575,U01DK119083,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Amputation ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clinical Markers ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Data Collection ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health delivery systems ', ' health services delivery ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Sterile coverings ', ' Dressing ', ' Engineering ', ' Epidemic ', ' Future ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Infection ', ' Institutes ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' male ', ' Marketing ', ' Medicine ', ' Methodology ', ' Michigan ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Measures ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Peripheral Nervous System Diseases ', ' PNS Diseases ', ' Peripheral Nerve Diseases ', ' Peripheral Nervous System Disorders ', ' Peripheral Neuropathy ', ' Phenotype ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Publishing ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Ulcer ', ' Ulceration ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' wound healing ', ' Wound Repair ', ' wound resolution ', ' Gender ', ' Walking ', ' Foot Ulcer ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Diabetic Foot ', ' Charcot foot ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' participant recruitment ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Diabetes Complications ', ' Diabetes-Related Complications ', ' Diabetic Complications ', ' Complications of Diabetes Mellitus ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cognitive function ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Location ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Devices ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Address ', ' diabetic foot wound ', ' Diabetic Foot Ulcer ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Analysis ', ' Collection ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Molecular ', ' Behavioral ', ' Peripheral arterial disease ', ' peripheral artery disease ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' microbiome ', ' cost ', ' healing ', ' clinical research site ', ' clinical site ', ' Outcome ', ' wound ', ' tissue wound ', ' wounding ', ' wounds ', ' prospective ', ' transcriptomics ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' public health relevance ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' FDA approved ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' diabetic patient ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' biomarker discovery ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' ineffective therapies ', ' ineffective treatment ', ' recruit ', ' practice setting ', ' microbiome analysis ', ' analyze microbiome ', ' Infrastructure ', ' wound care ', ' wound assessment ', ' wound monitoring ', ' clinical center ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2021,542357,MI-12
"15/22 Limited Competition for the Continuation of the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) - Clinical Center Abnormal regulation of glycemia (“dysglycemia”) has a very long time course, from the earliest stage of pre-diabetes, to the onset of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), to the development of clinically detectable microvascular changes and measurable atherosclerosis, to clinically manifest complications with attendant morbidity and mortality. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) has explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention in the DPP cohort, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and has examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those with HbA1c ≥6.5%.  During the one-year extension of DPPOS Phase 3, we will maintain and continue to follow the well-characterized and valuable DPPOS cohort, and collect measurements of outcomes as described in the protocol. We will 1) perform new analyses to characterize the heterogeneous course of dysglycemia and its long-term complications and factors that define susceptibility or resistance to diabetes, its complications, and common chronic conditions of aging, and 2) explore the factors associated with participant retention, adherence to the protocol and completion of measurements, and determine if alternative methods can be implemented to improve retention and adherence and to expand data collection. These aims will provide important insights into prediabetes and diabetes and their long-term outcomes and could serve the potential further study of the DPPOS cohort. The DPPOS cohort is broadly representative of the current population with pre-diabetes and Type 2 diabetes (T2D), which affect >110,000,000 individuals in the U.S. with the total cost of diabetes currently estimated at $327 billion, and provides 24 years of information on their course and complications. Understanding the effects of preventing or delaying T2D on human disease, the potential long-term benefits of lifestyle intervention and metformin, one of the most commonly used medications in the world, and the clinical course of pre-diabetes and T2D is critical if we are to apply prevention and treatment methods effectively and efficiently.

"Development and Evaluation of Personalized Explainable Machine Learning Models to Predict and Prevent Nocturnal Hypoglycemia in Type 1 Diabetes Development and Evaluation of Personalized Explainable Machine Learning Models to Predict and Prevent Nocturnal Hypoglycemia in Type 1 Diabetes Project Summary Hypoglycemia (glucose < 70 mg/dL) remains the limiting factor for achieving optimal glycemic control in type 1 diabetes (T1D), with nocturnal hypoglycemia being particularly dangerous. Nocturnal hypoglycemia may result in physical injury, poor sleep quality, fear of hypoglycemia, and hypoglycemia unawareness. Severe episodes can cause seizures and unconsciousness requiring emergency care, and even death (dead in bed syndrome). While automated insulin delivery (AID) systems have shown benefits in glucose control during the night, nighttime hypoglycemia still occurs. Moreover, many people with T1D manage their glucose with continuous subcutaneous infusion pump (CSII) therapy or multiple daily insulin injections (MDI) therapy. Data updated between 2013 and 2014 from 16,061 individuals with T1D participating in the T1D Exchange clinic registry showed that approximately 40% participants managed their glucose with MDI. In this project, we propose to develop and evaluate a personalized decision support tool that collects and analyzes glucose measurements, insulin, meals, and physical activity data to predict at bedtime the likelihood of overnight hypoglycemia and recommend a proactive carbohydrate intervention to substantially reduce nocturnal hypoglycemia. In the engineering development phase of the project, we will use unique datasets of time-matched glucose management data (i.e., continuous glucose measurements, insulin, meals, and exercise) from pump, closed- loop and MDI users to extract information about the major contributors to nocturnal hypoglycemia risk and train a population-based prediction model that will be personalized over time to better capture inter-subject variability. We will design a bedtime intervention consisting of a bedtime smart snack with variable nutrient content that can prevent nighttime hypoglycemia. Snacks will vary by macronutrient content and size to optimize time to peak post-prandial glycemia that will match the timing to predicted episode of hypoglycemia. We will conduct a randomized cross-over study to evaluate our smartphone-based decision support tool on a cohort of 20 people with T1D who are MDI users and are at higher risk of experiencing hypoglycemia. Participants will be randomly assigned to either first use CGM only (control period) followed by a smartphone- based decision support tool + nocturnal hypoglycemia intervention (intervention period), or vice-versa. The control and intervention periods will have a duration of three weeks each. We will measure the effect of the intervention by comparing the percent time in nocturnal hypoglycemia during the control period vs. the intervention period. We will also retrospectively measure the accuracy of the prediction model in predicting nocturnal hypoglycemia using data from the control period. We expect that the proposed bedtime intervention will lead to a significant reduction in time spent in hypoglycemia overnight of at least 50% reduction relative to baseline. Project Narrative Nocturnal hypoglycemia is one of the most challenging side effects of insulin-intensive diabetes therapy and accounts for more than 50% of level 2 hypoglycemia events (glucose < 54 mg/dL). Despite new glucose sensing technologies and automated insulin delivery systems, nocturnal hypoglycemia is a common problem for people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) with potentially fatal consequences as symptoms and sensor alarms may not be detected while sleeping. We propose to design a personalized decision support tool to accurately predict and prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia in people with T1D who are using either multiple daily insulin injections, pumps, or closed-loop control; and we will evaluate the developed machine learning based prediction models and a smart snack bedtime intervention within a clinical study involving people on multiple daily insulin injections therapy.",Development and Evaluation of Personalized Explainable Machine Learning Models to Predict and Prevent Nocturnal Hypoglycemia in Type 1 Diabetes,10373516,R21DK128582,"['compare intervention ', ' poor sleep ', ' Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Beds ', ' Carbohydrates ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Brittle Diabetes Mellitus ', ' IDDM ', ' Juvenile-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Sudden-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T1 DM ', ' T1 diabetes ', ' T1D ', ' T1DM ', ' Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 1 diabetes ', ' Type I Diabetes Mellitus ', ' insulin dependent diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes mellitus ', ' ketosis prone diabetes ', ' type I diabetes ', ' type one diabetes ', ' Engineering ', ' Exercise ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hyperglycemia ', ' hyperglycemic ', ' Hypoglycemia ', ' hypoglycemic ', ' hypoglycemic episodes ', ' Infusion Pumps ', ' Infusors ', ' Perfusion Pumps ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' injection therapy ', ' Insulin ', ' Humulin R ', ' Novolin R ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Learning ', ' Registries ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Seizures ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Sleep ', ' Specificity ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' Unconscious State ', ' Unconscious ', ' Unconsciousness ', ' consciousness loss ', ' Measures ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Cross-Over Studies ', ' Crossover Studies ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' Pump ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Fiber ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' subdermal ', ' subcutaneous ', ' System ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Nutrient ', ' simulation ', ' Participant ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' diabetes therapy ', ' diabetes mellitus therapy ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Macronutrients Nutrition ', ' Macronutrients ', ' Update ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' wireless ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Emergency Care ', ' ED care ', ' ER care ', ' Emergency Department care ', ' Emergency Room care ', ' Emergency health care ', ' Emergency healthcare ', ' Emergency medical care ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' diabetes management ', ' diabetic management ', ' glycemic control ', ' hypoglycemia unawareness ', ' blood glucose regulation ', ' glucose control ', ' glucose homeostasis ', ' glucose regulation ', ' Consumption ', ' high risk ', ' population based ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' intervention effect ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' support tools ', ' personalized decision ', ' individualized clinical decision ', ' individualized decision ', ' personalized clinical decision ', ' personalized data-driven decision ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' recruit ', ' sensor technology ', ' sensing technology ', ' Injections ', ' sleep quality ', ' quality of sleep ', ' side effect ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' comparison intervention ', ' ']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,162600,OR-03
"Development of a personalized infusion failure detection algorithm combining tissue counter pressure and blood glucose data for closed-loop diabetes management PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Advances in diabetes care technology over the past several decades, including improvements in continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), have led to more streamlined treatments and reduced burden for patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). As the field moves toward increasingly autonomous, closed-loop systems for management of T1D, infusion set failure (ISF) remains a health risk to patients and a barrier to the development of artificial pancreas systems. ISF, the disruption of fluid flow from insulin pump to patient causing loss of glycemic control, affects an estimated 50% of pump wearers, placing them at risk for hyperglycemia and life-threatening complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis. Because modern insulin pumps are not equipped with a mechanism for monitoring infusion performance, patients may not know an ISF has occurred until experiencing symptoms of hyperglycemia. There is no existing technology capable of accurately identifying ISF in real-time, before dysregulation of blood glucose (BG). Diatech Diabetes is addressing this unmet need with SmartFusion, an AI-based platform to monitor infusion performance, immediately alert patients when ISF occurs, and help users infuse confidently and safely. Diatech’s novel algorithm leverages tissue counter pressure (TCP) and CGM data to offer a superior method for ISF detection. The company’s long-term vision is that by detecting ISF in real time, SmartFusion will improve patients’ glycemic control, prevent complications of hyperglycemia, and reduce excess medical costs. Diatech has already collected preliminary data to show that TCP waveforms can feasibly be leveraged to differentiate healthy and malfunctioned infusions. The goal of this Phase I SBIR proposal is to collect increasingly complex and representative preclinical data to train and optimize the TCP-CGM algorithm and demonstrate proof-of-concept that it can accurately detect ISF. Diatech will pursue this goal through the following aims: 1) collect and characterize labeled in vivo TCP and x-ray imaging data of typical and malfunctioned infusions, 2) collect and characterize labeled in vivo TCP and BG/CGM data of failure modes consistent with ISF in immobilized diabetic swine, and 3) collect 3-day TCP and BG/CGM data from ambulatory diabetic swine with failure modes consistent with ISF. Successful completion of the project will result in a novel TCP-CGM algorithm to accurately detect ISF in closed- loop systems. The algorithm will be further optimized through collection and integration of clinical data in Phase II. SmartFusion will ultimately be integrated into insulin pumps and diabetes management platforms to provide real-time ISF detection and personalized recommendations for ISF prevention. Further, by enabling new avenues for control of closed-loop systems, SmartFusion can offer a significant leap forward for implementation of artificial pancreas technology, leading to improved health and quality of life for patients living with T1D. PROJECT NARRATIVE More than one million type 1 diabetes patients throughout the world rely on insulin pumps to deliver their vital medication, but infusion failures are common and can lead to serious and costly complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis. There is no existing technology that accurately detects infusion failures and alerts patients to disruptions in treatment before they develop elevated blood glucose.

Her long-term goal is to become an independent researcher and leader in evaluating, improving, and individualizing diabetes care through effective use of big data completed by qualitative insights from patients and those involved in their care. The short-term training goals of this proposal are to acquire: 1) proficiency in statistics and data science; 2) experience in qualitative research; 3) skills in clinical trial design; and 4) communication and leadership skills to lead multi-disciplinary research. The proposal's research will be conducted at Mayo Clinic, which has a strong history of training physician scientists and a well-developed infrastructure for education and research. Dr. McCoy has access to an ideal set of data assets, the OptumLabs Data Warehouse and the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Diabetes Registry, and the support of an exceptional team of mentors and advisors who are national leaders in diabetes outcomes and health care delivery research, shared decision-making, qualitative research, and data science. Optimization of glycemic control, while avoiding severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, is the cornerstone of diabetes management. Severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia are often preventable, yet continue to incur substantial morbidity, psychological distress, impaired quality of life, and economic burden. There are no validated tools to predict these events and as a result clinicians lack a practical and reliable means to identify high risk patients. The goal of Dr. McCoy's work is to address this critical gap in diabetes management. In Aim 1, she will use large database analysis and novel analytic methods to characterize the patterns of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia among adults with diabetes in the U.S. In Aim 2, she will build on Aim 1 to develop and validate computationally efficient concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia that could be used in clinical encounters. In Aim 3, she will directly engage patients and their clinicians in conversation about severe hypoglycemia /hyperglycemia risk in order to better understand how information about severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk is perceived, interpreted, and used. These studies will serve as foundation for two R01 applications to be submitted during Years 4 and 5, and will advance the science and practice of personalized diabetes care through integration of data science and qualitative methods for the purpose of understanding, predicting, and ultimately preventing severe hypoglycemic/hyperglycemic events. Dr. McCoy has a proven track record of scientific productivity and innovation, and a strong foundation in using secondary data for health services and outcomes research in diabetes. In summary, the training, mentoring, and research proposed here are essential for Dr. McCoy's career development as she develops research independence and expertise in the crucial interface between patients and their clinical teams, evidence-based medicine, and big data. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events in the management of diabetes mellitus continue to incur high morbidity, psychological distress, and economic costs; yet, these events may be prevented with individualization of treatment goals and regimens if high risk patients are identified prospectively. The proposed research will leverage big data analytics and qualitative research to 1) characterize the epidemiology of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in the U.S.; 2) develop and validate concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia; and 3) enrich the understanding of severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk and risk model utilization through qualitative patient and clinician engagement.",Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes,10221675,K23DK114497,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Calibration ', ' California ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health delivery systems ', ' health services delivery ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hyperglycemia ', ' hyperglycemic ', ' Hypoglycemia ', ' hypoglycemic ', ' hypoglycemic episodes ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Mentors ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Productivity ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' statistics ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Development Plans ', ' Endocrinologist ', ' tool ', ' Evidence Based Medicine ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' economic cost ', ' social ', ' psychological distress ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' K23 Award ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Program ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Research Training ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Outcomes and Health Services Research ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' point of care ', ' disease phenotype ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' data integration ', ' diabetes management ', ' diabetic management ', ' glycemic control ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' shared decision making ', ' Regimen ', ' data registry ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' individualized medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapeutic strategy ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' Patient risk ', ' health data ', ' support tools ', ' education research ', ' Data Science ', ' individual patient ', ' clinical decision support ', ' data warehouse ', ' Infrastructure ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' Big Data Methods ', ' Big Data Analytics ', ' Big Data Tools ', ' risk prediction model ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' clinical encounter ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,K23,2021,168817,MN-01
"The Epitranscriptome as a Novel Mechanism of Arsenic-Induced Diabetes. SUMMARY In the United States, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is particularly high among American Indian (AI) communities. Arsenic (As), a pervasive environmental contaminant disproportionately affecting AI communities, may explain this increased risk. Arsenic induces oxidative stress and systemic low-grade inflammation leading to β-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance in target tissues. However, the impact of As on T2DM has been disputed due to a lack of coherent mechanism for these findings. Previous studies have focused on epigenomic mechanisms (e.g., DNA methylation, histone modifications), overlooking downstream regulatory mechanisms that can more directly shape phenotypes. We propose to investigate the RNA modification N6- methyladenosine (m6A), the most prevalent epitranscriptomic modification on messenger RNA, which is directly involved in the cellular stress response. In experimental systems, arsenic induces a m6A response. m6A also modulates key processes underlying T2DM pathogenesis, including immune response and systemic inflammation. m6A is controlled by a group of proteins called reader, writer, and erasers (RWEs), responsible for adding, interpreting, and removing m6A marks. Fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) is one example of an arsenic-sensitive m6A eraser with strong ties to T2DM and glucose homeostasis. Our pilot study in elderly men exposed to low-level arsenic supported these findings. We propose to test the hypothesis that altered m6A and RWEs are plausible mechanisms for As-related T2DM in the Strong Heart Study (SHS). The SHS is an ongoing longitudinal study in AI communities in Arizona, Oklahoma, and North/South Dakota with detailed clinical data for T2DM and metabolic syndrome (MetS). The SHS has measured speciated As exposure data covering childhood and adult exposure windows, both independently associated with T2DM in previous research. Leveraging the cohort design, exposure and phenotypic data, infrastructure, and study team, we propose to conduct epitranscriptomic analysis of mRNA m6A profiles via m6A sequencing and measure mRNA expression of 20 RWEs using whole blood from 1100 participants at the upcoming SHS follow up visit (scheduled for 2022- 23). Our specific aims are to: 1) determine the association of past and current As exposure with epitranscriptomic profiles of m6A and RWEs mRNA expression levels in blood; 2) determine the association of blood m6A epitranscriptomic profiles with metabolic markers and MetS, clinical T2DM prevalence, and T2DM control (glycated hemoglobin, albuminuria); 3) develop a predictive m6A fingerprint that quantifies the risk of T2DM due to As exposure using machine learning approaches. For aims 1 and 2 we will further use Mendelian randomization to assess causal relationships. Characterization of m6A profiles in a population of AI adults highly impacted by T2DM will reveal biological features linking a pervasive toxicant such as As to diabetes. In addition to leading to interventions to reduce As exposure in the US and globally, defining the roles of m6A and RWEs in T2DM may contribute to new targets for future diabetes therapies. NARRATIVE Increasing evidence supports the role of arsenic exposure in diabetes development. We will evaluate novel epitranscriptomic mechanisms linking arsenic to diabetes and metabolic dysfunction in American Indian communities. This study can provide insight into novel pathways of arsenic related diabetes, identify prevention interventions, and inform recommendations for arsenic levels in water and food.",The Epitranscriptome as a Novel Mechanism of Arsenic-Induced Diabetes.,10140691,R01ES032638,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Albuminuria ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Arizona ', ' Arsenic ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Cells ', ' Peripheral Blood Cell ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Markers ', ' Communities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Environmental Pollution ', ' environmental contaminant ', ' environmental contamination ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Glycosylated Hemoglobin ', ' Glycated Hemoglobins ', ' Heart ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Inflammation ', ' Insulin ', ' Humulin R ', ' Novolin R ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Joints ', ' Lipids ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Names ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Oklahoma ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Savings ', ' South Dakota ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Measures ', ' Schedule ', ' Hepatic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Funding ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' Whole Blood ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Life ', ' Severities ', ' System ', ' Elderly man ', ' Visit ', ' cohort ', ' toxicant ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Disputes ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' RNA Stability ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' diabetes therapy ', ' diabetes mellitus therapy ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' histone modification ', ' Insulin Cell ', ' Insulin Secreting Cell ', ' β-cell ', ' β-cells ', ' βCell ', ' Beta Cell ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' Metabolic Marker ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' intervention for prevention ', ' prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' preventive intervention ', ' Reader ', ' Cellular Stress Response ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Transcript ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' epigenomics ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' blood glucose regulation ', ' glucose control ', ' glucose homeostasis ', ' glucose regulation ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' phenotypic data ', ' Metabolic dysfunction ', ' epitranscriptomics ', ' epitranscriptome ', ' multidimensional data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' systemic inflammatory response ', ' systemic inflammation ', ' data infrastructure ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' Mendelian randomization ', ' ']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,684582,NY-13
"the Diabetes Research for Equity through Advanced Multilevel Science Center for Diabetes Translational Research (DREAMS-CDTR) Project Summary/Abstract Diabetes mellitus is a significant health burden in the U.S. and California leads the nation in incident cases and costs of Type 2 Diabetes. Individuals with low socioeconomic status, older adults, rural populations, and racial and ethnic minorities are at highest risk. The drivers of these disparities include a complex combination of interacting factors at the individual, family, community, health system, societal, and policy levels. Programs and policies that can effectively translate high-quality, evidence-based diabetes interventions into widespread practice across diverse communities, modes of delivery, and a range of settings are desperately needed. The Diabetes Research for Equity through Advanced Multilevel Science Center for Diabetes Translational Research (DREAMS-CDTR) aims to advance health equity science through the development and translation of: 1) innovations and structural changes to healthcare delivery systems that substantively reduce health inequalities, and 2) innovative, scalable interventions to alter the socioenvironmental drivers of the Type 2 Diabetes epidemic and associated disparities. Focusing on the northern California and Central Valley regions of California, the DREAMS-CDTR will conduct clinical research and interventions designed to inform practice and policy change at the health system, community and policy levels. The DREAMS-CDTR (formerly Health Delivery Systems) brings together translational science core faculty who have expertise in diverse, multi-level areas including: food insecurity, medication adherence, health communication, health IT, social policy, and cost effectiveness analysis. DREAMS-CDTR will involve four regional academic sites with a range of public and non-profit health systems that serve large and diverse populations: Kaiser Permanente Northern California’s Division of Research and the University of California at San Francisco, Merced and Davis. The DREAMS-CDTR activities include: an Administrative Core, Pilot and Feasibility Program, Enrichment Program, and three coordinated research cores - Health Equity & Action Translational (HEAT) core, Methods and Data Integration (MDI) translational core, and National Diabetes Policy Research Resource (DPR) core. The HEAT Core will employ a multi-level systems approach to designing rigorous action-oriented observational and interventional research. The MDI Core will systematically prepare and support DREAMS-CDTR members in harnessing novel advances in methods and data to achieve greater health equity in Type 2 Diabetes. Lastly, the novel National DPR Core will extend the reach of the DREAMS-CDTR expertise and resources beyond the primary institutions in five key areas of expertise: (1) natural experiments research,(2) health economics, including comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness analysis; (3) simulation modeling, (4) machine learning, and (5) communicating science to policy-making institutions, community partners, health departments, and human service organizations. Narrative The purpose of this renewal application is to continue and refocus the work of the Health Delivery Systems Center for Diabetes Translational Research (HDS-CDTR) (P30 DK092924), renamed the Diabetes Research for Equity through Advanced Multilevel Science Center for Diabetes Translational Research (DREAMS- CDTR), on reducing diabetes related health disparities and improving health equity. Refocused on northern California and its Central Valley, the DREAMS-CDTR is a collaborative partnership between the Kaiser Permanente Northern California’s Division of Research and the University of California at San Francisco, Merced and Davis. This Center leverages expertise in two Core Translational Research areas of health equity and methods and data integration and from a national diabetes policy resources core to accelerate the

"Machine learning for analysis of walking patterns and physical activity in knee osteoarthritis Project Summary/Abstract Individuals with knee osteoarthritis (OA) exhibit altered walking patterns that cause repetitive, abnormal forces on the knee joint, leading to disease progression. Existing interventions to reduce knee loading during walking have not resulted in meaningful change in knee OA symptoms or joint structure. A key limitation of existing research has been the use of simplified metrics to describe walking patterns and not accounting for walking amount and intensity (i.e. physical activity). The goal of this research is to comprehensively characterize walking patterns and activity in people with and without knee OA and to assess the associations of walking with 2-year change in knee OA outcomes. Machine learning approaches will be used to analyze ground reaction force (GRF) data and accelerometer-derived physical activity metrics in an existing, large, well- characterized cohort (n=2575) from the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST). Machine learning approaches that use selected features and those that are agnostic and utilize all available information from time-varying GRFs will be used in combination with physical activity metrics to classify symptomatic and structural change. The results from machine learning approaches will be compared to those of common statistical approaches. This research will allow for characterization of the complex relationships between walking patterns and activity, providing novel insights into OA disease processes. Further, this research will provide valuable training in applying machine learning approaches to biomechanics data and may inform patient-specific strategies to optimize walking patterns and physical activity for personalized knee OA management.  The principal investigator will leverage prior training in biomedical engineering applied to OA research to further advance her skills in traditional and agnostic machine learning approaches for analyses of biomechanics and physical activity data. The sponsor and co-sponsor at Boston University (BU) will provide mentorship in clinical aspects of OA, implementation of the proposed studies in a large cohort, grantsmanship, and career development. The team will work with a collaborator in computational biomedicine at BU with expertise in machine learning to achieve the scientific and training goals of this project. In addition to hands-on training, the principal investigator will enroll in didactic coursework and workshops at BU related to machine learning and computer programming. Other key aspects of training include participation in research and networking opportunities at BU and other local Institutions, as well as national and international meetings. The sponsors and the Institution provide an environment where the PI will work and learn as a part of a diverse and interdisciplinary team of OA researchers across rehabilitation, rheumatology, epidemiology, computational methods, and imaging specialties. This postdoctoral training environment will prepare the principal investigator for a career as an independent researcher with expertise in machine learning approaches as applied to biomechanics for the study of musculoskeletal diseases such as osteoarthritis. Narrative This research will use machine learning to understand how walking patterns and physical activity in people with knee osteoarthritis are related to pain and disease worsening.

However, there is less consistent evidence that lowering glucose levels to near normal levels prevent or slows vascular complications, particularly in more advanced stages of type 2 diabetes. The recent VADT, ACCORD, and ADVANCE trials demonstrated that intensive efforts to lower glucose had only modest effects on the rate of vascular complications. Why glycemic control strategies that focused on reduction of glucose levels and HbA1c did not have the anticipated success in reducing vascular outcomes is not clear. This has raised the possibility that (1) there are glycemic metrics beyond those that reflect average glucose control, such as HbA1c, that can explain this paradox, and (2) there exists heterogeneous treatment effects of intensive glycemic therapy for macrovascular and microvascular complications, with subgroups of patients who do less well with intensive treatment counter-balancing those that do respond. In recent reports we have demonstrated long-term glycemic variability was associated with risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, even after adjusting for traditional markers of glycemic control. Importantly, this appeared most relevant to those receiving intensive glycemic control. These preliminary findings support careful examination of determinants and consequences of glycemic variability. In this proposal, we therefore propose to (a) evaluate and compare the importance of glycemic variation, both short-term measured by 1,5-anhydroglucitol and long-term in the development of macro and microvascular complications; (b) to study whether intensive treatment is beneficial in preventing vascular outcomes when glycemic variation is constrained; (c) genetic variants associated with glycemic variation in T2D patients will explain additional risk in progression to vascular complications beyond the genetic variants associated with mean glycemic levels. PROJECT NARRATIVE The major goals of glucose-lowering therapy in T2D are to reduce the incidence and progression of both microvascular and macrovascular complications. However, several large clinical trials that focused on reduction of glucose levels and HbA1c did not have the anticipated success in reducing macrovascular outcomes. Our proposal focuses on filling the gap of identifying the role of glycemic variability (short-term and long-term) in optimizing management of diabetes and vascular complications.",A Role for Glycemic Variation in Optimizing Management of Diabetes and Vascular Complications,10219353,R21HL150374,"['Algorithms ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Goals ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' HbA1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Incidence ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Genetic ', ' Event ', ' Visit ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' macrovascular disease ', ' macrovascular complication ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' diabetes management ', ' diabetic management ', ' glycemic control ', ' Outcome ', ' blood glucose regulation ', ' glucose control ', ' glucose homeostasis ', ' glucose regulation ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' treatment effect ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' database of Genotypes and Phenotypes ', ' dbGaP ', ' Microvascular Dysfunction ', ' microvascular complications ', ' microvascular disease ', ' small vessel disease ', ' individualized medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapeutic strategy ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' Patient risk ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' secondary analysis ', ' treatment arm ', ' intervention arm ', ' random forest ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2021,127224,CA-33
