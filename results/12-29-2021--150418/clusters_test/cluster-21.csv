"Transfer Learning for Digital Curation of the EMR Clinical Narrative Project Summary This proposal is in response to PAR 18-796 to seek support for advancing methodologies for a transfer learning framework for the digital curation of the Electronic Medical Records (EMR) clinical narrative. In the current era of increasing importance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in biomedicine, our proposal tackles a critical AI component – automated annotation of health-related text. Since 2015 the development and application of machine learning (ML) methods has exploded propelled by the convergence of plentiful digitized unstructured data (text, speech, images), hardware and the refinement of neural networks or deep learning. 2018 marked a turning point in Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly transfer learning through pre-trained models like Universal Language Model Fine-tuning for Text Classification, Allen AI's ELMO, OpenAI's Open-GPT. In November 2018, Google published the Bidirectional Encodings Representations from Transformers (BERT), a transformer-based model pre-trained on massive general text databases (3.3B words total). The publication reported using BERT representations to build classifiers for 11 NLP tasks which outperformed the state-of-the- art (SOTA) with large margins. The NLP research community jumped to the idea of exploring this new framework but quickly came to the realization that building BERT-style models from scratch is affordable and feasible to only a few. Thus, research investigation proceeded in the direction of using these gigantic models as resources for language representations. Scientific efforts focused on pre-trained models (e.g. BERT) as a source of extracting high quality language features or fine-tuning on a specific task, i.e. using a model as a checkpoint and re-training with much smaller amounts of task-specific data to produce predictions by typically adding one fully-connected layer on top of the representations and training for a few epochs. This general watershed shift in NLP to transfer learning which parallels the developments in computer vision a few years ago coupled with our latest work brings to the forefront a critical NLP research topic ripe for exploration – a transfer learning framework for the digital curation of the EMR clinical narrative. The proposed work is research of novel scientific methods for extracting detailed information from health-related text especially the EMR, the major source of phenotype data for patients. Precise phenotype information is needed to advance translational research, particularly to unravel the effects of genetic, epigenetic, and systems changes on responsiveness. This research is in line with the latest developments in neural deep learning approaches and AI in general and is expected to enhance biomedical research and through that the health of the public. Project Narrative/Relevance We propose research on transfer learning methods for the digital curation of a key biomedical asset – the clinical narrative as part of the Electronic Medical Record.

"Early Detection and Treatment of Emerging Cognitive-Linguistic Impairment in Minority Cognitive Aging and Primary Progressive Aphasia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dementia is among the most daunting public health crises facing industrialized nations. Many countries, including the United States,1 have recently adopted comprehensive national dementia strategies.2 The US National Dementia Strategy (section 2B) has identified early diagnosis and links to community treatment services as pillars of its management plan. The availability of evidence-based outpatient treatment for progressive language impairments remains exceedingly sparse. In 2014, we began to address this void via a longitudinal intervention targeting maintenance of a core vocabulary consisting of 100 words over two years. This caregiver-friendly treatment is showing great promise for promoting the retention of key vocabulary in frontotemporal degeneration and Alzheimer's Disease. A secondary aim involved evaluating prediction of later language forgetting. We have learned much during this initial project period, and its renewal has the potential to tell us much more. Our current proposal consists of three aims, all of which directly align both with the US National Dementia Strategy and the mission of our funding institute (i.e., the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders).3 In Specific Aim 1 (SA1), we will evaluate the long-term effectiveness of a regimen of noninvasive brain stimulation (transcranial direct current stimulation) delivered over the anterior temporal lobes as an adjuvant to our ongoing semantic behavioral treatment. We will do so using a crossover design where two groups of patients with semantic variant Primary Progressive Aphasia complete sham and active stimulation conditions paired with behavioral treatment (order counterbalanced). We will subsequently follow this patient cohort over two years to evaluate the durability of treatment gains. In SA2, we will evaluate predictors of emerging cognitive-linguistic impairment in a vastly underserved population (i.e., older African American adults). We will identify older adults who are at increased risk for conversion to mild cognitive impairment as indexed by global cognitive and language measures. We will then follow and characterize this prospective cohort using sensitive behavioral (gaze patterns during visual confrontation naming) and neuropsychological markers. Finally, in SA3 we will evaluate representation, processing, and shifts in abstract word meaning as functions of age, pathology, and individual differences (e.g., vocabulary size, years of education) using machine learning. This renewal reflects the continuation of a productive and rigorous line of research that will yield complementary data about human semantic memory, best practices in promoting language maintenance, and variability of age-associated language change. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will investigate the effectiveness of pairing non-invasive brain stimulation with an ongoing behavioral treatment targeting maintenance of a small functional vocabulary in patients with progressive naming disorders. In a secondary sequence of aims, we will evaluate processing of abstract words (e.g., love, truth) and prediction of evolving language impairment in a prospective cohort of lower-income, predominantly minority older adults with the aim of improving early detection of cognitive-linguistic decline.",Early Detection and Treatment of Emerging Cognitive-Linguistic Impairment in Minority Cognitive Aging

"CLAMP-CS: a Cloud-based, Service-oriented, high-performance Natural Language Processing Platform for Healthcare Project Summary Wide adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has led to huge clinical databases, which enable the rapid growth of healthcare analytics market. One particular challenge for analyzing EHRs data is that much detailed patient information is embedded in clinical documents and not directly available for downstream analysis. Therefore, clinical natural language processing (NLP) technologies, which can unlock information embedded in clinical narratives, have received great attention, with an estimated global market of $2.65 billion by 2021 . In our previous work, we have developed CLAMP (Clinical Language Annotation, Modeling, and Processing), a clinical NLP tool with demonstrated superior performance through multiple international NLP challenges and a large user community (over 1,500 downloads by users from over 700 organizations). Commercialization of CLAMP by Melax Technologies Inc. has been successful (i.e., with a dozen licensed customers now); but it also reveals its limitations as a desktop application in the Cloud era. Therefore, we propose to extend CLAMP to a new Cloud- based, Service-oriented platform (called CLAMP-CS), which will address the identified challenges by: 1) improving clinical NLP performance and reducing annotation cost by leveraging the state-of-the-art algorithms such as deep learning, active learning and transfer learning and making them accessible to less experienced users; 2) following new service-oriented architectures to make CLAMP-CS available via SaaS and PaaS, ready for Cloud-based development and deployment; and 3) improving CLAMP-CS interoperability with downstream applications following two widely used standard representations: HL7 FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) and OMOP CMD (Common Data Model), to support the use cases in clinical operations and research respectively. With these advanced features, we believe CLAMP-CS will be a leading clinical NLP system in the market and it will accelerate the adoption of NLP technology for diverse healthcare applications and clinical/translational research. Project Narrative In this study, we plan to develop a new clinical natural language processing (NLP) tool based on the existing widely used CLAMP (Clinical Language Annotation, Modeling, and Processing) system, to support enterprise development and deployment of NLP solutions in healthcare. We believe that the new generation of Cloud- based, service-oriented NLP tool will accelerate the adoption of NLP technology for diverse healthcare applications and clinical and translational research.","CLAMP-CS: a Cloud-based, Service-oriented, high-performance Natural Language Processing Platform for Healthcare",10136739,R44TR003254,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Attention ', ' Belief ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Hospital Administration ', ' Hospital Management ', ' Language ', ' language training ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Operations Research ', ' Patients ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Technology ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' insight ', ' Licensing ', ' Active Learning ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' System ', ' Clampings ', ' Closure by clamp ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' International ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' active method ', ' active technique ', ' active treatment ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' rapid growth ', ' next generation ', ' interoperability ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' user-friendly ', ' commercialization ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' cloud computer ', ' cloud based ', ' model building ', ' web app ', ' web application ', ' deep learning ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' learning algorithm ', ' Natural Language Processing pipeline ', ' NLP pipeline ', ' clinical database ', ' Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources ', ' FHIR ', ' ']",NCATS,"MELAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R44,2021,496453,TX-09
"Learning Universal Patient Representations from Clinical Text with Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Networks Project Summary In this project we develop new methods for extracting important information from electronic health records based on recurrent neural networks. These methods represent the hierarchical and sequential nature of human language, leverage large scale datasets to make learning sophisticated representations possible, and make use of novel sources of supervision that are available at this scale. The model architecture we propose is a hierarchical recurrent neural network (RNN). This architecture explicitly represents temporality at multiple different time scales, with stacked RNN layers representing words, sentences, paragraphs, and documents. At the word level, the model is trained to predict important pieces of clinical information, such as negation and temporality, using existing labeled data sets. Training for clinical information extraction at the lowest level ensures that the higher-level models have a foundation of medically relevant inputs. We are still left with the challenge of training higher-level networks, because these models require massive amounts of labeled training data to learn. We solve this problem by taking advantage of the temporal aspect of information in an EHR, and having each higher-level recurrent layer train getting supervision from the future. For example, the document RNN is trained to predict billing codes and NLP concept codes that were found in the subsequent document. This source of supervision is scalable, and our preliminary data shows that it is effective at learning how to generate generalizable patient representations. The patient representations that our model learns are shareable across multiple tasks, potentially streamlining EHR-based research by eliminating what was previously a manual step – designing text-based variables to represent patients. We demonstrate a new workflow for text-based EHR research, showing how the same representations can be used for two completely distinct phenotyping tasks. These phenotyping studies make use of high-quality datasets of patients with pulmonary hypertension and autism spectrum disorder at Boston Children’s Hospital. PH is relatively rare, so finding every patient with a phenotyping algorithm is important for clinical research. ASD has several sub-phenotypes, and finding large numbers of patients from each sub- phenotype can help to better understand the mechanisms of ASD. Along with demonstrating the applicability of our representations on these specific clinical research use cases, we incorporate our patient representations into the i2b2 clinical research software, making them available to all clinical investigators using this platform at Boston Children’s Hospital. Project Narrative This project develops methods for extracting universal patient representations from unstructured text in electronic health records. These methods leverage huge amounts of clinical data, recurrent neural network architectures, and novel training techniques to incorporate information at multiple time scales. These methods are evaluated using public datasets to promote reproducibility, and applied to clinical research tasks that extend the knowledge of patients with pulmonary hypertension and autism spectrum disorder at Boston Children’s Hospital.",Learning Universal Patient Representations from Clinical Text with Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Networks,10085674,R01LM012973,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Boston ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Felis catus ', ' Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Feline Species ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Pediatric Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Pulmonary Hypertension ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Israel ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Records ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Supervision ', ' Time ', ' Information Retrieval ', ' Information extraction ', ' Training Technics ', ' Training Technique ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Medical center ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Orphan Disease ', ' Rare Disorder ', ' orphan disorder ', ' Rare Diseases ', ' novel ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Human Nature ', ' Human Characteristics ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' disease phenotype ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' data resource ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' neural network ', ' machine translation ', ' neural network architecture ', ' neural net architecture ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' phenotyping algorithm ', ' ']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,366696,MA-07
"A framework to enhance radiology structured report by invoking NLP and DL:  Models and Applications PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  In radiology practices, timely and accurate formulation of reports is closely linked to patient satisfaction, physician productivity, and reimbursement. While the American College of Radiology and the Radiological Soci- ety of North America have recommended implementation of structured reporting to facilitate clear and consistent communication between radiologists and referring clinicians, cumbersome nature of current structured reporting systems made them unpopular amongst their users. Recently, the emerging techniques of deep learning have been widely and successfully applied in many different natural language processing tasks (NLP). However, when adopted in a certain speciﬁc domain, such as radiology, these techniques should be combined with extensive domain knowledge to improve efﬁciency and accuracy. There is, therefore, a critical need to take advantage of clinical NLP and deep learning to fundamentally change the radiology reporting. The long-term goal in this appli- cation is to improve the form, content, and quality of radiology reports and to facilitate rapid generation of radiol- ogy reports with consistent organization and standardized texts. The overall objective is to use radiology-speciﬁc ontology, NLP and computer vision techniques, and deep learning to construct a radiology-speciﬁc knowledge graph, which will then be used to build a reporting system that can assist radiologists to quickly generate struc- tured and standardized text reports. The rationale for this project is that through integration of new clinical NLP technologies, radiology-speciﬁc knowledge graphs, and development of new reporting system, we can build au- tomatous systems with a higher-level understanding of the radiological world. The speciﬁc aims of this project are to: (1) recognize and normalize named entities in radiology reports; (2) construct a radiology-speciﬁc knowledge graph from free-text and images; and (3) build a reporting system that can dynamically adjust templates based on radiologists' prior entries. The research proposed in this application is innovative, in the applicant's opinion, because it combines deep learning, NLP techniques, and domain knowledge in a single framework to construct comprehensive and accurate knowledge graphs that will enhance the workﬂow of the current reporting systems. The proposed research is signiﬁcant because a novel reporting system can expedite radiologists' workﬂow and acquire well-annotated datasets that facilitate machine learning and data science. To develop such a method, the candidate, Dr. Yifan Peng, requires additional training and mentoring in clinical NLP and radiology. During the K99 phase, Dr. Peng will conduct this research as a research fellow at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. He will be mentored by Dr. Zhiyong Lu, a leading text mining and deep learning researcher, and co- mentored by Dr. Ronald M. Summers, a leading radiologist and clinical informatics researcher. This application for the NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) describes a career development plan that will allow Dr. Peng to achieve the career goals of becoming an independent investigator and leader in the study of clinical NLP. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it entails a new strategy to construct a radiology- speciﬁc knowledge graph to facilitate the development of a new reporting system that enables rapid generation of structured radiology reports. The proposed knowledge graph and reporting system will contribute to advancement in understanding of the radiological world, and promise to enhance clinical communication and patient-centric care. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NLM's mission that pertains to applying deep knowledge of clinical terminology and natural language processing to improve clinical data science and health services.",A framework to enhance radiology structured report by invoking NLP and DL:  Models and Applications,10224953,R00LM013001,"['Award ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Communication ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Goals ', ' Health Services ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hybrids ', ' Learning ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Names ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Terminology ', ' North America ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Productivity ', ' Public Health ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resort ', ' Societies ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Voice ', ' Writing ', ' Generations ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Picture Archiving and Communication System ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Development Plans ', ' radiologist ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' impression ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' Nomenclature ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' discovery mining ', ' literature mining ', ' literature searching ', ' text mining ', ' text searching ', ' Address ', ' American College of Radiology ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Ontology ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' lexical ', ' Systems Development ', ' Data Science ', ' Formulation ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' long short term memory ', ' neural network architecture ', ' neural net architecture ', ' knowledge graph ', ' graph knowledge base ', ' graph knowledgebase ', ' ']",NLM,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R00,2021,236549,NY-12
"Scientific Questions: A New Target for Biomedical NLP Project Summary  Natural language processing (NLP) technology is now widespread (e.g. Google Translate) and has several important applications in biomedical research. We propose a new target for NLP: extraction of scientific questions stated in publications. A system that automatically captures and organizes scientific questions from across the biomedical literature could have a wide range of significant impacts, as attested to in our diverse collection of support letters from researchers, journal editors, educators and scientific foundations. Prior work focused on making binary (or probabilistic) assessments of whether a text is hedged or uncertain, with the goal of downgrading such statements in information extraction tasks—not computationally capturing what the uncertainty is about. In contrast, we propose an ambitious plan to identify, represent, integrate and reason about the content of scientific questions, and to demonstrate how this approach can be used to address two important new use cases in biomedical research: contextualizing experimental results and enhancing literature awareness. Contextualizing results is the task of linking elements of genome-scale results to open questions across all of biomedical research. Literature awareness is the ability to understand important characteristics of large, dynamic collections of research publications as a whole. We propose to produce rich computational representations of the dynamic evolution of research questions, and to prototype textual and visual interfaces to help students and researchers explore and develop a detailed understanding of key open scientific questions in any area of biomedical research. Project Narrative The scientific literature is full of statements of important unsolved questions. By using artificial intelligence systems to identify and categorize these questions, the proposed work would help other researchers discover when their findings might address an important question in another scientific area. This work would also make it easier for students, journal editors, conference organizers and others understand where science is headed by tracking the evolution of scientific questions.",Scientific Questions: A New Target for Biomedical NLP,10223438,R01LM013400,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Awareness ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Cues ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Evolution ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Literature ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Phenotype ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Semantics ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Students ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Information Retrieval ', ' Information extraction ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Taxonomy ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Visual ', ' Letters ', ' journal article ', ' news ', ' tool ', ' Scientist ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' Performance ', ' Computer Based Patient Record ', ' Electronic patient record ', ' Electronic-based patient record ', ' Computerized Patient Records ', ' novel ', ' graduate student ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' High Throughput Assay ', ' high throughput screening ', ' Proteomics ', ' discovery mining ', ' literature mining ', ' literature searching ', ' text mining ', ' text searching ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Collection ', ' Ontology ', ' Update ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Text ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' genome wide association study ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' prototype ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' dynamical evolution ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' pharmacovigilance ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2021,453141,CO-06
"Automated Presurgical Language Mapping via Deep Learning for Multimodal Brain Connectivity Project Summary/Abstract Approximately 100,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with a primary brain tumor each year. Neu- rosurgery remains the ﬁrst and most common therapeutic option for these patients with outcomes linked to the extent of tumor resection. However, larger resections also increase the risk for postoperative deﬁcits, particularly in the motor and language areas of the eloquent cortex. Task fMRI (t-fMRI) has emerged as a powerful nonin- vasive tool for preoperative mapping, but these acquisitions are lengthy and cognitively demanding for patients. Moreover, t-fMRI is unreliable if the patient cannot perform the tasks while in the scanner. Our long-term goal is to develop an automated platform for reliable eloquent cortex mapping across a broad patient cohort that comple- ments the existing clinical workﬂow. The overall objective of this proposal is to design and validate new machine learning algorithms that leverage the complementary strengths of resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and diffusion MRI (d-MRI), which are both passive modalities and easy to acquire. Our central hypothesis is that the combined structural-functional connectivity information in these modalities will enable us to localize language functionality in patients with brain tumors. Our innovative strategy uses recent advancements in deep learning to capture com- plex interactions in the rs-fMRI and d-MRI data that collectively deﬁne the language areas. We will evaluate our hypothesis via two speciﬁc aims. In Aim 1 we will develop a graph neural network (GNN) that employs specialized convolutional ﬁlters to capture topological properties of the connectivity data across multiple scales. Our GNN will be trained in a supervised fashion and evaluated against t-fMRI activations and intraoperative electrocortical stimulation. In Aim 2 we will conduct an exploratory analysis to retrospectively link our GNN predictions to post- operative changes in language functionality. Namely, we hypothesize that patients for whom the surgical path intersects our GNN predictions will experience greater deﬁcits across ﬁne-grained language subdomains. We will also assess the prognostic value of our GNN predictions, as compared to other clinical factors. We anticipate the proposed research will have a transformative impact on surgical planning by helping neurosurgeons to plan more targeted and safer surgeries, thus improving patient outcomes and overall quality of care. Project Narrative The proposed research addresses a critical and unmet public health need in managing primary brain tumors by improving the accuracy of eloquent cortex mapping during preoperative planning. The algorithms developed through these efforts will help to streamline the surgical procedures and mitigate the risk for postoperative deﬁcits, towards the ultimate goal of improving both quality of care and long-term clinical outcomes.",Automated Presurgical Language Mapping via Deep Learning for Multimodal Brain Connectivity,10286181,R21CA263804,"['Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anesthesia procedures ', ' Anesthesia ', ' Aphasia ', ' Alogia ', ' Anepia ', ' Logagnosia ', ' Logamnesia ', ' Logasthenia ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Neoplasms ', ' Brain Neoplasia ', ' Brain Tumors ', ' tumors in the brain ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diffusion ', ' Equipment ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Hospitals ', ' Joints ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' central nervous system plasticity ', ' neural plasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' neurosurgery ', ' Patients ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Seeds ', ' Plant Embryos ', ' Plant Zygotes ', ' seed ', ' Sleep ', ' Supervision ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' awake ', ' Individual ', ' Neurosurgeon ', ' neuro-surgeon ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Graph ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Modality ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Primary Brain Tumors ', ' Primary Brain Neoplasms ', ' Property ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Brain region ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Collection ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Monitor ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Behavioral Paradigm ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' independent component analysis ', ' Consumption ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' Network-based ', ' tumor ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' patient population ', ' common treatment ', ' prognostic value ', ' prognostic ability ', ' prognostic power ', ' prognostic utility ', ' cortex mapping ', ' cortical map ', ' cortical mapping ', ' care costs ', ' preservation ', ' Grain ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' multilayer perceptron ', ' ']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,221368,MD-07
"Cognitive and Neural Basis of Functional Communication Deficits in Post-Stroke Aphasia Project Summary/Abstract Aphasia is an impairment of language that is a common consequence of stroke and has serious negative effects on health and well-being. Aphasia diagnosis continues to be organized around a 19th century model of the neural basis of language, but cognitive neuroscience research over the last 15-20 years has converged to a very different model of the cognitive and neural organization of spoken language. This contemporary model provides a precise computational account of the sub-systems that support spoken language, but does not explain how those sub-systems produce functional communication – the outcome that is most important to people with aphasia and to clinicians. The long-term goal of this project is to develop theory-informed, clinically-relevant prognostic tools that combine behavioral and neuroimaging information. The overall objective of this application is to determine the relationships between spoken functional communication impairments of language sub-systems, and neuroanatomical disruption in chronic post-stroke aphasia. The overall project is divided into three specific aims: (1) Determine how spoken functional communication is related to deficits in language sub-systems. We will test how the three key language sub-systems – semantics, phonology, and sentence planning – are related to functional communication in a large sample of individuals with post-stroke aphasia. (2) Identify the lesion correlates of spoken functional communication deficits using lesion-symptom mapping. We will conduct the first LSM study of spoken functional communication using multimodal neuroimaging and machine learning tools to discover robust lesion correlates of spoken functional communication. (3) Develop a prediction model of chronic language sub-system and functional communication deficits based on acute lesion data. Routine clinical neuroimaging data collected in the acute stage (48-72 hours after stroke) will be used to build and evaluate a prediction model of chronic deficits in language sub- systems and functional communication. Upon completion of this project, we will have determined how behavioral deficits and lesion patterns are related to functional communication deficits, and developed a prediction model of such deficits based on acute-stage clinical neuroimaging. This integration of psycholinguistics, neuroanatomy, and functional communication will provide theory-informed, clinically-relevant predictions of communication deficits. This project addresses NIDCD Strategic Priority Area 3 (Improving Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prevention) by developing a neural biomarker of objective diagnosis and prognosis for acquired language impairments. Project Narrative This project will integrate investigate how the cognitive and neural sub-systems that support spoken language work together to allow speakers with language deficits to convey their message. The studies apply machine learning tools to behavioral assessments, neuroimaging, and measures of functional communication in order to reveal how they are related.

"Leveraging linked registry and electronic health records to examine long-term patient outcomes after peripheral vascular intervention"" Leveraging linked registry and electronic health records to examine long-term patient outcomes after peripheral vascular intervention Project Summary/Abstract Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) affects over 200 million people worldwide. Peripheral vascular interventions (PVI) are the most common procedures that are performed to manage PAD. Existing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies of patient outcomes after PVIs all had limited follow-up lengths due to difficulties in long-term data collections. In addition, heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE) for stent placement vs. percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) alone has not been well understood with the current approach of effect modifier assessment. Real-world data (RWD), particularly registries linked with electronic health data (EHR), are useful for studying long-term outcomes after vascular procedures. However, methods for working with multiple data sources and analyzing unstructured text data are still evolving. The proposed research aims to address current evidence gaps in long-term patient outcomes after PVI procedures. This will be facilitated by innovatively apply and refine data linkage, natural language processing (NLP), and effect modifier assessment methods. Specifically, this project will link registry and EHR data to 1) examine long-term major adverse limb events after stent placement vs. PTA alone as well as assess heterogeneity of treatment effect by patient characteristics; 2) develop an NLP pipeline with machine learning methods to analyze unstructured text data and examine long-term efficacy endpoints after stent placement vs. PTA alone, and; 3) establish feasibility and updating requirements for the deployment of the NLP tool for long-term PVI outcome assessment to other institutions. To support the research activities and the transition toward independence, the candidate will undertake the following career development activities during the award period: 1) gaining an in- depth understanding of NLP and machine learning methods; 2) refining data science expertise to integrate EHR into medical device epidemiologic research; 3) strengthening knowledge in current and novel vascular disease treatment; 4) developing and improving skills in grant writing and academic leadership; 5) training in responsible conduct of research. The candidate will be mentored by a team of experts with complementary strengths in surgical and device outcomes research, natural language processing and machine learning, and vascular disease and surgery. The proposed career development and research activities will develop the candidate's skillset and expertise and lead to an R01 level application. The candidate's long-term goal is to become an independent researcher focusing on the development and application of advanced multidisciplinary methods in the evaluation of surgical and device outcomes in the vascular disease area, supporting clinical, patient, and regulatory decision-making. Project narrative The proposed research will evaluate long-term patient outcomes after peripheral vascular interventions for peripheral arterial disease and assess heterogeneity of treatment effect. These will be supported by implementing and advancing data linkage, natural language processing, and effect modifier assessment methods for vascular research. The proposed research is relevant to NIH's mission to foster fundamental knowledge generation and innovative research strategies that will ultimately help protect and improve health.","Leveraging linked registry and electronic health records to examine long-term patient outcomes after peripheral vascular intervention""",10283367,K01HL159315,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Amputation ', ' Balloon Angioplasty ', ' Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty ', ' Transluminal Angioplasty ', ' Transluminal Arterial Dilatation ', ' Award ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitals ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Medical Device ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Stents ', ' Vascular Diseases ', ' Vascular Disorder ', ' blood vessel disorder ', ' vascular dysfunction ', ' vasculopathy ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Outcome Assessment ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Peripheral ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Data Linkages ', ' Record Linkage Study ', ' Fostering ', ' Research Activity ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Informatics ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' patient registry ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Predictive Value ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Update ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Peripheral arterial disease ', ' peripheral artery disease ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' treatment effect ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' electronic structure ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' health data ', ' Data Science ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' Natural Language Processing pipeline ', ' NLP pipeline ', ' multiple data sources ', ' unstructured data ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NHLBI,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,K01,2021,162252,NY-12
"Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Aphasia: Efficacy and Neural Basis PROJECT SUMMARY Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with chronic aphasia in a number of small studies, many of which did not include a control group. Although the treatment appears promising, data to date do not permit an adequate assessment of the utility of the technique. We propose to study the effects of TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy (CILT) in 75 subjects with chronic aphasia. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to TMS with CILT or sham TMS with CILT. One Hz TMS at 90% motor threshold will be delivered to the right inferior frontal gyrus for 20 minutes in 10 sessions over 2 weeks; language therapy will be provided for one hour immediately after the conclusion of each session of TMS. Change from baseline in the Western Aphasia Battery Aphasia Quotient at 6 months after the end of TMS treatment will serve as the primary outcome measure. A secondary aim is to identify anatomic and behavioral predictors of response to treatment. Finally, a third aim is to identify the mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of the treatment using a variety of imaging techniques. Subjects who have no contraindication to the MRI will undergo fMRI imaging prior to and at 6 months after therapy. Using modern network analyses and robust machine learning techniques we will identify changes in the strengths of connections between nodes in the language network to address specific hypotheses regarding the effects of TMS and CILT on brain organization that are associated with beneficial response to treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with aphasia in many small studies, its general clinical utility has not been established.

"Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews Summary ​Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews (​Renewal) Evidence-based Medicine (EBM) aims to inform patient care using all available evidence. Realizing this aim in practice would require access to concise, comprehensive, and up-to-date structured summaries of the evidence relevant to a particular clinical question. Systematic reviews of biomedical literature aim to provide such summaries, and are a critical component of the EBM arsenal and modern medicine more generally. However, such reviews are extremely laborious to conduct. Furthermore, owing to the rapid expansion of the biomedical literature base, they tend to go out of date quickly as new evidence emerges. These factors hinder the practice of evidence-based care. In this renewal proposal, we seek to continue our ground-breaking efforts on developing, evaluating, and deploying novel machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) methods to automate or semi-automate the evidence synthesis process. This will extend our innovative and successful efforts developing RobotReviewer and related technologies under the current grant. Concretely, for this renewal we propose to move from extraction of clinically salient data elements from individual trials to synthesis of these elements across trials. Our first aim is to extend our ML and NLP models to produce (as one deliverable) a publicly available, continuously and automatically updated semi-structured evidence database, comprising extracted data for all evidence, both published and unpublished. Unpublished trials will be identified via trial registries. Taking this up-to-date evidence repository as a starting point, we then propose cutting-edge ML and NLP models that will generate first drafts of evidence syntheses, automatically. More specifically we propose novel neural cross-document summarization models that will capitalize on the semi-structured information automatically extracted by our existing models, in addition to article texts. These models will be deployed in a new version of RobotReviewer, called RobotReviewerLive, intended to be a prototype for “living” systematic reviews. To rigorously evaluate the practical utility of the proposed methodological innovations, we will pilot their use to support real, ongoing, exemplar living reviews. Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews (​Renewal) Narrative We propose novel machine learning and natural language processing methods that will aid biomedical literature summarization and synthesis, and thereby support the conduct of evidence-based medicine (EBM). The proposed models and technologies will motivate core methodological innovations and support real-time, up-to-date, semi-automated biomedical evidence syntheses (“systematic reviews”).

"Identification and Prediction of Peripartum Depression from Natural Language Collected in a Mobile Health App PROJECT SUMMARY Background: Depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period affects up to 15% of US mothers, imposing costs on mother, child, and society. Early detection can significantly reduce the incidence of depression, yet depressive symptoms are often missed during prenatal visits, which tend to focus on maternal and fetal physical health, leaving less time for maternal mental health. Even if mental health is addressed during prenatal care, women may not feel comfortable answering questions that are perceived to be embarrassing or invasive. Failing to detect depression is even more likely during the postpartum period due to infrequent physician visits once the baby has been born. Measurement in the form of daily journals, which can be analyzed using natural language processing, can promote early and more frequent detection of depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Study Aims: 1) Model which dynamic features of language used over time best predict changes in depression status in the pregnancy and postpartum periods, creating phenotypes of depression risk; 2) examine how the language patterns that predict depression differ for African-American and Caucasian women; and 3) identify the relationship between the characteristics of what depressed peripartum women say and their treatment-seeking behavior. Innovation: The proposed research is innovative in its use of high frequency natural language measurements, captured in daily journals using a smartphone app, combined with advances in natural language processing models, to assess the onset and trajectory of depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period. This is the first prospective longitudinal study using natural language collection for risk prediction in a clinical population and the first to: 1) characterize the critical topics women discuss during the peripartum period over time using open-ended journals; 2) evaluate multiple facets of language to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between language and depression; 3) use a longitudinal design approach allowing for optimal modeling of language changes associated with depression onset. Methodology and Expected Results: Monthly depression risk identified from the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. will be collected through the MyHealthyPregnancy smartphone app, a mobile health application developed through close collaboration between decision scientists, clinicians, statisticians, and local peripartum women. A daily journal embedded in the MyHealthyPregnancy app will collect natural language text from the participants for 10 months (from their first prenatal visit through two months postpartum). Using three distinct natural language processing algorithmic approaches, this study will characterize how the natural language used by peripartum women in their daily journal entries is connected to the onset and experience of peripartum depression, as measured through monthly-administered depression scales. Group- based trajectory modeling will then classify women according to the patterns in their depression scores over time. Potential Impact: This work lays the foundation for developing and evaluating real-time interventions that could be deployed at scale to women who are using language that signals high depression risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research will examine how the topics (the people and events mentioned), sentiment (the positive, negative, and neutral affect), and other aspects of language expressed in daily journal entries correspond to diagnostic measures of depression and treatment-seeking in a peripartum clinical population. Psychometric and daily journal entry data will be gathered through an existing smartphone app, MyHealthyPregnancy, which monitors risk and delivers actionable information as part of routine prenatal

"Studying pseudogout using naturallanguage processing and novelimaging approaches Candidate: Dr. Tedeschi is an Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and Associate Physician in the Division of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy’s Section of Clinical Sciences (SCS) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH). She received an MPH from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH). Her 10 first-author manuscripts, two BWH grants, and foundation award exemplify her productivity and commitment to research. She has assembled an experienced team of mentors and collaborators, led by Dr. Daniel Solomon (primary mentor) and Drs. Katherine Liao and Karen Costenbader (co-mentors), to guide her training in natural language processing and machine learning approaches for clinical research, analysis of linked electronic medical record (EMR) and Medicare claims data, and interpretation of advanced imaging modalities. Focused coursework at HSPH and HMS will complement the experience she gains through her proposed studies of pseudogout risk factors and long-term outcomes. Training in dual- energy CT and ultrasound interpretation for crystalline arthritis will be obtained via one-on-one sessions. Her long-term career goal is to become an independent patient-oriented investigator focused on pseudogout. Environment: Dr. Tedeschi has a commitment from her Division for >75% protected time for research and career development activities during the K23 award period. Support from the Division and her primary mentor’s research funds will supplement her salary and project-related expenses. The SCS, a collaborative clinical research group in the Division of Rheumatology, has extensive infrastructure including the VERITY Bioinformatics Core (NIH-P30-AR072577, PI: Solomon) that will provide resources and expertise for the proposed studies. In addition, the BWH Arthritis Center is one of the largest nationally, facilitating subject recruitment, and the BWH Division of Musculoskeletal Imaging has state-of-the-art equipment and expertise applying dual-energy CT in crystalline arthritis. Coursework at HSPH and HMS, adjacent to BWH, will provide training necessary for Dr. Tedeschi’s development into an independent investigator. Research: Dr. Tedeschi’s long-term objective is to prevent and reduce morbidity from pseudogout, an understudied, painful crystalline arthritis that affects 8-10 million Americans. She will use natural language processing and machine learning approaches to enhance an algorithm for identifying pseudogout in EMR data. She will study risk factors for and long-term outcomes in pseudogout, harnessing vast amounts of information contained in Partners HealthCare EMR data and Medicare claims data, and will gain experience working with linked datasets. Dr. Tedeschi will recruit subjects with pseudogout and other types of mono- and oligoarthritis to test and compare the performance of dual-energy CT scanning, musculoskeletal ultrasound, and x-ray for identifying pseudogout. Her proposed K23 projects will lead to manuscripts and data to be leveraged in an R01 application focused on pseudogout during the award period, leading to independence as a patient-oriented investigator. Project Narrative The proposed studies will contribute fundamental knowledge about pseudogout, a common, painful crystalline arthritis for which we have little prognostic information and no targeted treatments. Results from the proposed projects could lead to methods for non-invasive, accurate pseudogout diagnosis, development of preventive strategies for pseudogout, and interventions to reduce cardiovascular disease risk. Future work stemming from the proposed projects may include predictive models of pseudogout flares, identification of serum biomarkers for pseudogout, and development of outcomes measures to be used

"CRCNS: Discovering Computational Principles of Language Processing in the Brain A critical characteristic of human language is our ability to understand multi-word sequences whose meaning is greater than the sum of their parts. Recent work from the PIs of this proposal (Toneva and Wehbe, 2019; Jain and Huth, 2018) and others (Schrimpf et al., 2020a; Caucheteux & King, 2020) has shown that cortical representations of multi-word sequences can be modeled much more accurately than before by using neural network language models, a machine learning technique that has revolutionized the natural language processing (NLP) field (Devlin et al., 2019; Radford et al., 2019). However, under the current paradigm these models must first be trained on separate NLP tasks and only then used to model the brain, creating a guess-and-check cycle that is not guaranteed to converge on the actual computations that humans perform. Here we propose to break this cycle by directly training neural network models to estimate the functions that the brain uses to combine words. To be able to optimally predict fMRI and MEG responses, these models will need to capture the composition principles governing which words the brain attends to, and how information is combined across words. These models will help uncover specific computations underlying language processing in the brain, enable computational testing of neurolinguistic theories, and inspire or directly improve models used in NLP.  Accomplishing these goals, however, will require overcoming one major obstacle. Training neural net- work language models typically requires orders of magnitude more data than existing neuroimaging datasets. To address this issue, one central goal of this proposed project is to collect a very large fMRI and MEG dataset comprising roughly one million words of natural language stimuli. We plan to use the unique dataset and computational modeling framework to address three scientific aims. Aim 1: Create brain activity prediction benchmarks to foster interaction between neuroscience and NLP. Aim 2: Use data-driven models to test existing neurolinguistic theories & develop new accounts of the computations underlying word composition in the brain. Aim 3: Leverage information in different brain areas to help solve computationally defined language tasks.  Successful completion of the proposed work will provide mechanistic insight into language processing, with a computational architecture tracing information flow among brain areas and describing the tasks they perform. Beyond its basic cognitive neuroscience implications, we expect this work will enable better understanding of language impairments and help identify targeted therapies. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Through collecting, analyzing, and disseminating large-scale neuroimaging datasets collected while participants listen to natural, narrative speech, this proposal aims to improve our understanding of the normal function of the language system. Specifically, this work seeks to improve and validate computational models of speech language processing in the human brain.

"Addressing variability in peripheral arterial disease outcomes using machine learning techniques Project Summary/Abstract: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, affecting over eight million Americans, of whom 100,000 a year suffer major amputation. Current guidelines dictate medical treatment and aggressive risk factor modification for all PAD patients, whether symptomatic or not, with revascularization attempts for patients with chronic limb threatening ischemia (CLTI) or lifestyle-limiting claudication. Despite strongly-worded standards of care, variability in PAD outcomes persists. Prior research has demonstrated that some demographic factors such as gender, race, and socioeconomic status are associated with worse PAD care and outcomes even when controlling for comorbidities. It is unknown what specific patient, provider, and healthcare system factors lead to these disparities. Efforts to understand which patients will suffer worse outcomes and disease progression have been hampered by contemporary outcomes research techniques. The majority of PAD outcomes research relies on administrative claims databases, procedural registries, or single center retrospective reviews. While each of these methods has some advantages, none offer the combination of patient- and disease-specific data, information about care provision on a provider and health-system level, and outcomes across a range of possible locations. Furthermore, use of any of these methods at the scale necessary to draw powerful conclusions is prohibitively time- and resource-intensive. The overall objective of this research is to use a novel natural language processing model to build a combined EHR/CMS database and to use that database to predict which PAD patients are at highest risk of poor outcomes with improved power and precision. This proposal contains plans for collaboration with Duke Forge, who bring expertise in natural language processing and machine learning in order to efficiently identify PAD patients within our EHR and efficiently abstract information about them. Once identified, these patients can be linked to their CMS outcomes, allowing for assessment of how patient-, physician-, and healthcare-specific factors affect PAD outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that natural language processing powered by machine learning will permit efficient identification of patients with PAD, thereby facilitating higher-powered and higher-quality investigation into disparities in PAD outcomes. This research will pave the way for future interventions targeting sources of outcome inequality, possibly including access to care, physician adherence to national guidelines, and patient preferences or health literacy. Project Narrative: Peripheral arterial disease affects more than eight million Americans, with over one hundred thousand amputations performed yearly. Despite the prevalence and morbidity of this disease, there is a lack of knowledge about which patients will require amputation, multiple surgeries or hospitalizations, or suffer cardiovascular- related death. This proposal uses natural language processing to improve on current research methodology in order to account for patient-specific, physician-specific, and system-specific factors in peripheral arterial disease care and outcomes.",Addressing variability in peripheral arterial disease outcomes using machine learning techniques,10464976,F32HL151181,"['Affect ', ' Amputation ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Ischemia ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary infarction ', ' heart attack ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart infarction ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Technics ', ' Research Techniques ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Inequality ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' American ', ' cohort ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' ICD-10 ', ' International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) ', ' Provider ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' claudication ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Text ', ' Peripheral arterial disease ', ' peripheral artery disease ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' adjudicate ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' treatment effect ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' care outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' provider adherence ', ' adherence by clinicians ', ' adherence by providers ', ' clinician adherence ', ' clinician compliance ', ' physician adherence ', ' physician compliance ', ' provider compliance ', ' ']",NHLBI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F32,2021,85488,NC-04
"Hippocampal-cortical networks underlying memory retrieval of linguistic knowledge ABSTRACT Language and memory overlap heavily in brain circuitry and in our day-to-day lives. Both are also frequently disrupted in neurological conditions such as temporal lobe epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease. We have a limited understanding of the mechanisms by which cortical language centers integrate with memory circuits; for example, to support the retrieval of linguistic knowledge. This limits our insight into disease pathophysiology and slows the development of more effective therapies for cognitive impairments. This K23 will support an investigation of how language and memory integrate in the human brain, by harnessing unique innovations and resources. First, we will use special high-density grid and depth electrodes to record from many hundreds of local neuronal populations distributed throughout memory and language centers, among patients undergoing intracranial monitoring for refractory epilepsy. Second, to target distinct moments of linguistic-mnemonic integration, we have customized an auditory naming behavioral task that combines controlled yet natural language stimuli with memory retrieval of linguistic knowledge. Third, I will apply state-of-the-art analyses with pattern classifiers and computational linguistics, an approach that could improve the framework of how we understand neural representations of deep language processing. I will first evaluate whether the activity patterns in cortical language centers and the hippocampus reveal neural signatures of dynamic integration during knowledge retrieval, and whether their activity patterns reflect mutual information sufficient to predict the linguistic content of task trials (Aim 1). I will then use electrical stimulation to selectively disrupt neural processing in these regions, to determine if and how they contribute to distinct stages of language and memory integration (Aim 2). This approach will also allow us to probe whether the hippocampus is required for semantic memory, a long-debated question arising from classic literature. My mentorship team has a constellation of expertise aligning with my training plan and the goals of this investigation, including cortical language neurophysiology, hippocampal memory neurophysiology, and investigative neurostimulation. This proposal builds upon my prior expertise in translational intracranial recordings and neural signal processing, and my long-term career goal of understanding and improving treatments for cognitive impairments in epilepsy. I will receive training, coursework, and direct mentorship in skillsets that I will continue to use throughout my scientific career, including language and memory neurophysiology, human neurostimulation, neuroethics, machine learning, computational linguistics, scientific communication, and independent laboratory management. The knowledge and training acquired during this award period will allow me to establish an independent laboratory and emerge as a leader in human intracranial neurophysiology, applying my expertise to unmet needs in epilepsy. NARRATIVE Memory and language functions can be devastatingly impaired by neurological diseases such as temporal lobe epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease. This investigation seeks to understand how the neural circuits that underlie these functions work together to retrieve knowledge from memory, a precious human ability used in our day-to- day lives. This will have important relevance for basic neuroscience, clinical pathophysiology, and the development of future therapeutics for cognitive impairments.",Hippocampal-cortical networks underlying memory retrieval of linguistic knowledge,10226826,K23NS110920,"[""Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Animal Experimentation ', ' Animal Experimental Use ', ' Animal Research ', ' Animals ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cognition ', ' Communication ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electric Stimulation ', ' Electrical Stimulation ', ' electrostimulation ', ' Electrodes ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Temporal Lobe Epilepsy ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Language ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Literature ', ' Memory ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Names ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Semantics ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Inferior frontal gyrus ', ' Inferior Frontal Convolution ', ' Structure of middle temporal gyrus ', ' Middle Temporal Gyrus ', ' Comprehension ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' career ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' awake ', ' Individual ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' cognitive function ', ' Investigation ', ' electrocorticography ', ' Electrocorticogram ', ' Auditory ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Semantic memory ', ' Performance ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' axon signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neurotransmission ', ' memory retrieval ', ' Participant ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Refractory epilepsy ', ' drug-resistant epilepsy ', ' Intractable Epilepsy ', ' Brain region ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Retrieval ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' semantic processing ', ' language processing ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' natural language ', ' neuroethics ', ' Computational Linguistics ', ' signal processing ', ' brain circuitry ', ' ']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2021,200178,CA-12

The topics at the conference range widely but almost always cover all aspects of language processing including phonological processing, lexical-semantic processing, syntactic processing, orthographic processing, bilingualism, computational modeling, non-invasive and invasive brain imaging, language recovery, neuroplasticity, and rehabilitation. In this proposal, we aim to include two special initiatives that will take place during the annual academy of aphasia conference. The first initiative involves a formal mentoring program for young investigators entering the field of aphasia research. In this program, selected student/post-doctoral fellows from interdisciplinary backgrounds who are first authors at the conference are paired with a mentor. This mentor will provide specific feedback about the fellow's presentation and general mentorship to the fellow about research and academic careers. This program is currently occurring as part of the conference and has been growing at the annual meeting with very positive feedback. Additionally, a formal mentoring meeting will allow a structured format for discussion about a career in aphasia research. The second initiative will be a three hour seminar (New Frontiers in Aphasia Research) that covers the background and approach of a state of the art methodology (e.g., fNIRS, graph theoretical metric, machine learning approaches) that has an application to the study of aphasia. These workshops will be recorded and, consequently, uploaded to the academy website/youtube channel for dissemination to aphasia researchers and the public. This workshop will allow conference attendees to understand the conceptual and methodological aspect of a particular scientific approach that can be implemented in their study of aphasia. Given the highly interdisciplinary nature of aphasia research, these workshops will bridge the communication between aphasia researchers and scientists and experts who have developed new approaches to study the brain. This meeting already allows a valuable opportunity for cross-pollination of research ideas and will now provide a platform for the training the next generation of scientists interested in pursuing the nature of aphasia and associated language disorders in adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE Approximately 100,000 individuals suffer from aphasia each year. The academy of aphasia is an organization of clinicians, scientists and practitioners who study this communication disorder and develop interventions to treat individuals with aphasia. The members comprise a very interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, speech and language clinicians, neurologists and neuroscientists. The annual academy of aphasia meeting is the premier venue to share state of the art methodologies for application in the study of aphasia to improve the research in the development of diagnosis and treatment approaches to alleviate aphasia. This conference is also the ideal venue to educate and train the next generation of aphasia researchers who are well trained from a theoretical, technical and clinical standpoint and are committed to expand the impact of research in aphasia.",Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium,10194459,R13DC017375,"['Academy ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Aphasia ', ' Alogia ', ' Anepia ', ' Logagnosia ', ' Logamnesia ', ' Logasthenia ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Chicago ', ' Communication ', ' Communication impairment ', ' Communication Disorders ', ' Communicative Disorders ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Feedback ', ' Fellowship ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Governing Board ', ' Grant ', ' Language ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Language disability ', ' language deficit ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' central nervous system plasticity ', ' neural plasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Production ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychology ', ' Publishing ', ' Reading ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Rest ', ' Speech ', ' Speech Perception ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Videotape ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Clinical ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Neurologist ', ' Recovery ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' bilingual ', ' bilingualism ', ' Pathologist ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Committee Membership ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Transcranial magnetic stimulation ', ' Hour ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' Education and Training ', ' Training and Education ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' phonology ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Graph ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Orthography ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Research Training ', ' Retrieval ', ' Speech Pathologist ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders ', ' NIDCD ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' next generation ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' Non-aphasic ', ' frontier ', ' semantic processing ', ' language processing ', ' lexical ', ' Secure ', ' career networking ', ' career fair ', ' professional networking ', ' speed networking ', ' tenure track ', ' tenure process ', ' improved outcome ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NIDCD,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R13,2021,39939,MA-07
"Improving risk prediction of adverse outcomes in hemodialysis patients by incorporating non-traditional risk factors PROJECT SUMMARY: Candidate: The primary objective of this application is to support Dr. Lili Chan's career development into an independently funded clinical investigator leveraging electronic health records (EHR) and improve risk prediction of adverse outcomes in patients on hemodialysis (HD) by incorporating social determinants of health. To accomplish this goal, Dr. Chan has assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring and advisory team lead by Dr. Steven Coca, Associate Professor of Medicine and Director of Clinical Research in Nephrology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and co-mentor Dr. Peter Kotanko, Adjunct Professor of Medicine at Mount Sinai and Research Director of the Renal Research Institute. Her advisory team consists of Dr. Weng, an expert and in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP), Dr. Alex Federman, who has contributed significantly to the literature on the effects of psychosocial factors on patient care, and Dr. Mazumdar, an expert in biostatistics and risk prediction modeling. Dr. Chan's proposed training plan focuses on four areas, (1) advanced statistical methodology; (2) bioinformatics; (3) patient centered outcomes; and (4) career development. Environment: The Icahn school of Medicine at Mount Sinai is a national leader in research. Specifically the Division of Nephrology has over 30 funded investigators and has successfully mentored five faculty members from K awards to R01 awards. Research: Given the high morbidity and mortality of HD patients, there is a critical need for better risk stratification and identification of high risk groups in order for targeted interventions to be tested. This project utilizes prospectively collected surveys and retrospective chart review of a cohort of diverse patients on chronic HD who receive care from four Renal Research Institute and six Mount Sinai Health System hemodialysis units located throughout New York City. The Specific Aims of the research are: (1) to determine the association between domains of social determinants of health and hospitalizations using survey research methods; (2) to identify social determinants of health in an accurate manner using natural processing language; and (3) to create risk prediction models for hospitalization among patients on HD utilizing both standard measures and social determinants of health using standard statistical methods and machine learning. This research leverages novel computational methods to examine the association of social determinants of health and hospitalizations in HD patients and incorporates SDOH into risk prediction models which will allow for identification of high risk HD patients for inclusion in future intervention trials. The results of this proposal sets the foundation for future R01 studies validating these findings in external data sets and testing the utility of EHR integrated clinical decision tools on reducing hospitalizations, readmissions, and mortality. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patients on hemodialysis have high rates of hospitalizations. Yet, social determinants of health (economic instability, education, neighborhood and built environment, social and community context, and health and healthcare access), which have previously been demonstrated to be associated with hospitalization in hemodialysis patients, are not easily identified and used in research. We plan to identify these factors using prospective surveys and natural language processing software on electronic health records, where these factors are routinely documented, and add these factors to standard clinical factors in complex machine learning models to identify patients at higher risk for hospitalization, and in the process train Dr. Lili Chan into an independent clinical investigator in the field of “big data” research in nephrology.",Improving risk prediction of adverse outcomes in hemodialysis patients by incorporating non-traditional risk factors,10127066,K23DK124645,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Appointment ', ' Award ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Coca ', ' Erythroxylon ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Hemodialysis ', ' Hemodialyses ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Maintenance ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity -

"Fine-grained spatial information extraction for radiology reports ABSTRACT Automated biomedical image classification has seen enormous improvements in performance over recent years, particularly in radiology. However, the machine learning (ML) methods that have achieved this remarkable performance often require enormous amounts of labeled data for training. An increasingly accepted means of acquiring this data is through the use of natural language processing (NLP) on the free-text reports associated with an image For example, take the following brain MRI report snippet:  There is evidence of left parietal encephalomalacia consistent with known history of prior stroke. Small  focal area of hemosiderin deposition along the lateral margins of the left lateral ventricle. Here, the associated MRI could be labeled for both Encephalomalacia and Hemosiderin. NLP methods to automatically label images in this way have been used to create several large image classification datasets However, as this example demonstrates, radiology reports often contain far more granular information than prior NLP methods attempted to extract. Both findings in the above example mention their anatomical location, which linguistically is referred to as a spatial grounding, as the location anchors the finding in a spatial reference. Further, the encephalomalacia finding is connected to the related diagnosis of stroke, while the hemosiderin finding provides a morphological description (small focal area). This granular information is important for image classification, as advanced deep learning methods are capable of utilizing highly granular structured data. This is logical, as for instance a lung tumor has a slightly different presentation than a liver tumor. If an ML algorithm can leverage both the coarse information (the general presentation of a tumor) while also recognizing the subtle granular differences, it can find an optimal balance between specificity and generalizability. From an imaging perspective, this can also be seen as a middle ground between image-level labels (which are cheap but require significant data for training—a typical dataset has thousands of images or more) and segmentation (which is expensive to obtain, but provides better training data—a typical dataset has 40 to 200 images), as the fine-grained spatial labels correspond to natural anatomical segments. Our fundamental hypothesis in this project is that if granular information can be extracted from radiology reports with NLP, this will improve downstream radiological image classification when training on a sufficiently large dataset. For radiology, the primary form of granularity is spatial (location, shape, orientation, etc.), so this will be the focus of our efforts. We further hypothesize that these NLP techniques will be generalizable to most types of radiology reports. For the purpose of this R21-scale project, however, we will focus on three distinct types of reports with different challenges: chest X-rays (one of the most-studied and largest-scale image classification types), extremity X-rays (which offer different findings than chest X-rays), and brain MRIs (which present a different image modality and the additional complexity of three dimensions). NARRATIVE This project is interested in developing natural language processing (NLP) methods for better understanding the spatial relationships described in the free text data within radiology reports found in electronic health record (EHR) systems. We will (i) develop an ontology, (ii) manually create a dataset for training NLP methods, (iii) develop automatic NLP methods compatible the ontology and corpus, and (iv) evaluate automatic image classification methods that use the output of the NLP system as image labels.",Fine-grained spatial information extraction for radiology reports,10116379,R21EB029575,"['Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Encephalomalacia ', ' Cerebromalacia ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Goals ', ' Hemosiderin ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Liver neoplasms ', ' Hepatic Neoplasms ', ' hepatic neoplasia ', ' hepatic neoplasm ', ' hepatic tumor ', ' liver tumor ', ' Lung Neoplasms ', ' Lung Tumor ', ' Pulmonary Neoplasms ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Research ', ' Specificity ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Thoracic Radiography ', ' CXR ', ' chest X ray ', ' chest Xray ', ' chest radiography ', ' lung radiography ', ' radiographic chest image ', ' radiographic lung image ', ' thoracic radiogram ', ' thorax radiography ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' X-Ray Radiation ', ' X-ray ', ' Xray ', ' Information Retrieval ', ' Information extraction ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' lateral ventricle ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Lateral ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' Trust ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Parietal ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Location ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' bio-imaging ', ' biomedical imaging ', ' bioimaging ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Ontology ', ' Text ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' scale up ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' spatial relationship ', ' tumor ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' radiological imaging ', ' radiologic imaging ', ' Grain ', ' deep learning ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' structured data ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R21,2021,195000,TX-09
"The When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L): Joint consideration of developmental patterning and neural substrates for enhancing earlyidentification of language impairment PROJECT SUMMARY  Primary language impairment (PLI) begins early in life and affects 6-8% of children. Language intervention is maximally effective the earlier it is delivered. However, normative variation in language acquisition across toddlerhood (here, 24-36 months) contributes to a high rate of false positives, impeding accurate identification of PLI prior to late preschool age. The proposed study introduces a novel, theoretically- grounded, neurodevelopmental framework designed to generate a sensitive and specific model of toddler PLI risk. Innovations introduced in this developmentally-sensitive, translational approach include: (1) a developmental precursor model using state-of-the-art methods to characterize multiple features and growth patterns of toddler emergent language patterns, within a large community sample; (2) incorporating EEG/ERP neural biomarkers of language and transactional synchrony into PLI predictive models; and (3) considering emergent mental health risk. Mental health risk is captured via multi-method measures of irritability, a developmentally meaningful marker of risk for internalizing and externalizing problems that are common correlates of PLI. The proposed When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L) will capitalize on the team's existed funded study of 350 infants (50% irritable and 50% non irritable) (R01MH107652, Wakschlag, PI) and enrich it via recruitment of a new sub-sample of 200 late talking toddlers. This will yield a large and diverse sample of 550 24 month olds, followed to age 54 months (when PLI can be reliably evaluated). The key predictor will be toddler emergent language patterns measured via language skill, language processing, and corollary neural biomarkers. The central outcome is primary language impairment (PLI) status at preschool age, assessed via clinical gold standard measures. Key risk modifiers are distal and proximal features of the transactional language environment, and longitudinal patterns of irritability.  SPECIFIC AIMS: Aim 1. Specify the contribution of language skills, processing, neural biomarkers, and their growth to early PLI prediction. Hypotheses: 1a. Language skills, processing, and neural biomarkers will each contribute incrementally to PLI prediction. 1b. Considering longitudinal patterns will enhance prediction. Aim 2. Identify the distal risk- and proximal protective- features of the transactional language environment that provide greatest explanatory power for individual differences in PLI. Hypothesis 2: Family history and poor parental language ability will increase PLI risk, and features of parental input, and behavioral and neural synchrony will decrease PLI risk. Aim 3. Examine the mutual influences of toddler irritability, proximal language environment, and emergent language patterns on PLI pathways. Hypothesis 3: A model specifying these reciprocal influences over time will sharpen PLI prediction beyond variance explained by their individual influences. Aim 4. Evaluate feasibility of a clinical algorithm for earlier PLI risk identification. We will use machine learning approaches to generate a sensitive/specific, feasible clinical model building on Aims 1-3. PROJECT NARRATIVE Primary language impairment (PLI) emerges early and is responsive to intervention; however, identification in toddlers is not currently possible because of the high rate of false positives reflecting transient language delays. We use a novel, theoretically-grounded, neurodevelopmental approach to generate earlier, more accurate identification of toddler risk for persistent PLI via: (a) multi-faceted, longitudinal assessment of toddler emergent language patterns; (b) detailed consideration of the transactional language environment; and (c) accounting for emergent health risk in predictive models. Earlier, reliable identification of toddlers at highest risk for PLI will optimize early intervention to prevent developmentally- cascading effects.",The When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L): Joint consideration of developmental patterning and neural substrates for enhancing earlyidentification of language impairment,10105196,R01DC016273,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Child Behavior ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Infant ', ' Joints ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' Language Development ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' language acquisition ', ' language learning ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Language disability ', ' language deficit ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' central nervous system plasticity ', ' neural plasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' Parents ', ' Productivity ', ' Public Health ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' pre-k ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' preschool ', ' Standardization ', ' Syndrome ', ' Time ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Distal ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Individual ', ' Family history of ', ' Family Medical History ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Measurement ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' eye tracking ', ' visual tracking ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' Toddler ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Risk Marker ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' brain behavior ', ' language processing ', ' translational approach ', ' translation strategy ', ' translational strategy ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' standard measure ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' model building ', ' language impairment ', ' recruit ', ' individual variation ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variability ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIDCD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,653332,IL-07
"AI/ML-Readiness for Neuroimaging of Language Project Summary/Abstract Conceptual or semantic knowledge refers to information about objects, actions, relations, self, culture, and includes meanings of words and phrases. The use of this knowledge is pervasive and automatic in daily life. Everyday activities such as communication, recognition and use of objects, social interactions, and decision making are crucially reliant on conceptual knowledge. Impairment of this complex and widely distributed system has serious consequences for quality of life. Several neurological and psychiatric disorders are associated with the impairment of this system, including stroke with aphasia, dementias, temporal lobe epilepsy, schizophrenia, and autism. Understanding the structure and organization of this system, and the specific ways it is disrupted in these individuals, is critical for developing better treatments and rehabilitation strategies. The goal of this research is to understand the structure and use of this information, its neural basis, and the ways in which it can be impaired by neuropathology. This project pertains to three neuroimaging datasets — two functional MRI and one from stroke survivors — that speak to the neural basis of concepts and language processing in the brain. We aim to transform these data and associated metadata to a “machine learning ready” format and make them easily accessible. This will enable application of powerful modern machine learning techniques, such as Deep Learning, for their analysis. We expect that these analyses will shed new light on the organization and function of this core semantic region in the healthy and impaired brain. Project Narrative Understanding how conceptual information is organized, represented in the brain, and affected by neuropathology is a major focus of research, as it has direct relevance to many neurological disorders. This supplement aims to make data from three neuroimaging datasets relating to conceptual processing “machine learning ready.” We expect that application of Deep Learning to these rich datasets will result in substantial new insights into the neural basis of language, and be valuable for understanding and treating language disorders.",AI/ML-Readiness for Neuroimaging of Language,10412576,R01DC017162,"['Affect ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Aphasia ', ' Alogia ', ' Anepia ', ' Logagnosia ', ' Logamnesia ', ' Logasthenia ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Distributed Systems ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Temporal Lobe Epilepsy ', ' frontal lobe ', ' frontal cortex ', ' Goals ', ' Language ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Language disability ', ' language deficit ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' Motor Cortex ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Noise ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Patients ', ' Psycholinguistics ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Semantics ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' angular gyrus ', ' Structure of middle temporal gyrus ', ' Middle Temporal Gyrus ', ' Anterior ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Lesion ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Semantic memory ', ' Inferior ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' phrases ', ' Structure ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' axon signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neurotransmission ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Participant ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Property ', ' social cognition ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' neuropathology ', ' Complex Extracts ', ' Crude Extracts ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Symptoms ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' stroke recovery ', ' Impairment ', ' semantic processing ', ' language processing ', ' lexical ', ' rehabilitation strategy ', ' rehab strategy ', ' parent grant ', ' treatment strategy ', ' language comprehension ', ' comprehending language ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' open data ', ' open science ', ' open-source data ', ' stroke survivor ', ' FAIR principles ', ' FAIR data ', ' FAIR guiding principles ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable ', ' deep learning ', ' feature selection ', ' support vector machine ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R01,2021,287390,SC-06
"Curation at scale: Integrating AI into community curation Project Summary Biological knowledgebases are a critical resource for researchers and accelerate scientific discoveries by providing manually curated, machine-readable data collections. However, the aggregation and manual curation of biological data is a labor-intensive process that relies almost entirely on professional biocurators. Two approaches have been advanced to help with this problem: natural language processing (NLP; text mining (TM) and machine learning (ML)) and engagement of researchers (community curation). However, neither of these approaches alone is sufficient to address the critical need for increased efficiency in the biocuration process. Our solution to these challenges is an NLP-enhanced community curation portal, Author Curation to Knowledgebase (ACKnowledge). The ACKnowledge system, currently implemented for the C. elegans literature, couples statistical methods and text mining algorithms to enhance community curation of research articles. We propose to strengthen and expand ACKnowledge by including other species into our pipeline, incorporating more sophisticated machine learning models, and presenting sentence-level entity and concept extraction for more detailed author curation. In addition, we will develop an Author Curation Portal (ACP) to allow authors to easily upload and curate their own documents. Taken together, these enhancements will allow us to maximize community curation efforts by leveraging author expertise in multiple areas of biology, while at the same time supporting authors with as much AI-assisted curation as possible. This reciprocal interaction will improve not only the content of knowledgebases, but the AI methods themselves, as we will receive valuable feedback on our models. By developing an Author Curation Portal, we will further empower authors to participate in the curation process and alert knowledgebases to key information that can, and should, be readily discoverable in accordance with FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles. Project Narrative The pace at which biological knowledge is published in the scientific literature far surpasses the ability of professional biocurators to collate and annotate such knowledge in a timely fashion. However, knowledgebases are a critical component of biological research whose utility depends on prompt entry of new data. Combining the dual benefits of text mining and community curation, the proposed ACKnowledge system, readily generalized, presents a novel approach to aiding curation by guiding authors to efficiently and accurately annotate their papers, thus quickly and reliably adding new information to knowledgebases.",Curation at scale: Integrating AI into community curation,10344771,R01LM013871,"['Algorithms ', ' Biology ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Couples ', ' Data Collection ', ' Feedback ', ' Gold ', ' Literature ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Microbiology ', ' Names ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Paper ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Time ', ' Generations ', ' Caenorhabditis elegans ', ' C elegans ', ' C. elegans ', ' C.elegans ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Ingestion ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Speed ', ' member ', ' Bypass ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Readability ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' discovery mining ', ' literature mining ', ' literature searching ', ' text mining ', ' text searching ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' computer aided ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Coupling ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' biological research ', ' learning engagement ', ' dashboard ', ' FAIR principles ', ' FAIR data ', ' FAIR guiding principles ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable ', ' data submission ', ' data deposition ', ' Infrastructure ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' WormBase ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' genome resource ', ' ']",NLM,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,355938,CA-27
"Exploring the brain basis of rhythm in individuals with aphasia PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of this proposal is to characterize the neural substrates underlying rhythm abilities and the relationship with language profiles in individuals with aphasia. Aphasia is an acquired communication disorder resulting from damage to language regions of the brain, with stroke as the leading cause. Currently, over 2 million individuals in the United States are living with aphasia. Aphasia is notoriously difficult to treat and patients exhibit significant individual variability in recovery trajectories and in what therapeutic elements work best in aiding such recovery. Speech-language pathologists frequently use rhythmic elements (e.g., tapping to a beat) in the clinic in order to facilitate speech output. However, there is a lack of a deep and systematic empirical assessment of rhythm in aphasia at both a behavioral and neural level. Our first aim is to characterize the neural basis of individual differences in rhythm abilities in individuals with chronic, post-stroke aphasia. To do this, we will administer a comprehensive battery of rhythm perception and production tasks to a large cohort of individuals with aphasia and age-matched controls. We will then employ multivariate lesion-symptom mapping, a machine-learning methodology for identifying brain-behavior relationships, to determine which brain regions are associated with rhythm processing in aphasia. We hypothesize that individuals who have damage to brain regions important for rhythm, including the basal ganglia or the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG), will exhibit the greatest impairments in rhythm. Critically, the LIFG is a core language region typically damaged in post-stroke, non-fluent aphasia. Motivated by robust evidence for associations between rhythm and language across cognitive, neural, and behavioral domains, we will assess the relationship between rhythm and language measures in aphasia in our second aim. We predict that individuals with higher rhythm abilities will have higher language scores, particularly on measures of connected speech. This mentored training award will provide the applicant with training in advanced neural and behavioral data analysis techniques and expertise in large-scale project management with a patient cohort. With significant and timely clinical relevance, our proposal will address vital gaps in the literature by taking an individual differences approach to understanding the relationship between rhythm, the brain, and language in aphasia. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rhythmic elements (e.g., tapping to a beat) are used frequently by speech-language pathologists to facilitate speech output in individuals with aphasia, despite very little empirical and mechanistic groundwork in this area. This proposal aims to characterize the neural substrates underlying rhythm abilities, and the relationship with language profiles, in individuals with chronic, post-stroke aphasia. The proposed experiments, which make critical links between rhythm, the brain, and language, will provide new knowledge for understanding individual differences in rhythm in aphasia and informing future precision medicine approaches.",Exploring the brain basis of rhythm in individuals with aphasia,10386555,F31DC020112,"['Literature ', ' Methodology ', ' Music ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Production ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Speech ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Inferior frontal gyrus ', ' Inferior Frontal Convolution ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' infancy ', ' infantile ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' brain damage ', ' brain-injured ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Pathologist ', ' Empirical Research ', ' Knowledge ', ' Auditory ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' melodic intonation therapy ', ' Brain scan ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Acquired Communication Disorders ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' K01 Award ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Program ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Motor ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Cognitive ', ' therapy outcome ', ' therapeutic outcome ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' post stroke ', ' after stroke ', ' poststroke ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Impairment ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' brain behavior ', ' stem ', ' therapy development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' preservation ', ' individual variation ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variability ', ' stroke-induced aphasia ', ' aphasia due to stroke ', ' aphasia following stroke ', ' poststroke aphasia ', ' stroke aphasia ', ' stroke survivor with aphasia ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Alpha Rhythm ', ' α Rhythm ', ' Aphasia ', ' Alogia ', ' Anepia ', ' Logagnosia ', ' Logamnesia ', ' Logasthenia ', ' Basal Ganglia ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communication impairment ', ' Communication Disorders ', ' Communicative Disorders ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Control Groups ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' ']",NIDCD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,30787,TN-05
"Longitudinal neuroimaging and neurocognitive assessment of risk and protective factors across the schizophrenia spectrum ABSTRACT  The parent R01 project is a longitudinal study examining risk and protective factors in the schizophrenia (SZ) spectrum—from healthy controls (HCs) to individuals with schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) to recent-onset SZ patients (80 per group)—using MRI and neurocognitive approaches. It tests a neurobiological model which posits that individuals with SPD—an intermediate phenotype—have protective factors against developing threshold psychosis, such as preservation of frontal lobe and less severe temporal lobe abnormalities compared to SZ that lead to milder cognitive and social impairments. Examining natural language processing (NLP) as proposed in this supplement is in line with the scope and aims of the parent R01 project and may inform the key neurobiological model being tested. Moreover, examining NLP using novel measures of semantics and syntax in association with measures from the parent R01 of frontal and temporal white matter integrity/connectivity assessed with diffusion tensor imaging and cognitive domains such as processing speed and working memory is innovative.  Speech and language provide a rich source of data on human thought, including semantic and emotional content, semantic coherence (i.e. flow of meaning), and syntactic structure and complexity (i.e. usage of parts of speech). There is a critical gap in our understanding of the linguistic mechanisms that underlie thought disorder in SZ spectrum. The use of automated linguistic analytic methods has been limited to only a few studies focused on discriminating SZ patients from HCs and predicting psychosis.  Together with our colleagues with expertise in NLP at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, we will use advanced computational speech analytic approaches to identify the linguistic basis of language production along a spectrum from normal to thought disordered. We will use optimal interviewing techniques1 to obtain open-ended 30-45 minute narratives from the large (N = 240) English-speaking sample in the parent R01 study, with a range of language disturbances across the spectrum ranging from none/subtle to severe. NLP techniques including Latent Semantic Analysis2 (LSA) and part-of-speech (POS) tagging3,4 will be conducted using artificial intelligence to examine semantic and syntactic language features to include in our overall neurobiological model. These analyses yield fine-grained indices of speech and language that may more accurately capture thought disorder.  Three specific aims will assess (1) semantic coherence in language production using LSA2 and examine its association with positive symptoms and functional impairment across the spectrum; (2) syntactic complexity in language production using POS tagging3,4 and measure acoustic features to examine their association with negative symptoms and functional impairment; and (3) the relationship between language and speech features (semantic, syntactic, and acoustic) with putative white matter integrity assessed using diffusion tensor imaging. PROJECT NARRATIVE Speech and language provide a rich source of data on human thought, including semantic and emotional content, semantic coherence (i.e. flow of meaning), and syntactic structure and complexity (i.e. usage of parts of speech).

"Automating Delirium Identification and Risk Prediction in Electronic Health Records Abstract. Delirium, or acute confusional state, affects 30-40% of hospitalized older adults, with the added cost of care estimated to be up to $7 billion. Although originally conceptualized as a transient disorder, delirium is now recognized to have significant consequences, including increased risk of death, functional decline, and long-term cognitive impairment. As up to 75% cases are not recognized by providers, there is an urgent need for additional methods to identify delirium for clinical and research purposes, and to stratify patients based on delirium risk. In this proposal, we present a novel approach to the identification of delirium based on large-scale data mining (i.e., pattern recognition) algorithms using machine learning and natural language processing applied to electronic health record (EHR) data, which will automate chart-based determination of delirium status and risk prediction. We will combine these algorithms with data collected through our recently implemented Virtual Acute Care for Elders (ACE) quality improvement project, which institutes delirium screening once per shift by nursing staff for all individuals over age 65 admitted to the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Hospital. This unprece- dented volume of data will allow us to achieve the necessary sample sizes for effective training and validation of our data mining algorithms. Data mining algorithms that discover patterns of associations in data, rather than testing predetermined hypotheses, are well suited to application in large-scale algorithms for identification of delirium. Using our Virtual ACE and hospital EHR data, we will be able to evaluate more than 10,000 individual features (e.g., text words and phrases, laboratory and other diagnostic tests, concurrent medical conditions) as- sociated with delirium, which will be classified as risk factors for delirium, as signs, symptoms, and descriptors of delirium itself, and as complications and consequences of delirium, based on expert consensus. We will then use these features to develop rules for identification of delirium in the EHR, as well as risk prediction models that can be integrated into the EHR to provide individualized assessments of delirium risk. This study will lay the foundation for methods of automated delirium identification and risk prediction in healthcare settings that are unable to implement the screening by providers done in our Virtual ACE, as well as for large-scale epidemiological investigations of delirium using EHR data, expanding the current armamentarium for studying this common and debilitating disorder. Project Narrative. Delirium, or acute confusional state, affects up to 7 million hospitalized older adults annu- ally and is associated with long-term declines in cognition and function, but is not recognized by providers in up to 75% of cases. The growth of electronic health records offers a unique opportunity to improve recognition of delir- ium, as methods for identifying delirium based on chart review by clinicians have been developed but are time- and resource-intensive. In this secondary data analysis, we will examine methods for automating delirium recog- nition and risk prediction in electronic health records using machine learning and natural language processing computer algorithms, which in turn will lead to improved care for this serious but often overlooked disorder.",Automating Delirium Identification and Risk Prediction in Electronic Health Records,10091381,R01AG060993,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Alabama ', ' Algorithms ', ' Automation ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cognition ', ' Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Delirium ', ' delirious ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Foundations ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Institutes ', ' Institutionalization ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Staff ', ' nursing personnel ', ' Patients ', ' Reference Standards ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' ROC Curve ', ' ROC Analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic curve ', ' Signs and Symptoms ', ' Diagnostic Findings ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Logistics ', ' Sample Size ', ' Descriptor ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' 65+ years old ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' old age ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' phrases ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' validation studies ', ' Prevention ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' model development ', ' Ally ', ' Provider ', ' ward ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Measurable ', ' Cognitive ', ' Long-Term Care for Elderly ', ' elder care ', ' longterm care for elderly ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' functional decline ', ' decline in function ', ' decline in functional status ', ' functional status decline ', ' virtual ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' screening ', ' confusion assessment method ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' patient stratification ', ' stratified patient ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' high dimensionality ', ' care costs ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' risk prediction model ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' acute care ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2021,376860,AL-07
"Large scale clinical and economic impact analysis of potentially malignant incidental findings in radiology reports Abstract Unexpected findings, or incidentalomas, are increasing dramatically with the growth in the use of imaging technology within healthcare organizations. Incidentalomas may indicate significant health problems, such as malignancy in the medium or long term. However, they also may lead to overinvestigation, unnecessary radiation exposure, overtreatment, substantial downstream expenditures, and patient anxiety. Several systematic reviews have explored the prevalence and outcomes of incidentalomas. These studies used inconsistent and often inappropriate synthesis methods, commonly only focusing on one imaging scan or organ in a very limited number of patients. As a result, there is need for large-scale study of incidentalomas that can inform their follow up and guide efforts to optimize health outcomes. To address this need, we propose to build natural language processing (NLP) approaches to identify cancer-related incidentalomas reported in radiology reports (Aim 1) and to create the first large-scale incidentaloma database covering over half-a-million patients (Aim 2). Our research dataset will contain radiology reports, clinical notes containing imaging orders, as well as structured data such as demographic information (e.g., age) and diagnoses codes of patients who received radiologic imaging tests in University of Washington Medical Center (UWMC), Harborview Medical Center (HMC), Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA), and Northwest Hospital and Medical Center (NWMC) between 2007-2019. Our patient population will be linked to Hutchinson Institute for Cancer Outcomes Research (HICOR) data repository for detailed cancer outcomes and claims data. The created database will be used for clinical and economic analysis of incidentalomas (Aim 3). We will (1) evaluate the concordance between radiologists' documentation of incidentaloma follow-up and established clinical guidelines for thyroid, lung, adrenal, kidney, liver, and pancreas incidentalomas, (2) determine risk of subsequent cancer diagnosis and median survival for each category of incidentaloma, and (3) determine the incremental cost associated with follow-up imaging in patients with incidentalomas. All models and their implementations produced during the execution of this project will be shared with the community as open source. Additionally, the de-identified incidentaloma database will be made available to the research community under a data use agreement. By identifying risk factors for cancer diagnosis and death for common incidental findings, we will be able to provide critical information for future clinical practice guideline development and appropriate use criteria. We assembled a highly interdisciplinary team of experts in NLP, medical informatics, radiology, oncology, health outcomes, and health economics to ensure the successful completion of the proposed project. Project Narrative Incidentalomas may indicate significant health problems, such as malignancy to the patient in the short or medium term, but also may lead to overtreatment, which comes with substantial downstream expenditures as well as patient anxiety.

"Studying exceptional treatment non-responders and genetics to predict treatment response in rheumatoid arthritis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT A major challenge in caring for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is determining the optimal therapy. Several effective biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) are available for RA, reflecting both advances in therapy, and the heterogeneity of RA; subsets of patients respond while others do not. Prior studies focused on patients with a good response to tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi), the most common bDMARD, with limited success in finding predictors that can be used in clinical care. This proposal seeks to address that gap in knowledge by taking a different direction. The objective of this study is to focus on exceptional bDMARD non-responders, defining and characterizing patients who have been on ≥3 classes of bDMARDs for RA. We will test whether data available in clinical electronic health record data (EHR) or genomic data can identify exceptional non-responders from TNFi responders. In Aim 1, we leverage data from an EHR cohort of ~16K RA patients to determine clinical factors associated with exceptional non-response using traditional epidemiologic approaches. As well, we will apply approaches using machine learning and topic modeling that will enable us to evaluate the predictiveness of a broader range of features. Examples of features include billing codes, prescriptions, and medical concepts extracted from text notes using natural language processing. In Aim 2, we will test whether RA genetic risk factors available in a subset of patients in Aim 1, and those of other inflammatory arthritides, e.g. axial spondyloarthropathy, can predict exceptional non- response to bDMARD therapy. As part of aim 2, we will also incorporate any predictive clinical factors identified in Aim 1 through the traditional or topic modeling approach. The overarching hypothesis is that the exceptional non-responders may be less “RA-like” than patients who respond to TNFi, with fewer RA genetic risk alleles and classic RA features from the narrative notes. This definition provides a new way to sub- phenotype RA, focusing on those that will have a poor response to therapy. This study is significant because a screen will be helpful not only in the clinic but can also identify patients to target for future studies of novel drug targets. This approach is innovative because it considers contemporary data where patients now have more “opportunity” to fail 3 classes of bDMARDs, where in the past there were only a limited number available. These data will be examined both using traditional epidemiologic models and newer approaches such as topic modeling that can integrate a broader range of data types. Finally, this proposal is designed to anticipate a time when patients will come for their visit with genetic data as part of their medical record. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rheumatoid arthritis is the most common autoimmune joint disease worldwide. In line with NIAMS’ mission to conduct research in the treatment of arthritis, this proposal will investigate approaches using recent data and state-of-the-art approaches to improve RA management.

Such admissions may be discordant with patient preferences and/or represent a low-value allocation of health system resources. To anticipate such admissions, existing clinical prediction models in this field typically produce an “all-cause” risk estimate which, even if accurate, overlooks the actionable mechanisms behind  admission risk and therefore fails to identify a prescribed response. This limitation may explain the only modest – at best – reductions in hospital admissions and readmissions seen in most intervention bundles that have been tested in this population. An opportunity exists, therefore, to predict hospitalization risk while simultaneously identifying patient phenotypes (i.e. some constellation of social, demographic, clinical, and other characteristics) for which known preventive interventions exist. The proposed study seeks to overcome these limitations and capitalize on this opportunity by (1) conducting semi-structured interviews with hospitalized patients with CLDs, and their caregivers and clinicians, to directly identify modifiable risks and their associated phenotypes driving hospital  admissions; (2) using natural language processing techniques (NLP) to build classification models that will leverage nuanced narrative, social, and clinical information in the unstructured text of clinical encounter notes to identify patients with these phenotypes; and (3) building risk prediction model focused on actionable phenotypes with a wide-array of traditional regression and machine learning approaches while also incorporating large numbers of predictor variables from text data and accounting for time-varying trends. The candidate's preliminary work using basic NLP techniques to significantly improve the discrimination of clinical prediction models in an inpatient population has motivated this methodologic approach. The rising burden and costs of hospitalizations associated with CLDs, and the increasing attention from federal payers, highlights the critical nature of this work. Completion of this research will build upon the candidate's past training, which includes a Masters of Science in Health Policy Research obtained with NHLBI T32 support, and will provide the experience, education, and mentorship to allow the candidate to become a fully independent investigator. Based on the candidate's tailored training plan, he will acquire advanced skills in mixed-methods research, NLP, and trial design all through coursework, close  mentoring and supervision, and direct practice. The skills will position him ideally to submit successful R01s testing the deployment of the proposed clinical prediction models in real-world settings. The candidate's primary mentor, collaborators, and advisors will ensure adherence to the proposed timeline and goals and provide a  supportive environment for him to develop an independent research career testing the real-world deployment of clinical prediction models to reduce low-value and preference-discordant care for patients with CLDs. Project Narrative Every year many people living with chronic lung diseases are admitted to the hospital despite the fact that some of these admissions may have been prevented with early identification and intervention prior to the hospitalization. Previous attempts at preventing such hospitalizations have been limited by their ability to both accurately identify those at risk, and because most risk models do not provide a reason for the likely admission. The proposed work draws directly on the experiences of patients with chronic lung diseases who are admitted to a hospital, and then uses cutting edge statistical and computer science techniques to use information in the electronic health record to accurately predict the risk and the likely reason for future hospital admissions.",Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify potentially preventable hospital admissions among outpatients with chronic lung diseases,10134412,K23HL141639,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Attention ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Interview ', ' Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease ', ' COPD ', ' Chronic Obstruction Pulmonary Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Palliative Care ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' comfort care ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' TimeLine ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Interstitial Lung Diseases ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Hospitalization cost ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Early Intervention ', ' instrument ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' computer science ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Chronic lung disease ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' model development ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' end-of-life ', ' end of life ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Master of Science ', ' Policy Research ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' intervention for prevention ', ' prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' preventive intervention ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Text ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' administrative database ', ' administrative data base ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' modifiable risk ', ' malleable risk ', ' discrete data ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' trial design ', ' supportive environment ', ' enthusiastic atmosphere ', ' enthusiastic environment ', ' supportive atmosphere ', ' risk prediction model ', ' statistical learning ', ' structured data ', ' unstructured data ', ' clinical encounter ', ' clinical center ', ' Home ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K23,2021,173801,PA-03
"Natural Language Processing and Automated Speech Recognition to Identify Older Adults with Cognitive Impairment Project Summary The purpose of this proposal is to develop two strategies, natural language processing (NLP) and automated speech analysis (ASA), to enable automated identification of patients with cognitive impairment (CI), from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (ADRD) in clinical settings. The number of older adults in the United States with MCI and ADRD is increasing and yet the ability of clinicians and researchers to identify them at scale has advanced little over recent decades and screening with clinical assessments is done inconsistently. Alternative strategies using available data, like analysis of diagnostic codes in the clinical record or insurance claims, have very low sensitivity. NLP and ASA used with machine learning are technologies that could greatly increase ability to detect MCI and ADRD in clinical contexts. NLP automatically converts text in the electronic health record (EHR) into structured concepts suitable for analysis. Thus, clinicians’ documentation of signs and symptoms or orders of tests and services that reflect or address cognitive limitations can be efficiently captured, possibly long before the clinician uses an ADRD-related diagnostic code. ASA directly measures cognition by recognizing different features of cognition captured in speech. Extracting features through both NLP and ASA could thus provide a unique measure of cognition and its impact on the individual and their caregivers. Early detection of MCI and ADRD can help researchers identify appropriate patients for research and help clinicians and health systems target patients for preventive care and care coordination. For these reasons, more efficient, highly scalable strategies are needed to identify people with MCI and ADRD. The Specific Aims of this proposal are to (1) Develop and validate a ML algorithm using features extracted from the EHR with NLP to identify patients with CI, (2) Develop and validate a ML algorithm using features extracted from ASA of audio recordings of patient-provider encounters during routine primary care visits to identify patients with CI, (3) Develop and validate a ML algorithm using both NLP and ASA extracted features to create an integrated CI diagnostic algorithm. We will develop machine learning algorithms using NLP and ASA extracted features trained against neurocognitive assessment data on 800 primary care patients in New York City and validate them in an independent sample of 200 patients in Chicago. In secondary analyses we will train ML algorithms to identify MCI and its subtypes. This project will be the most rigorous development of NLP, ASA, and ML algorithms for CI yet performed, the first to test ASA in primary care settings, and the first to test NLP and ASA feature extraction strategies in combination. The multi-disciplinary team of clinicians, health services researchers, and neurocognitive and data scientists will apply machine learning to develop these highly scalable, automated technologies for identification of MCI and ADRD. 1 Project Narrative The ability of clinicians, health systems and researchers to identify patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (ADRD) is limited. This project will apply machine learning to natural language processing (NLP) of electronic health record data and automated speech analysis (ASA) of patient-doctor conversations during primary care visits to identify patients with MCI and ADRD using automated and scalable procedures. The analytic algorithms will be developed with neurocognitive assessment data on 800 primary care patients in New York City and validated in an independent sample of 200 patients in Chicago. 1",Natural Language Processing and Automated Speech Recognition to Identify Older Adults with Cognitive Impairment,10144364,R01AG066471,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Chicago ', ' Cognition ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Health Services ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' New York City ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Reference Standards ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Semantics ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Signs and Symptoms ', ' Diagnostic Findings ', ' Speech ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' falls ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' mental state ', ' mental status ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Psychiatric Diagnosis ', ' cognitive function ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' Study Subject ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Sampling ', ' Documentation ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' electronic data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' demographics ', ' aging population ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' primary care setting ', ' electronic structure ', ' financial incentive ', ' financial reward ', ' monetary incentive ', ' risk mitigation ', ' screening ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' treatment choice ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative care ', ' secondary analysis ', ' recruit ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' testing services ', ' insurance claims ', ' care coordination ', ' coordinating care ', ' deep learning ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' Data Scientist ', ' automated speech recognition ', ' automatic speech recognition ', ' adverse event risk ', ' structured data ', ' unstructured data ', ' feature extraction ', ' learning classifier ', ' clinical encounter ', ' ']",NIA,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,805312,NY-13
"Prediction of therapist cultural competency using Natural Language Processing (NLP) models PROJECT SUMMARY  Racial-ethnic minorities (REM) and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) individuals experience high levels of psychological distress. Psychological treatments can be effective in addressing mental health concerns, but disparities in quality of care still exist. Although systemic and institutional factors contribute to disparities in care, mental health providers are also critical to examine. A primary focus of efforts to understand and reduce provider contributions to mental health care disparities has been to examine cultural competency (CC), which involves a provider’s ability to navigate the cultural aspects of clinical interactions. Patient ratings of CC are generally associated with treatment outcomes and therapeutic processes. While patient perceptions of provider CC are important, a reliance on retrospective patient ratings limits what we know about how cultural identities are discussed, and the language that constitutes culturally sensitive care. Many studies of provider CC also require observers or patients to make complex judgments based on internal provider characteristics that are not reliably observable (e.g. rate provider awareness of their own cultural values). More studies are needed that examine patient-provider interactions in treatment in order to assess the impact of specific provider behaviors, and how they relate to perceptions of provider CC. Recently, Natural Language Processing (NLP) models have been applied to psychotherapy conversations to automatically capture the use of evidence based treatments, topics of conversation, empathy, and emotional expression. Prior research demonstrating the feasibility of automatically identifying topics of conversation in psychotherapy suggest that NLP models could be trained to automatically identify specific moments in sessions where patients and providers are talking about cultural issues. NLP models could allow researchers to not only examine how specific patterns of provider-patient interactions drive CC, but might also provide rapid feedback to providers, and in turn help address disparities in care. The purpose of the current study is to do the foundational work to develop and evaluate NLP tools that capture the cultural content of provider-patient interactions among REM and LGBTQ patients. First, utilizing 32,436 labeled talk turns from 200 psychotherapy sessions we will evaluate the accuracy of NLP models in recognizing the discussion of cultural topics in psychotherapy. Second, we will use NLP models to explore differences in the content of 1,235 psychotherapy sessions that were rated as highly positive or negative on a measure of cultural competence. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although disparities in the quality of mental health treatment for racial-ethnic minority (REM) and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) patients are well known, to date there are no tools that can identify specific patterns of provider-patient interactions that drive disparities in care. This project will evaluate the ability of Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to recognize discussion of cultural topics in psychotherapy among REM and LGBTQ patients, and explore differences in patient-provider interactions with low and high patient ratings of provider cultural competency.",Prediction of therapist cultural competency using Natural Language Processing (NLP) models,10126722,F31MD014941,"['Anxiety ', ' Awareness ', ' Client ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Empathy ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Judgment ', ' Language ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Technology ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' emotional expression ', ' expression of emotion ', ' showing emotion ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' college student ', ' university student ', ' culturally competent ', ' cultural competence ', ' cultural values ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' psychological distress ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' substance abuse treatment ', ' substance abuse therapy ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism ', ' NIAAA ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' ethnoracial ', ' commercial application ', ' community setting ', ' effective intervention ', ' symptomatic improvement ', ' improve symptom ', ' symptom improvement ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' treatment disparity ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' health care disparity ', ' disparate health care ', ' disparate healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' sexual identity ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Queer ', ' LGBTQ ', ' Lesbian Gay Bi-sexual Transgender Queer ', ' provider behavior ', ' clinician behavior ', ' physician behavior ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,F31,2021,46036,UT-02
