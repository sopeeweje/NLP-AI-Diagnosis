"Identification of Novel Agents to Treat PTSD using Clinical Data PROJECT SUMMARY This study will leverage large-scale clinical data from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to identify existing pharmaceutical agents commonly prescribed for a multitude of indications that are incidentally associated with improvements in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Through prior efforts, a data source containing almost 20 years of treatment data on all (over one million) VA users diagnosed with PTSD between October 1999 and February 2018 has been constructed, including a complete historical record of their evidence-based medication and psychotherapy receipt within the VA healthcare system. Importantly, the team has also amassed symptom-level patient-reported PTSD outcome data for hundreds of thousands of these patients. The existing data is a powerful resource with which the research team proposes to explore the following specific aims: (1) identify off-label pharmaceutical agents associated with improvements in PTSD symptoms over time; (2) further evaluate the clinical effectiveness of newly-identified off-label pharmaceutical agents for improvement in PTSD symptoms using rigorous causal methods; and (3) identify common adverse events related to off-label pharmaceutical agents associated with improvements in PTSD symptoms in this complex, psychiatrically and medically ill population The proposed project will identify agents that may merit further rigorous clinical evaluation for psychiatric benefit. New therapeutic targets may be identified that will lead to greater treatment options or specific treatments. Further, identification of off-label medications that improve or have contraindicated effects for psychiatric populations will provide critical guidance to practicing clinicians. PROJECT NARRATIVE Currently, there are few psychopharmacologic treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and available medications do not work sufficiently. In a recent published statement, NIMH noted that “The National Institute of Mental Health would relish the chance to partner with our VA colleagues to exploit [VA data] with the aim of providing guidelines for evidence-based pharmacotherapy for those suffering from PTSD, Veterans and civilians alike.” The proposed study was specifically designed in response to that call; it will use exploratory methods to identify off-label medications that are effective for the treatment of PTSD using a large VA medical records-based dataset.",Identification of Novel Agents to Treat PTSD using Clinical Data,10150094,R01MH121397,"['Accounting ', ' Antidepressive Agents ', ' Antidepressant Agent ', ' Antidepressant Drugs ', ' Antidepressants ', ' anti-depressant agent ', ' anti-depressant drugs ', ' anti-depressants ', ' anti-depressive agents ', ' Biological Psychiatry ', ' Biologic Psychiatry ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Fluoxetine ', ' Fluoxetin ', ' Prozac ', ' Future ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Leadership ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' medication prescription ', ' prescribed medication ', ' Probability ', ' Psychopharmacology ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Psychotropic Drugs ', ' Psychoactive Agents ', ' Psychoactive Compound ', ' Psychoactive Drugs ', ' Psychopharmaceuticals ', ' Publishing ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' post-trauma stress disorder ', ' posttrauma stress disorder ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Time ', ' Trees ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' USFDA ', ' United States Department of Veterans Affairs ', ' United States Veterans Administration ', ' Veterans Administration ', ' Veterans Affairs ', ' Veterans ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Paroxetine ', ' Sertraline ', ' Zoloft ', ' venlafaxine ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Therapeutic Agents ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Remission ', ' Disease remission ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Effectiveness ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Pharmacological Treatment ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' working group ', ' work group ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' evidence based guidelines ', ' Evidence based practice guidelines ', ' evidence based recommendations ', ' psychopharmacologic ', ' psychopharmacological ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' new drug target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new therapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' evidence base ', ' symptomatic improvement ', ' improve symptom ', ' symptom improvement ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' Retrospective cohort ', ' data resource ', ' treatment guidelines ', ' off-label drug ', ' off-label medication ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' military veteran ', ' veteran population ', ' ']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2021,554790,MA-07
"Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration Project Summary Diagnostic imaging costs $100 billion annually. These healthcare costs are expected to increase in the coming decade as the national population ages and the pool of insured patients increases. The size and growth of these costs concern policy makers, payers, and society alike. The use of advanced imaging for PE has increased 27 fold in recent years, and this sharp escalation has the potential to expose patients to unnecessary procedures, tests, and risks due to incidental findings. Although radiologists do not order most radiology exams, these physicians are the target of criticism about the rising costs and possible overuse of radiology services. The healthcare industry has called upon radiologists to manage the potential overuse of advanced imaging and to take the lead on investigating best practices for the optimal use of advanced imaging. The ideal sources of information for imaging utilization guidelines are randomized, controlled imaging clinical trials. However, these trials are cost and time intensive, exceedingly difficult to conduct, and typically use narrow patient-inclusion criteria, making it challenging to generalize the results to broader clinical situations. Alternative sources of reliable evidence, such as observational or retrospective studies, have been lacking. The widespread adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the increasing availability of computational methods to process vast amounts of unstructured information now make it possible to learn directly from practice-based evidence. We propose that “big data” clinical repositories, including radiology reports, can lend themselves to a treasure trove of point-of-care, relevant, actionable data that can be used in an innovative and cost-sensitive approach to evaluate the appropriate use of medical imaging. We aim to create a predictive model that leverages real-time EMR clinical data from top national medical centers to arrive at a patient-specific imaging outcome prediction. We recognize that clinicians have to make on-the-spot medical imaging-ordering decisions and they generally do not comply with existing clinical decision support rules. Our study aims to provide clinicians with a tool that can leverage aggregate patient data for medical imaging decision making at the point of care. The overarching approach of this study is to utilize scalable methodology that can be widely applied to leverage EMR data to predict the outcome of a several other high-cost, low-yield imaging tests. This proposal has the potential to better inform advanced imaging in the learning healthcare system of the future and reduce unnecessary imaging examinations and healthcare costs. Project Narrative Imaging costs make up a significant proportion of health care expenditures and cause concern among policy makers, insurers, and patients alike; the inappropriate use of imaging technology is in part a result of imperfect risk models for imaging clinical decision support tools. Current risk models are often irrelevant to patients and as such, clinicians do not always heed to these recommendations, which in turn leads to unnecessary treatments and increased costs. We propose to create a precision health predictive model that leverages real-time electronic medical record data to arrive at a patient-specific imaging prediction in order to enhance imaging decision making at the point of care and optimize advanced image utilization.",Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional

"Leveraging Data Science and Informatics in an Automated Detection System of Surgical Errors Technological advancements continue to improve surgical outcomes. However, these technologies also introduce new challenges such as communication complexities, equipment troubleshooting under intense pressure, and higher cognitive demand on OR team members. In other words, surgery will continue to be risky despite technological improvements. There is evidence the number of avoidable complications may be underreported, that approximately 39% of in-hospital adverse events are surgical related, and that as many as 4,000 surgical never events (events which should not have occurred) happen in the US each year. The eventual goal of this research is to develop an automated detection system (ADS) of high- risk surgical states. The ADS will prevent surgical safety incidents before they occur through real-time monitoring and notification of appropriate operating room (OR) team members ahead- of-time if there is a looming risk. Thereby allowing the team to reconsider next steps and address the underlying issues, and hence reduce the rates of negative surgical outcomes. This project demonstrates the feasibility and merit of essential components for an ADS. Specifically, the surgical safety literature provides compelling evidence that surgical work-flow disruption (FD) sequences are informative indicators of error causation, therefore it is likely that a future ADS will model and monitor surgical state through tracking flow disruptions. Our current aims are to (1) finish implementation of the Research & Exploratory Analysis Driven Time-data Visualization (READ-TV) research tool; open-source software to visualize FD patterns and other longitudinal data. (2) Develop a stochastic model to predict whether high-risk, disruptive FD sequences will occur based on FD rates at earlier time points. (3) Link FD patterns and sequences with surgical outcomes by developing a text classifier to identify whether or not a surgical safety incident or near-miss occurred based on the associated EHR note. The classifier will be a deep learning model trained with tens of thousands of surgical EHR notes. The text analysis in the third aim will provide insight to FD types and sequences that are more error prone, thereby revealing the FD patterns that an ADS should warn an OR team to avoid. Additional benefits of this text analysis include a possible confirmation of the existence of incident underreporting. Upon completion of the 3 aims, we will have a computational foundation for an ADS: our research tool (aim 1: READ-TV visualization software) and analyses (aim 3: link flow disruptions to safety incidents through EHR note analysis) will advance interpretation of flow disruption (FD) sequences, and our stochastic models (aim 2: predict future surgical state from FD sequences) will prospectively predict error-prone states. This foundation can be extended in future projects through research in automatic transcription of flow disruptions, and the proper mode of alert delivery if the surgery is prone to enter an error-prone state. Surgery by nature is risky for the patient and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future despite technological advancements. The surgical safety literature provides compelling evidence that surgical work-flow disruption (FD) sequences are informative indicators of error causation, and we propose that an automated detection system (ADS) can detect if a surgery has an entered a high-risk state through monitoring of FD sequences, thereby alerting the OR team and preemptively preventing a safety incident. As the first steps for such a system: our research visualization tool (Aim 1) will advance interpretation and clustering of FD sequences, our text-based artificial intelligence models (Aim 3) will link FD patterns and surgery characteristics to safety incidents through computational analysis of over 150,000 surgical notes, and our stochastic models (Aim 2) will verify that a high-risk surgical state can be predicted ahead-of-time by monitoring disruption sequences.",Leveraging Data Science and Informatics in an Automated Detection System of Surgical Errors,10149122,F31LM013402,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Engineering ', ' Equipment ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Hospitals ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Manuals ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Operating Rooms ', ' Patients ', ' pressure ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Surgical Error ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Companions ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Notification ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Informatics ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' discovery mining ', ' literature mining ', ' literature searching ', ' text mining ', ' text searching ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Cognitive ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Text ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Source Code ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' robot assistance ', ' robot assisted ', ' robotic assistance ', ' Visualization software ', ' visualization tool ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' open source ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' operation ', ' data visualization ', ' Data Science ', ' surgery outcome ', ' surgical outcome ', ' data warehouse ', ' real time monitoring ', ' realtime monitoring ', ' deep learning ', ' surgical risk ', ' surgery risk ', ' Visualization ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' detection platform ', ' detection system ', ' ']",NLM,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,F31,2021,43491,SC-01
"Feeding interaction network analyses enhance management of NHP breeding groups Abstract A primary mission of Animal Resources Divisions at National Primate Research Centers (NPRC) is to maintain the overall social health of Indian-origin rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) living in large multi-generational breeding groups in order to ensure the availability of high-quality research subjects for NIH-funded research. The social dynamics of these breeding groups, however, are complex and disturbances in their dominance hierarchy and kinship structures can lead to increased aggression and fighting that may result in significant wounding. Thus, a common challenge in their management is the utilization of effective social heath surveillance methodology to identify groups at risk for social instability before the onset of significant fighting. These captive groups are routinely monitored for changes in dominance ranks and rates of trauma to detect social instability at the family- and group-level; however, the precise timing of severe outbreaks of aggression is largely considered unpredictable. Further, the frequency of interactions that define dominance and affiliative relationships in these groups are sparse; thus, the gathering of enough behavioral data to unequivocally detect social instability is time- consuming. We recently published a report that indicated automated feeding data can provide critical real-time data and assist management with monitoring social stability in rhesus macaque breeding groups, by possibly predicting the timing of intense aggression. The purpose of this proposal is to expand upon these observations by establishing data-driven models that help management identify groups at risk for social instability. Because automated feeding data include precise timestamps and the order in which animals feed, network analyses can be used to construct Feeding Interaction Networks (FINs), allowing us to examine patterns of temporal proximity feeding among kin and non-kin. Because reproductive status also influences food intake in female monkeys, we will study six outdoor breeding groups at the Yerkes NPRC across the breeding and birthing seasons, and integrate social and reproductive data, with the overarching aim to develop comprehensive data-driven FIN models that will enhance colony management practices of NIH-supported rhesus macaque breeding colonies. Aim 1 will characterize the community structures within static FINs of rhesus macaque breeding groups, varying in size and composition. Aim 2 will determine whether the directionality and strength of connections between adult females within a static FIN can be used to predict patterns of affiliative and dominance relationships among kin and non-kin. Aim 3 will quantify and model the temporal changes of community structures within dynamic FINs of rhesus macaque groups across the breeding and birthing season with respect to female reproductive phase. Finally, Aim 4 will detect changes in the community structures of dynamic FINs, not associated with reproductive seasonality, that are precursor to increased aggression and other signs of social instability. These FIN models will be used to supplement behavioral and trauma data, allowing management to identify groups at risk for social instability and develop strategies to intervene prior to the escalation of additional aggression. Narrative The primary goal of this project is to use network analyses to construct a Feeding Interaction Network using automated feeding data collected from animals living in large breeding groups at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center. If successful, these models will identify groups at risk for social instability before the onset of fighting and injury. The application of automated feeding data in the social management of captive colonies of rhesus macaques represents a paradigm shift from more conventional practices.",Feeding interaction network analyses enhance management of NHP breeding groups,10090122,R24OD030035,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Animal Feed ', ' animal food ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Breeding ', ' Communities ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Estradiol ', ' Aquadiol ', ' Dimenformon ', ' Diogyn ', ' Diogynets ', ' Estrace ', ' Estradiol-17 beta ', ' Estradiol-17beta ', ' Estraldine ', ' Ovocyclin ', ' Ovocylin ', ' Progynon ', ' Therapeutic Estradiol ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Lactation ', ' lactating ', ' lactational ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Macaca mulatta ', ' M mulatta ', ' M. mulatta ', ' Rhesus Macaque ', ' Rhesus Monkey ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Monkeys ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Ovulation ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Progesterone ', ' Corpus Luteum Hormone ', ' Delta4-pregnene-3,20-dione ', ' Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione ', ' Pregnenedione ', ' Therapeutic Progesterone ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Social Dominance ', ' Dominance Hierarchy ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Generations ', ' Research Subjects ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Social Network ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Funding ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fighting ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' behavioral observation ', ' behavior observation ', ' cohesion ', ' Practice Management ', ' Structure ', ' member ', ' social unrest ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' reproductive ', ' social bonding ', ' social attachment ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' animal resource ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Intake ', ' Monitor ', ' Behavioral ', ' feeding ', ' affiliative behavior ', ' wound ', ' tissue wound ', ' wounding ', ' wounds ', ' Consumption ', ' Trauma ', ' season of birth ', ' network models ', ' pregnant ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' social relationships ', ' ']",OD,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R24,2021,802738,GA-05

"BIGDATA: Causal Inference in Large-Scale Time Series Project summary Large datasets generated by hospitals could have a transformative effect on medical knowledge and patient care. Yet currently the volume of data is more likely to overwhelm clinicians and the challenges of the data can overwhelm machine learning algorithms. Intensive care units (ICUs) generate data at a resolution of seconds, for the entirety of a patient's stay. Our long-term goal is to turn these data into actionable knowledge, like risk factors for a disease, early intervention targets, and real-time information to support clinical decisions. This is a broad problem, but particularly important in ICUs, which involve high stakes decisions being made in a complex environment under time pressure. We focus in particular on understanding consciousness in adults, and neurologic status in neonates. While 7% of ICU admissions are due to loss of consciousness, and degree of consciousness is critical to evaluating prognosis, making difficult choices such as when to withdraw care, and providing early interventions to improve quality of life, there are no objective or automated assessments for consciousness (adults) or neurologic status (neonates). We have shown that unresponsive patients with brain activation were twice as likely to regain the ability to follow commands compared to unresponsive patients without such activation, yet these assessments are too time consuming for regular clinical use. However we also showed that physiological data routinely collected in ICUs can be used as a proxy to classify consciousness. It is still not known why it changes and we must be sure that the patterns we find are in fact causal to avoid treating symptoms instead of a disease or launching unsuccessful clinical trials. There have been two key barriers preventing a causal understanding of consciousness. First, variables measured for each ICU patient differ, and can differ within a patient over the course of their admission. This leads to confounding when attempting to infer causal models, and has prevented learning a single model for all patients, which limits generalizability. Second, while the challenges of medical data require new methods, researchers are rarely able to rigorously evaluate and compare them, since real-world data lacks ground truth and often cannot be shared for privacy reasons. To address these challenges, we aim 1) to develop methods that learn generalizable causal models with latent variables (by intelligently sharing and combining information across patients), 2) to develop data driven simulations methods for testing machine learning algorithms while preserving privacy, and 3) to apply these methods to neonatal and neurological ICU data. We aim to create better indicators for consciousness and to uncover causes of both neurological status in ICU and its link to long-term functional outcomes. Our work turns potential weaknesses of medical data (different variables measured across individuals) into a strength, and will enable better use of large-scale observational biomedical data for real-time treatment decisions.

"Neural mechanisms for reducing interference during episodic memory formation Project Summary/Abstract One of the biggest challenges to successful remembering is the potential for confusion or interference between similar memories. For every password, name, or parking space that we store in memory, there are many other passwords, names or parking spaces that we have already learned or will learn in the future. While interference is a factor in relatively benign—yet annoying—examples of ‘normal’ forgetting, it is also a major factor in clinically significant examples of forgetting that occur with aging and/or dementia. Thus, there is a fundamental need to understand the neural mechanisms that support the acquisition/retrieval of similar memories while minimizing interference and corresponding forgetting. Computational models of episodic memory have emphasized the critical role of pattern separation in reducing memory interference. Pattern separation involves coding similar memories such that differences between memories are exaggerated and the potential for confusion is thereby minimized. While there is general agreement that pattern separation is implemented by the hippocampus—and that pattern separation is important for reducing memory interference—there remain several fundamental gaps in our understanding of how, when, and why pattern separation occurs. In particular, there remains ambiguity as far as (a) the learning contexts in which each mechanism might be recruited, (b) what the corresponding neural signatures of each mechanism are, and (c) the specific behavioral consequences associated with the engagement of each mechanism. We propose a systematic investigation of the contexts in which integration and pattern separation occur with the goal of using sophisticated, cutting-edge neuroimaging (fMRI) techniques to identify distributed patterns of neural activity that are diagnostic of each mechanism. Critically, we also plan to use these observed patterns of neural activity—that is, neural evidence for integration vs. separation—to predict behavioral memory phenomena, including interference-related forgetting. The research represents a strong synthesis of psychology and neuroscience questions with an emphasis on learning mechanisms inspired by computational models and analysis approaches that draw from the fields of machine learning and data mining. Project Narrative A primary reason we forget is because we store a vast number of memories and interference between these memories becomes inevitable. While forgetting may only represent an occasional annoyance for most people, among older adults and those with dementia—groups that are growing at a disproportionate rate— memory confusion and interference-related forgetting can be debilitating problems. The proposed research seeks to identify neural mechanisms that reduce interference-related forgetting, including in younger and older adults, and will lead to fundamental new insight into how the brain resolves interference between similar memories.",Neural mechanisms for reducing interference during episodic memory formation,10123856,R01NS089729,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Memory ', ' Memory Disorders ', ' Cognitive Retention Disorders ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Names ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Psychology ', ' Research ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Visual Cortex ', ' visual cortical ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' dentate gyrus ', ' Dentate Fascia ', ' Fascia Dentata ', ' Gyrus Dentatus ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Benign ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Funding ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Episodic memory ', ' experience ', ' forgetting ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Property ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Retrieval ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Rodent Model ', ' Behavioral ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' Behavioral Paradigm ', ' motivated behavior ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' neural patterning ', ' high resolution imaging ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' recruit ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2021,485965,OR-04
"GenePattern and GenePattern Notebook: Integrative 'Omic Analysis for Cancer Research Project Summary Over the past two decades, the landscape of cancer research has changed with the explosion of publicly available and investigator generated datasets from evolving technology platforms, and the growing number of sophisticated computational methods and tools to integrate and analyze them. To move the cancer research agenda forward, the cancer research community needs a way to easily combine the right tools and methods to analyze and visualize all the data relevant to their studies, and reproducibly capture the history of what they have done.

"Intention-aware Recommender System for Improving Trauma Resuscitation Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY Critically injured patients have a four-fold higher risk of death from medical errors than other hospitalized patients, with nearly half of preventable deaths related to errors during the initial resuscitation phase. Although protocols, simulation, and leadership training improve team performance in this setting, as many as 12 protocol deviations per resuscitation have been observed, even with experienced teams. Given adverse outcomes that can result from performance gaps, there is a critical need to establish novel approaches for applying real-time decision support in critical-care settings. The long-term goal is to implement decision support for trauma resuscitation and other fast-paced, high-risk critical care settings that improves performance, reduces errors, and prevents adverse outcomes. The overall objective for this renewal is to vertically advance what was achieved during the first funding period by designing, implementing and testing an intention-aware recommender system that (1) recognizes and tracks current goals using sensor data, the output from patient monitors, and data captured from digital devices, (2) derives recommendations that support adherence to goal- based protocols, and (3) displays these recommendations in real time on wall displays. The central hypothesis is that decision support aligning with intentions (“intended” or “current” goals) will enhance protocol compliance, leading to improved outcomes related to trauma resuscitation. The rationale for this renewal is that recommendations supporting protocol compliance that are aligned with team intentions are more likely to be adopted by being less distracting and associated with lower cognitive load. Guided by preliminary data, the central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) design and implement an automated real- time approach for predicting and monitoring the assessment and treatment goals of trauma resuscitation; and 2) generate and display a recommended plan of activities that supports current goal pursuit during trauma resuscitation. For the first Aim, machine learning approaches will be applied for recognizing goals using data obtained from sensors and other digital data sources. Under the second Aim, a machine learning strategy will be implemented and tested that generates recommendations responsive to team intentions. The proposed research is innovative because it focuses on development of real-time methods that integrate goals as an input for making recommendations that meet the most current and relevant information needs. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to improve the care of severely injured and other critically ill patients by promoting timely and appropriate achievement of critical assessment and treatment goals in settings that remain at high-risk for medical errors. The results of this research continuum are expected to have an important positive impact on the outcome by addressing the mismatch between complex decision-making and human vulnerability to error that remain in critical care settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project is relevant to public health because it focuses on the design and implementation of a novel real-time decision support system that will reduce errors associated with adverse patient outcomes by providing recommendations that support the current information needs of multidisciplinary trauma teams. The proposed project is relevant to the part of the NLM's mission related to development of biomedical communications systems, methods, and technologies, and information dissemination and utilization among health professionals.",Intention-aware Recommender System for Improving Trauma Resuscitation Outcomes,10163257,R01LM011834,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Adoption ', ' Awareness ', ' Communication ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Critical Care ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Goals ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Activities ', ' Information Dissemination ', ' dissemination of results ', ' Leadership ', ' Literature ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Multiple Trauma ', ' Multiple Injuries ', ' polytrauma ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Resuscitation ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Caring ', ' Intention ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Failure ', ' Progress Reports ', ' Funding ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Medical Mistakes ', ' Medical Errors ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' Protocol Compliance ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Devices ', ' Decision Support Systems ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Health Professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Output ', ' digital ', ' computerized ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' Trauma ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' high risk ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' cognitive load ', ' cognitive burden ', ' radio frequency ', ' radiofrequency ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' improved outcome ', ' preventable death ', ' preventable mortality ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' severe injury ', ' critical injury ', ' devastating injury ', ' ']",NLM,CHILDREN'S RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,654500,DC-98
"A deep learning platform to evaluate the reliability of scientific claims by citation analysis. The opioid epidemic in the United States has been traced to a 1980 letter reporting in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine that synthetic opioids are not addictive. A belated citation analysis led the journal to append this letter with a warning this letter has been “heavily and uncritically cited” as evidence that addiction is rare with opioid therapy.” This epidemic is but one example of how unreliable and uncritically cited scientific claims can affect public health, as studies from industry report that a substantial part of biomedical reports cannot be independently verified. Yet, there is no publicly available resource or indicator to determine how reliable a scientific claim is without becoming an expert on the subject or retaining one. The total citation count, the commonly used measure, is inherently a poor proxy for research quality because confirming and refuting citations are counted as equal, while the prestige of the journal is not a guarantee that a claim published there is true. The lack of indicators for the veracity of reported claims costs the public, businesses, and governments, billions of dollars per year. We have developed a prototype that automatically classifies statements citing a scientific claim into three classes: those that provide supporting or contradicting evidence, or merely mention the claim. This unique capability enables scite users to analyze the reliability of scientific claims at an unprecedented scale and speed, helping them to make better-informed decisions. The prototype has attracted potential customers among top biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, research institutions, academia, and academic publishers. We propose to conduct research that will refine scite into an MVP by optimizing prototype efficiency and accuracy until they reach feasible milestones, and will refine the product-market fit in our beachhead market, academic publishing, whose influence on the integrity and reliability of research is difficult to overestimate. We propose to develop a platform that can be used to evaluate the reliability of scientific claims. Our deep learning model, combined with a network of experts, automatically classifies citations as supporting, contradicting, or mentioning, allowing users to easily assess the veracity of scientific articles and consequently researchers. By introducing a system that can identify how a research article has been cited, not just how many times, we can assess research better than traditional analytical approaches, thus helping to improve public health by identifying and promoting reliable research and by increasing the return on public and private investment in research.",A deep learning platform to evaluate the reliability of scientific claims by citation analysis.,10162578,R44DA050155,"['Affect ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Epidemic ', ' Government ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Industry ', ' Investments ', ' Literature ', ' Marketing ', ' Medicine ', ' New England ', ' Northeastern United States ', ' Privatization ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Sales ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Measures ', ' Businesses ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Research Activity ', ' Letters ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Visual System ', ' Visual system structure ', ' literature citation ', ' Performance ', ' Proxy ', ' Speed ', ' Program Description ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Institution ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Academia ', ' Data ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Text ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' user-friendly ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' product development ', ' dashboard ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' opiate crisis ', ' opioid crisis ', ' opioid therapy ', ' opiate therapy ', ' deep learning ', ' synthetic opioid ', ' synthetic opiate ', ' learning classifier ', ' ']",NIDA,"SCITE, INC.",R44,2021,753275,NY-12
"Patient specific 3D printed tissue engineered vascular graft for aortic reconstruction designed by artificial intelligence algorithm. 1 The goal of this study is to create patient-specific, hemodynamically optimized, tissue engineered  2 vascular grafts (TEVG) for use in aortic arch repair surgery. These TEVGs are optimized for high pressure  3 circulation using 3D printing technology and artificial intelligence, and will grow with the patient, in hopes of  4 obviating need for future surgeries to replace grafts, which can occur with contemporary arch reconstruction  5 materials. Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death due to congenital anomalies. Despite  6 significant advances in surgical management for CHD, one significant source of morbidity and mortality arises  7 from the complexity of surgery for diverse anatomies in the aortic arch. Previous studies have demonstrated  8 that the resultant arch geometry after surgical reconstruction of stenotic or hypoplastic aortas is important to  9 minimize reduce energy loss and undesirable flow inside the arch, which can lead to hypertension, abnormal 10 vascular response and ventricular dysfunction. Ensuring a patient-specific graft design for ideal reconstructed 11 route before surgery with minimum energy loss and wall shear stress may yield long-term benefits for patient 12 health and quality of life. 13 We have demonstrated native vessel like neotissue formation of TEVG in small and large animal 14 studies. Based on these experiences, we have developed a novel 3D printing technology combining 3D printed 15 metal mandrels with nanofiber electro-spun technology. With this 3D printing technology, we showed that 16 TEVG developed native like neovessel formation in venous circulation in a sheep model. For this next step, we 17 aim to develop grafts in arterial circulation that can be applied to aortic reconstruction. We will also develop 18 automatic design algorithms to design optimal graft shape in order to reduce time and cost of patient specific 19 design. We hypothesize that patient-specific TEVG using our 3D printing technology can be designed, 20 aided by pre-operative imaging and flow data, computer assisted design (CAD), automatic design 21 algorithms based on computation fluid dynamics (CFD) results, and will demonstrate proper neotissue 22 formation and growth while maintaining optimally designed hemodynamics. 23 This project will be an important step towards clinical application of patient-specific vascular grafts that 24 recapitulate the native anatomy and mechanical properties. The results of this work will have a broader impact 25 on the design and fabrication of other more complex cardiovascular structures for implantation. This paradigm 26 shift in vascular graft technology will improve the quality and safety of pediatric patient care. The goal of this study is to create patient-specific, hemodynamically optimized, tissue engineered vascular grafts using 3D printing technology and artificial intelligence for use in aortic arch repair surgery which demands a structured surgical approach in order to optimize hemodynamics postoperatively. We will optimize the design of an aortic graft automatically using computational flow dynamics, refine 3D printing manufacturing, evaluate grafts with in-vitro testing, and finally will test the performance of the grafts in vivo over time.

"Quantifying Compliance to the New 2017 Hypertension Treatment Guidelines and Investigating the Association Between Guideline Compliance and Patients' Trajectory of Blood Pressure Project Summary/Abstract Blood pressure (BP) of ³140/90 mm Hg doubles the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and the total cost of hypertension reaches as high as $51 billion per year. Despite the enormous risk and cost associated with hypertension, less than half (48.3%) of hypertensive patients have a controlled blood pressure (BP) in the United States. Clinical trials demonstrated that a high rate of BP control (up to 85%) can be achieved with currently available therapies and strictly following recommended treatment protocols. This suggests that a higher proportion of uncontrolled BP could be explained by less aggressive treatment, poorer follow-up, and use of fewer or less effective drugs. The 2017 guideline for high BP management was recently published and lowered the threshold for the initiation of medication and definition of uncontrolled BP to BP ≥130/80 mm Hg (from 140/90) for patients with CVD or higher risk of CVD. This challenges physicians to change their traditional hypertension management and could worsen the already low rate of compliance (range 25-65%) to hypertension treatment guidelines. Furthermore, conclusions from previous studies regarding compliance to older hypertension treatment guidelines were compromised due to failure to evaluate multiple aspects of hypertension care, such as comorbidities, follow-up and laboratory assessments; and use of subjective assessment such as physician self-report. The wide-spread adoption of electronic health record (EHR) technology and the vital patient information present in EHR data provide an exceptional opportunity to objectively evaluate several aspects of hypertension care, such as medications prescribed, laboratory procedures ordered, BP level achieved, follow-up monitoring examinations, demographic and comorbid information. We, therefore, propose to use the Northwestern Medicine Enterprise Data Warehouse (NMEDW) – an integrated EHR database of health information from 2.9 million patients to 1) assess compliance to the 2017 hypertension management guidelines for 5 years since its release (2018-2022); 2) investigate whether patient’s age, race, body mass index, history of diabetes, CVD, chronic kidney disease, medication adherence, presence of health insurance and regular physician, and physican speciality predict level of compliance to the new treatment guideline; and 3) examine the association between level of compliance to the 2017 hypertension treatment guidelines and prospective patient BP trajectory over 5 years (2019-2023). Newly diagnosed hypertensive patients’ demographics, BP, medications, lab results, follow-up visit, and comorbid conditions will be assessed from the NMEDW and will be compared to criteria developed based on the 2017 hypertension treatment guidelines to quantify compliance to the guideline. The proposed study provides the candidate an opportunity to learn EHR data-mining skills to assess association between compliance to the new hypertension treatment guideline and patient BP trajectory and to identify predictors of this compliance, as a first step, in designing future targeted interventions to enhance guideline compliance and BP control. Project Narrative The 2017 hypertension treatment guideline lowered the threshold for the initiation of hypertensive medication and definition of uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) to BP ≥130/80 mm Hg (from ≥140/90).

"A Comprehensive Strategy to Detect Glaucoma Worsening Earlier and With Fewer Tests ABSTRACT  This is an application for a K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award. The goal of this proposal is to provide the candidate with the advanced skills needed to establish an independent research program in the area of glaucoma diagnostic testing with special expertise in test error correction and predictive modeling of future glaucoma outcomes. To facilitate this long-term goal, in the current proposal, the candidate’s main research goal is to reduce the time and number of tests necessary to detect glaucoma worsening by (1) correcting for errors in previously obtained visual field (VF) and peripapillary optical coherence tomography (OCT) tests by using multilevel models with Bayesian analysis (MLB) and generative adversarial networks (GAN) (2) stratifying eyes at high and low risk for rapid glaucoma worsening at the baseline clinical visit using deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN). These aims are based on high quality preliminary data which show that: (1) the effect of VF reliability metrics and OCT signal strength on test error can be quantified and thus corrected for and (2) machine learning methods can predict risk of future VF progression with fair accuracy with baseline visit VF data alone and therefore adding structural (OCT) and clinical information from the baseline visit is likely to improve model accuracy. The main hypotheses of the proposed research aims are (1) correcting for test errors with MLB and GAN will reduce the time needed to detect worsening by 10 and 20% respectively (2) combining baseline visit structural (OCT), functional (VF) and clinical data as inputs into DCNNs will allow us to achieve an area under the receiver operating curve of at least 0.8 at predicting the risk of future rapid glaucoma worsening. The candidate proposes a comprehensive training plan, combining formal coursework, meetings, seminars and workshops overseen by his diverse group of mentors. Specific training goals include: (1) Receiving training in multi-level regression modeling and Bayesian analysis techniques. (2) Becoming adept at data science with a special emphasis on learning Python for data extraction, manipulation and analysis. (3) Furthering knowledge of machine learning techniques with a specific emphasis on deep learning including DCNNs and GANs. (4) Continuing training in the ethical and responsible conduct of research. The training plan will be executed in coordination with the set of research activities mentioned above. Results from this research proposal will be used to develop a subsequent R01 research proposal that will facilitate the candidate’s transition to an independent researcher. PROJECT NARRATIVE The main aim of this study is to reduce the time and number of tests needed to accurately detect worsening of glaucoma by 1) correcting visual field and optical coherence tomography tests for errors and 2) accurately predicting future disease worsening based on baseline visit clinical, functional and structural data.

"Leveraging Electronic Health Records and Genomic Biobanks for Kidney Stone Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Kidney stones are highly prevalent and recurrent. Our current understanding of kidney stone disease risk factors and disease associations has relied primarily on data from chart review, nonspecific administrative datasets, and secondary analyses of observation studies. Current study designs suffer from small sample sizes, heterogenous patient groups, and lack of standardized accuracy data and outcome definitions. The widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) provides novel research opportunities for kidney stone disease. EHRs contain a robust clinical repository of data collected over time from clinical care. However, there are currently limited tools to identify and characterize kidney stone patients in the EHR. The objective of this study is to establish feasibility of utilizing EHR data to investigate kidney stone disease. To structure EHR data in an efficient and cost-effective manner, natural language processing and deep learning methods can be designed for identifying and phenotyping kidney stone patients and clinical outcomes. Our de-identified EHR is linked to a DNA biobank that can enable investigation of genetic associations with disease. This project has two specific aims. In Aim 1, we will perform genetic association studies in our EHR and linked DNA biobank. We will replicate previously described associations with genetic variants and kidney stone disease. We will then perform a genome-wide association study to discover novel associations. In Aim 2, our goal is to develop and validate a computable framework to extract clinical outcomes of kidney stone disease from the EHR. Clinically meaningful outcomes include symptomatic stone passage and radiographic stone characterization. We will develop and test natural language processing and deep learning algorithms to extract keywords and context-based information in clinical notes and reports. We will train and test these algorithms using manual annotation as the gold standard. This aim will enable rigorous phenotyping of each kidney stone patient using structured and unstructured EHR data. Successful completion of this project will lay the groundwork towards advancing genomic medicine and precision health to support clinical decision-making in kidney stone patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our overall goal is to establish the feasibility of kidney stone research using electronic health record data. Genetic association studies will be performed to replicate known and discover new variants with kidney stone disease.

"LIVOPT -- LIVer cirrhosis - Optimizing Prediction of Patient OuTcomes PROJECT ABSTRACT Cirrhosis is a leading cause of mortality in the United States (US), diagnosed in millions of people and resulting in over 40,000 deaths each year, predominately in older people. These patients are at higher risk of serious complications (e.g. infection, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy), hospitalization and death. Little is known about the epidemiology and disease progression and older patients are more vulnerable and might have different risk profiles. The clinical challenge is to accurately and early predict who is at highest risk for requiring hospitalization and/or death and understanding how this might be different in older versus younger adults. . One barrier to date has been the lack of an epidemiologically representative patient sample that captures those with cirrhosis and goes beyond one health system, as many data repositories are skewed or limited: CMS only captures elderly and those with debility, NIS does not allow longitudinal observation, UNOS represents less than one percent of those with cirrhosis. Hence, we will build on our previous work to use a unique dataset, the Chicago Area Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network (CAPriCORN). CAPriCORN captures the electronic health records (EHR) from nine health systems from 2011-present (incl. academic center, county, VA and private), catching most of the diverse patient population in the greater Chicago metropolitan area, namely ~160,000 patients with liver cirrhosis. The dataset is extensive, allowing the use of traditional (e.g., regression) and novel analytical techniques (e.g. deep learning) to pursue the aims of the study. We aim to model cirrhosis progression in the elderly and to predict the risk of hospitalization and death in older patients with cirrhosis. We also aim to perform sub-group analyses focusing on race and socioeconomic factors in the elderly. The impact of accurate and early prediction of mortality and hospitalization risk in elderly patients with cirrhosis allows for targeted interventions of the most vulnerable patients to improve outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because liver cirrhosis affects a large segment of the elderly population with high mortality and high risk for decompensation requiring resource-intensive care, yet little knowledge exists about disease progression and risk prediction. We use a large population based dataset, Chicago Area Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network (CAPriCORN), which captures the electronic health records (EHR) from nine health systems from 2011-present (incl. academic center, county, VA and private), catching most of the diverse patient population in a large metropolitan area, namely ~160,000 patients with liver cirrhosis.

"Generalizable prediction of medication adherence in heart failure Project Summary/Abstract Heart failure (HF) is associated with high rates of hospitalization and mortality. While a number of evidence- based therapies have been shown to improve outcomes for patients with HF, nearly half of these patients are not regularly taking their medications. Although medication adherence can be improved through timely interventions, it is challenging for clinicians to accurately identify and predict medication non-adherence at the point of care. The challenge persists partly because medication adherence is a complex process influenced by an interplay of a multitude of patient-, provider-, system-, community-, and therapy-related factors. This gap in identifying patients at risk of non-adherence can be addressed through increasing availability of relevant data from electronic health records (EHRs), which affords the potential to make accurate, real time predictions of adherence in HF. In particular, recent linkages of EHR and pharmacy data has created opportunity for incorporation of prior medication fills into EHR-based adherence prediction models that are updated continuously. Using machine learning (ML) techniques with such data allows for incorporation of a large number of intercorrelated risk factors and their interactions into models and for accommodating continuous updates as new information becomes available. Our objective is to build a ML-based algorithm to predict adherence among patients with HF. The specific aims are: 1) to develop supervised ML algorithms to predict medication adherence among HF patients, using EHR clinical data, linked pharmacy fill data, and location- based social determinants data from a large, urban health system that cares for a diverse patient population; 2) to assess fairness of the developed algorithms by evaluating cross-validated prediction and calibration on patient subgroups based on social and economic factors, to ensure that the desirable prediction performance is maintained for the diverse groups; and 3) to assess generalizability of the algorithms through validation in a second large, urban health system caring for a diverse population. Our approach is innovative and novel in several ways. First, we will take advantage of linkages between pharmacy fill information and the EHR to incorporate pharmacy data in our models. Second, we utilize geocoding of patient addresses combined with publicly available data to incorporate neighborhood-level social determinants of health, which are among the most important predictors of adherence, into our models. Third, we will assess fairness of the model by evaluating the predictive performance and calibration on patients from diverse backgrounds. Fourth, we will ensure generalizability of the prediction algorithm by developing it in one diverse health system and validating the algorithm in a second diverse health system. These models will be developed such that they can be used for point-of-care adherence prediction. Our long term goal is to be able to implement them into the EHR, at which point they can be incorporated into interventions to address medication adherence and, ultimately, improve both adherence and clinical outcomes for patients with HF. Project Narrative Poor medication adherence in heart failure can lead to poor health, but many clinicians are unable to determine who would benefit from interventions to address adherence. We will build machine learning models to identify patients at risk of not taking their medicines using an approach that minimizes potential biases. Electronic health record data will be used in these models, allowing them to be incorporated into interventions to improve medication adherence and reduce the disease burden of heart failure.",Generalizable prediction of medication adherence in heart failure,10095553,R01HL155149,"['Algorithms ', ' Calibration ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Medicine ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Time ', ' Urban Health ', ' Work ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' Performance ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' point of care ', ' electronic data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' medication compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' population based ', ' social health determinants ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' health data ', ' improved outcome ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' hospitalization rates ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' medication nonadherence ', ' medication non-adherence ', ' social factors ', ' social determinants ', ' sociodeterminant ', ' algorithm development ', ' ']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,763554,NY-12
"PheMAP: Measured, Automated Profile to Facilitate High Throughput Phenotyping Electronic health records (EHRs) are a powerful and efficient tool for biological discovery globally. However, a vital step for EHR-based research is valid, accurate, and reliable phenotyping (i.e., correctly identifying individuals with a particular trait of interest). Conventional approaches to phenotyping are ad hoc, domain expert dependent, rule-based, and usually specific to EHR environments. However, each requires an extensive investment of time and resources to develop due to the heterogeneity, complexity, inaccuracy, and frequent fragmentation of EHRs. The lack of general, automatic, and portable approaches to enable accurate high- throughput phenotyping is a critical barrier that hampers our ability to leverage valuable clinical data in EHRs for better healthcare. We propose a new generalizable high-throughput approach: Phenotyping by Measured, Automated Profile (PheMAP) that we have developed from public resources and will further refine and implement across various EHRs. We recognize that mass information about phenotypes is often described in significant detail and continuedly accumulated within publicly available resources (e.g., MedlinePlus and Wikipedia). We hypothesize this information can be retrieved, filtered, organized, measured, and formalized into standard EHR phenotype profiles. Indeed, we have used such an ensemble approach to integrate four generalizable online medication resources (e.g., SIDER and RxNorm) to create MEDI--a resource linking 2,136 medications and 13,304 indications. In preliminary studies, we extended this strategy to phenotyping and created a prototype PheMAP. For each phenotype, we identified relevant clinical concepts and weighted each based on its importance to the phenotype. We then mapped all associated concepts to commonly-used clinical terminologies. Our preliminary studies showed an average consistency of 98.6%±0.8% between our early-stage PheMAP and three validated eMERGE algorithms (Type 2 Diabetes, dementia, and hypothyroidism). We seek support to refine and optimize PheMAP and develop tools to allow researchers to implement PheMAP efficiently in different EHRs. This will allow researchers to rapidly and accurately determine the status of thousands of phenotypes for millions of individuals with minimal human intervention. Since PheMAP is created using independent resources that are more generalizable than a local clinical dataset, the implementation will generate more consistent outcomes in different EHRs for large-scale analyses.The work we propose is a necessary step toward being able to conduct high-throughput genome-wide and phenome-wide association analyses (GWASs and PheWASs). We will use data from multiple biobanks to accomplish these tasks. Specifically, we will achieve the following goals in this grant: 1.refine PheMAP and conduct large-scale validation, 2. implement PheMAP and perform representative GWASs and PheWASs, 3. Use PheMAP to conduct GWASs for unstudied or understudied diseases and phenotypes, and 4. Share PheMAP to facilitate research using EHRs.

"Primed to (re)act: Can changes in procedural language prevent adverse events between police and minority male youth? PROJECT SUMMARY While researchers continue to study the effects of disproportionate minority contact with law enforcement on a range of health-related outcomes, a recent review of this work questions the methodological validity of most studies on this topic. Many of these concerns focus on (a) unrealistic assumptions about police behavior and (b) poor quality data. This project addresses both by introducing a human development based model of law enforcement officer (LEO) behavior and applying this model to study how LEOs identify with male minority youth (MMY) using a novel publicly available data source: broadcast police communications (BPC). Our long-term goals are (1) to assess the viability of BPC for understanding how LEOs perceive MMY both “in the moment” via the pre-reflective procedural language used before and during LEO-MMY encounters and “at rest” via development of a survey instrument measuring LEO identification with minority youth, and (2) to determine if BPC may be used in lieu of non-public data sources to study police behavior by developing a novel computational strategy for extracting meaningful information from BPC via, among other strategies, a first-of-its-kind automatic speech recognition (ASR) model and large scale (>100 hours) training corpus of transcribed BPC for use by computational social scientists and ASR researchers. Our previous research revealed that a complex set of psychosocial mechanisms govern the developmental trajectories of MMYs, indicating MMYs adopt reactive coping strategies to particular stressful events (e.g. encounters with police) that can be maladaptive (e.g. hypermasculinity) depending on context of interactions. Our work also suggests that all humans are subject to similar processes. Since the outcomes of LEO-MMY encounters are ultimately the responsibility of LEOs, this project seeks to improve the quality of these encounters (i.e. reduce youth trauma) by studying a little acknowledged LEO reactive coping strategy: the character of procedural language used to provide LEOs with incident-specific information via BPC. This conceptual approach derives from our theoretical framing (i.e. Spencer’s phenomenological variant of ecological systems theory, or PVEST) that highlights the development and utilization of reactive coping strategies in response—particularly—to MMY associated stress. It is our premise that BPC can prime LEOs to inaccurately interpret the behavior of MMY as threatening, increasing the potential for adverse events. Such inaccurate assessments are hard to combat since LEOs are acting on the best information available. As a result, the procedural language of BPC pose unacknowledged risks to the well- being of MMY. This study will thus perform a first-of-its-kind analysis of BPC to simultaneously assess its viability for determining racial discrimination in policing and develop a novel survey instrument measuring LEOs ability to identify with MMY for use by researchers and policing organizations across the country. Public Health Relevance / Project Narrative Across the United States, adverse events involving law enforcement officers (LEOs) and male minority youth (MMY) and the toxic stress associated with repeated negative LEO-MMY encounters raise compelling public health concerns about racial discrimination in policing. The proposed research addresses these concerns by (a) introducing a novel human development paradigm for the study of police behavior that focuses on how and to what extent LEOs identify with MMY and (b) assessing the technological viability of using broadcast police communications (BPC) for large scale analysis of police behavior, where BPC are analyzed as pre-reflective accounts of LEO thought processes, representing both reactive and stable coping mechanisms (i.e., speech acts) for ensuring the safety of LEOs and the public at large. Accordingly, we propose (1) using this novel data source to understand how LEOs and MMYs come to perceive each other, (2) test a similarly novel survey instrument for measuring LEO identification with minority youth, in the process determining how much meaningful information can be reliably extracted from audio recordings of BPC for identifying racial discrimination in policing without the need to access highly sensitive police records or video recording data.",Primed to (re)act: Can changes in procedural language prevent adverse events between police and minority male youth?,10121621,R01MD015064,"['Archives ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Chicago ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Data Sources ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Development ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' male ', ' Methodology ', ' Motivation ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Perception ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Speech ', ' Stress ', ' Stressful Event ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Systems Theory ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' United States ', ' Video Recording ', ' Videorecording ', ' video recording system ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Police ', ' Law Enforcement Officers ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Law Enforcement ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Training ', ' racial discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' race-based discrimination ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Research Activity ', ' data quality ', ' Exposure to ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Hour ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Country ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' ESTs ', ' Expressed Sequence Tags ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' acronyms ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Trauma ', ' Affective ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' combat ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' coping mechanism ', ' racial disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' course development ', ' class development ', ' course material development ', ' automated speech recognition ', ' automatic speech recognition ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2021,744667,IL-01
"Using Machine Learning to Detect and Characterize Synthetic Psychoactive Drug Digital Marketing and Distribution The study will address a critical challenge regarding the public health threat of synthetic psychoactive drugs (SPDs): identifying and characterizing how social media is used to market, distribute and sell these products to the public. We will carry out these aims by examining large volumes of data from popular social media platforms Twitter and Instagram using an innovative methodology involving machine learning and multidisciplinary data analysis. This research project addresses a key NIDA research objective: “research on factors which influence initiation, continuation and desistance of use of specific SPDs in different populations. Examples include:…market and distribution factors; policies; and the role of peer influences, social media and the internet.” We will first collect large volumes of data filtered for SPD drug diversion, marketing, and drug dealing via social media posts, comments, and other messages. We will then code the data using an advanced machine learning protocol. Finally, we will analyze the data using statistical, geospatial and network analysis to assess associations between SPD marketing and specific risk factors for user groups. We will accomplish these objectives using a multidisciplinary approach that involves disciplines and methods from public health-epidemiology, substance abuse research, computation science, legal and policy analysis, and geospatial analysis. The project has the following specific aims:  Aim 1: Conduct digital surveillance of popular social media platforms Twitter and Instagram in order to  describe the nature and magnitude of online marketing, sale and distribution of SPDs;  Aim 2: Characterize the types of marketing strategies used by SPD vendors and drug dealers on these  platforms, including marketing messages used to influence knowledge, attitudes and perceptions  pertaining to SPDs and identification of the users and networks they target;  Aim 3: Using statistical, network and geospatial methods, describe, test, and visualize associations  between SPD marketing and distribution and specific risk factors and user groups. This is a critical opportunity to better understand how social media contributes to a growing “digital” risk environment that can influence user initiation and enable illegal access to SPDs. Though research examining the linkages between social media and substance abuse has been growing, no study has specifically examined online marketing and access characteristics on more than one platform while at the same time assessing how geographic and user network factors can impact this unique and largely unregulated risk environment. Results from this study can generate further study hypotheses on the association between SPD behavioral risk factors and SPD product trends, while also informing future interventions utilizing e-health tools including targeted regulation, health education, and counter-marketing. The emergence of the public health threat of synthetic cannabinoids and other new synthetic psychoactive substances (SPDs) is coinciding with an increase in the use of the Internet and social media to promote substance abuse behavior and illicit access. In response, the proposed project will leverage advanced methods in “big data” analysis to identify and characterize marketing and distribution of SPDs by conducting surveillance of SPD content and messages on Twitter and Instagram.

"DEVELOPMENT OF BASELINE GENE EXPRESSION-BASED RESPONSE PREDICTOR FOR ANTI-TNFA THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASES ABSTRACT Anti-TNFα therapies are widely used to treat autoimmune diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a chronic inflammation of the digestive system which presents both an economic burden as well as prominent disability and morbidity. These therapies, however, are largely ineffective in IBD patients, with primary non- response rates varying from 10-30%, and with 23-46% of patients losing response over time. They also lead to adverse health outcomes including increased risk of infections (most notably reactivation of tuberculosis), liver problems, arthritis, and lymphoma. Due to biologic switching where multiple drugs are tried in sequence until an effect is observed, they often lead to overall increased healthcare costs. There is no clear predictive factor of response or loss of response to anti-TNFα therapies, with current research focusing on efficacious dosage and inhibitor selection. While numerous predictors of response have been identified in studies, none are robust enough to impact clinical practice. Overcoming this gap in the administration of anti-TNFα therapies will be an important next step in improving their utility and reducing overall healthcare costs, morbidity, and mortality. This project proposes a multicohort meta-analysis and machine learning approach to discover and validate a prognostic gene signature that can differentiate anti-TNFα responders from non-responders in IBD patients, allowing for improved decision-making and positive health outcomes. Despite the broad biological, clinical, and technical heterogeneity inherent in such a task, the Inflammatix analytical framework was able to identify significant differentially expressed genes that discriminate anti-TNFα responders from non-responders (mean discovery AUC of ~0.83 and mean validation AUC of ~0.81). Supported by these preliminary results, this project will (1) discover a robust, clinically translatable multi-gene prognostic signature using publicly available datasets, (2) generate independent gene expression data from retrospective cohorts of mucosal biopsy samples (n=150) to validate the signature (target AUC > ~0.8), and (3) use our proprietary Inflammatix machine learning (IML) platform to train and validate a plethora of machine learning algorithms to develop a robust, generalizable classifier (target AUC ~ 0.8 - 0.9) that is ready for clinical validation via prospective studies. Our novel prognostic signature will transform the clinical paradigm in the use and administration of anti-TNFα therapies, maximizing treatment benefit while minimizing patient exposure to potentially harmful side effects and adverse health outcomes, consequently reducing financial burden for the healthcare system and patient. NARRATIVE Anti-TNFα therapies are widely used to treat autoimmune diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), however, they are ineffective in greater than half of patients, and carry significant risks with associated healthcare costs. This project will discover and validate a prognostic, generalizable mRNA signature that can identify IBD patients who are likely to respond to anti-TNFα treatment, transforming how physicians use and administer these expensive and oftentimes risk-laden therapies to maximize patient benefit and minimize adverse health outcomes. Improved treatment decision-making will undoubtedly help address ever-increasing cases of IBD in the US and globally while reducing overall healthcare costs, morbidity, and mortality.",DEVELOPMENT OF BASELINE GENE EXPRESSION-BASED RESPONSE PREDICTOR FOR ANTI-TNFA THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASES,10138841,R43DK127578,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Arthritis ', ' arthritic ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune condition ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Biology ', ' Biopsy ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Decision Making ', ' gastrointestinal system ', ' Ailmentary System ', ' Alimentary System ', ' Digestive System ', ' Gastrointestinal Body System ', ' Gastrointestinal Organ System ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Genes ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Disorder ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Lymphoma ', ' Germinoblastic Sarcoma ', ' Germinoblastoma ', ' Malignant Lymphoma ', ' Reticulolymphosarcoma ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"The Ohio Valley Node of the Clinical Trials Network Project Summary (Abstract): Since its establishment in 2000, the Ohio Valley Node (OVN) has been one of the most productive of NIDA's Clinical Trials Network (CTN) nodes, both in leading and participating in multi-site trials. The OVN includes successful partnerships with four healthcare systems, two pharmacy networks, and six addiction specialty/ infectious disease programs. These collaborating sites span a seven-state region including some of the states most heavily impacted by opioid (Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia) and methamphetamine (Missouri, Kentucky, and North Dakota) use. The OVN includes Midwestern, Appalachian, Upper South, and Native American representation, which significantly enhances the geographical and cultural diversity of the CTN. The OVN Research Core is the driving force of the OVN and is led by Dr. Winhusen, one of the foremost experts in conducting multi-site addiction clinical trials in clinical practice settings. The OVN investigators have extensive expertise in substance use disorders (Winhusen, Brown, Burlew, Lyons, Montgomery, Lofwall, Walsh) and bioinformatics (Kaelber, Xu). The six members of the OVN research-implementation team bring > 60 years of combined experience conducting CTN clinical trials. If funded, our overall goal would be to utilize the wealth of experience and expertise gained over the past 19 years to conduct the research needed to address public health care crises, including the opioid use epidemic and the alarming increase in stimulant use. To this end, we would work with our healthcare partners to engage a diverse set of patients and service systems in areas highly impacted by substance use in CTN research. We would also contribute our expertise in conducting efficacy, effectiveness, and implementation trials testing the full range of interventions, from medications to behavioral interventions and health service innovations, for both opioid and stimulant use disorders. Moreover, we would contribute our expertise in the use of electronic health records for prospective and retrospective research studies, including the application of artificial intelligence to large healthcare datasets. In sum, we seek to continue providing scientific leadership, particularly on studies that could meaningfully impact clinical practice, and to effectively collaborate with a variety of professionals including treatment providers, investigators from diverse institutions, and staff of the Center for CTN (CCTN), clinical coordinating center (CCC) and data and statistics center (DSC) in support of the CTN mission.

"Development of a vaccine informatics system and its application to identifying the impact of vaccine debate on immunization rates during a global pandemic Vaccine debate has been on social media for more than a decade, and a surge of anti-vaccine activities on social media has been detected during prior disease outbreaks. Nonetheless, how this debate changes and impacts the uptake rates for crucial vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic remains unknown. The long-term goal is to counteract the negative impact of misinformation on digital platforms that threatens public health. The overall objectives of this application are to develop a publicly accessible vaccine informatics system to track vaccine debate, and to test the impact of vaccine debate on COVID-19 (if developed by 2021), flu, and HPV immunization rates during the onset of a global pandemic. The central hypothesis is that vaccine debate will increase and become more negative during the pandemic, leading to lower vaccine uptake rates. The rationale for this project is that discovering how vaccine debate changes and influences vaccine uptake rates during a pandemic will be critically important for managing and preventing disease spread. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Develop a vaccine informatics system to identify the frequency and valence of vaccine debate during and following the pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic baseline; and 2) Apply this system to identify the causal impact of vaccine debate on immunization rates during the pandemic. Under the first aim, ~1 million social media posts will be collected, and a deep-learning algorithm for classifying multimodal social media posts will be developed. This algorithm will address potential bias and noise in human annotations of vaccine debate that is increasingly politicized. The classification results will be tabulated in a Web portal so that daily and weekly statistics about pro- and anti-vaccine posts will be readily available. Under the second aim, a multimethod approach will be proposed that resolves the current barriers in research on vaccine refusal. This approach will use a survey of 2,000 individuals who represent the US population. The survey responses will be combined with the respondents' prior engagement with vaccine debate retrospectively collected from social media. These engagement data will be then classified by the machine- learning algorithm developed in Aim 1. This research is innovative because it proposes a robust co-teaching framework for addressing noisy human annotations of vaccine debate. It also proposes a statistical modeling technique that involves heterogenous metrics obtained from a multi-method approach for hypothesis testing. These innovations are timely and urgent as the current time presents a rare opportunity to identify the impact of vaccine debate on public health during the onset of a global pandemic. The feasibility of this proposed research is clear from the solid preliminary datasets collected from 2018-2020 that establish the pre-pandemic baseline. The proposed research is significant because it will produce a public barometer of vaccine debate and provide a methodological breakthrough in uncovering the reasoning behind refusing crucial vaccines during the global pandemic. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the novel vaccine informatics system will gather information about vaccine debate on social media, and apply it to identify the negative impact of social media anti-vaccine content on immunization rates for COVID-19, flu and HPV during the onset of a global pandemic. The expected outcomes will vertically advance knowledge about effective data management and vaccine-refusal increases during public health crises. This will enable public health officials to focus their intervention efforts on those who are at risk of delaying or refusing crucial vaccines during a pandemic, thereby reducing healthcare costs for managing epidemics and decreasing morbidity.",Development of a vaccine informatics system and its application to identifying the impact of vaccine debate on immunization rates during a global

"Imaging biomarkers of severe respiratory infections in premature infants Phase II ABSTRACT  Prematurity is the largest single cause of death in children under five in the world and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) are the top cause of hospitalization and mortality in premature infants. Clinical tools to predict the risk and assess the severity of LRTI in premature babies are critically needed to allow early interventions to decrease the high morbidity and mortality in this patient group. Our goal is to improve clinical practice by developing an objective framework to predict the risk and assess the severity of respiratory disease in premature babies using non-invasive low-radiation X-ray imaging biomarkers and clinical parameters.  In the Phase I of this project, our multidisciplinary team of pulmonologists, neonatologists and imaging and machine learning specialists developed an imaging software technology called Lung Aeration and Irregular opacities Radiological analyzer (LungAIR). Our accomplishments include: 1) establishing a curated ground truth of focal findings in chest X-Ray (CXR) of premature babies; 2) developing a machine learning algorithm to automatically localize and quantify CXR-based prematurity lung disease signatures (fibrosis/interstitial opacities, cystic changes and hyperinflation); 3) creating a graphical user interface for clinical deployment; and 4) evaluating our imaging software technology in an independent cohort. We also demonstrated that the imaging biomarkers obtained by LungAIR correlate strongly with the severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)—the most common respiratory complication of prematurity-- and the cumulative exposure to supplemental O2 and mechanical ventilation in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) (p<0.001). Importantly, our preliminary results indicated that the combination of imaging and clinical markers (BPD severity) provide an accurate predictive model for LRTI-related complications in the first year of life (AUC=74, p<0.01).  This Phase II project builds on the findings and methodology developed in Phase I. In Specific Aim 1, we will incorporate a model of lung disease risk factors in LungAIR platform. Our software will ingest respiratory support information daily during NICU hospitalization and integrate the data with CXR analysis. In Specific Aim 2, we will extend LungAIR to perform longitudinal analyses during hospitalization with the potential to accelerate the prediction of health risks. We will also integrate our results with the electronic health record of the patient for improve the clinical workflow. In Specific Aim 3 we will conduct a clinical study to prospectively evaluate the LungAIR clinical platform functionality. The proposal includes the business model and a path to commercializing LungAIR. The early identification of premature babies at high risk for BPD and severe LRTI should improve their outcome, reduce hospitalization times and inherent clinical costs, and decrease infant mortality. In addition, the ability to objectively quantify and track lung imaging biomarkers will also guide therapy and clinical trials, as well as improve the longitudinal monitoring of infants.

"Efficient Statistical Learning Methods for Personalized Medicine Using Large Scale Biomedical Data Project Summary/Abstract  Current medical treatment guidelines largely rely on data from randomized controlled trials that study  average effects, which may be inadequate for making individualized decisions for real-world patients. Large-scale electronic health records (EHRs) data provide unprecedented opportunities to optimize personalized treatment strategies and generate evidence relevant to real-world patients. However, there are inherent challenges in the use of EHRs, including non-experimental nature of data collection processes, heterogeneous data types with complex dependencies, irregular measurement patterns, multiple dynamic treatment sequences, and the need to balance risk and benefit of treatments. Using two high-quality EHR databases, Columbia University Medical Center's clinical data warehouse and the Indiana Network for Patient Care database, and focusing on type 2 diabetes (T2D), this proposal will develop novel and scalable statistical learning approaches that overcome these challenges to discover optimal personalized treatment strategies for T2D from real-world patients. Specifically, under Aim 1, we will develop a unified framework to learn latent temporal processes for feature extraction and dynamic patient records representation. Our approach will accommodate large-scale variables of mixed types (continuous, binary, counts) measured at irregular intervals. They extract lower-dimensional components to reflect patients' dynamic health status, account for informative healthcare documentation processes, and characterize similarities between patients. Under Aim 2, we will develop fast and efficient multi-category machine learning methods, in order to evaluate treatment propensities and adaptively learn optimal dynamic treatment regimens (DTRs) among the extensive number of treatment options observed in the EHRs. The methods will provide  sequential decisions that determine the best treatment sequence for a T2D patient given his/her EHRs. Under Aim 3, we will develop statistical learning methods to assist multi-faceted treatment decision-making, which balances risks versus benefits when evaluating a DTR. Our approach will ensure maximizing benefit to the greatest extent while controlling all risk outcomes under the safety margins. For all aims, we will develop efficient stochastic resampling algorithms to scale up the optimization for massive data sizes. We will identify optimal DTRs for T2D using the extracted information from patients' comorbidity conditions, medications, and laboratory tests, as well as records-collection processes. Our methodologies will be applied and cross-validated between the two EHR databases. The treatment strategies learned from the representative EHR databases with a diverse patient  population will be beneficial for individual patient care, assisting clinicians to adaptively choose the optimal treatment for a patient. Finally, we will disseminate our methods and results through freely available software and outreach to the informatics and clinical experts at our Centers for Translational Science and elsewhere. Project Narrative  This proposal aims to develop novel and scalable statistical learning methods to analyze electronic health records (EHRs) and use two real-world, high-quality EHR databases for personalized medicine research. The methods will handle the non-experimental nature of data collection processes, along with heterogeneous data types, dynamic treatment sequences, and the trade-off between benefit and risk outcomes.

"Coupling Results Data from ClinicalTrials.gov and Bibliographic Databases to Accelerate Evidence Synthesis Project Summary Clinical trials are foundational to evidence-based medicine, but results reporting from trials is incomplete and frequently delayed. It is estimated that as many as half of clinical trials are not published and as many as half of published trials underreport or misreport outcomes. This type of results reporting distorts the evidence available to clinicians—particularly when it comes to assessing the safety of interventions like drugs and devices—and may place patients at unnecessary risk. There is a critical need for novel methods to identify and monitor drug safety data. Through the infrastructure provided by ClinicalTrials.gov, structured trial results (including safety findings) are now becoming available for an increasing number of trials in a comprehensive and timely fashion. However, access and use of these data in evidence synthesis tasks remain limited. ClinicalTrials.gov is the largest single registry for clinical studies worldwide and includes more than 260,000 registered studies. Of the 108,941 completed trials registered with the site, 20% have uploaded results data for a total of 7.85 million participants. Results data reported on ClinicalTrials.gov have the potential to fill gaps created by delays and biases in published articles and provide an earlier and more complete overview of available trial evidence. We propose to develop novel informatics approaches based on combinations of information retrieval and machine learning methods to facilitate access and analysis of trial results reported in this registry. Focusing on trials testing drug interventions in type 2 diabetes, obesity, and oncology, we perform this work in three specific aims: 1) Develop semi-automated trial screening for identifying and aggregating trials relevant to a clinical intervention; 2) Extract adverse event and safety outcomes data from results reported in the registry; and 3) Perform validation studies to assess detection of adverse events and performance of semi- automated meta-analyses of safety outcomes. Methods developed in this project will facilitate timely, broad- scale use of trial results reported on ClinicalTrials.gov in order to augment the availability of comprehensive and timely drug safety data. All methods will be made publicly available in order to support adverse event monitoring and systematic reviews of drug interventions. Project Narrative The availability of results from clinical trials is frequently incomplete or delayed, limiting the evidence available to clinicians making treatment decisions. When results on the safety of interventions, such as drugs, are not properly disseminated, patients may be exposed to harm. National policies require comprehensive and timely reporting of trial results in trial registries (e.g. ClinicalTrials.gov), representing a novel data type that could be used for drug safety surveillance. However, the use of these data has remained limited to date. We propose innovative informatics methods to enable access and analysis of this emerging data source in order to augment the availability of comprehensive and timely drug safety data.",Coupling Results Data from ClinicalTrials.gov and Bibliographic Databases to Accelerate Evidence Synthesis,10136717,R01LM012976,"['Bibliography ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Data Sources ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Patients ', ' Publishing ', ' Records ', ' Registries ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Standardization ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Bibliographic Databases ', ' Information Retrieval ', ' Information extraction ', ' Drug Monitoring ', ' Unified Medical Language System ', ' UMLS ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Policies ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' rosiglitazone ', ' Avandia ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Evidence Based Medicine ', ' Performance ', ' Informatics ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' validation studies ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Vioxx ', ' Rofecoxib ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Health Informatics ', ' consumer informatics ', ' Public Health Informatics ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' International ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' systematic review ', ' vector ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Consumption ', ' Coupling ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' drug testing ', ' drug detection ', ' screening ', ' cluster trial ', ' Adverse drug event ', ' trial design ', ' concept mapping ', ' concept maps ', ' treatment arm ', ' intervention arm ', ' Infrastructure ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' adverse event monitoring ', ' medication safety ', ' drug safety ', ' pharmaceutical safety ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' safety outcomes ', ' ']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,328000,MA-07
"MR Fingerprinting for Epilepsy Abstract Epilepsy affects 65 million people worldwide; approximately 30% of them do not respond to medications but can be cured by surgery. Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), a major pathology for medically intractable epilepsies, is frequently missed by visual analysis of the conventional MRI, making surgical treatment very difficult. We propose to develop a novel quantitative MRI acquisition and analysis framework specific for epilepsy patients, which could provide more sensitive and specific measures of brain structure, thereby improving FCD detection and subtype prediction. To this end, the quantitative framework will be developed and validated in three steps: (1) Develop high-resolution Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) scan that allows simultaneous quantification of multiple tissue property maps efficiently, accurately and precisely. These quantitative maps have shown to be more sensitive and specific on detecting and characterizing subtle signal abnormalities. (2) Develop image post-processing methods to analyze quantitative maps, which will provide quantitative measurements that highlight additional morphological features, such as gray-white boundary blurring, abnormal cortical thickness and folding. (3) Develop machine-learning-based feature screening and prediction tools to characterize group-level features differentiating FCD subtypes, and predict individual-level FCD location and subtyping. Because detection and subtype prediction of FCD are both associated with seizure outcomes, epileptologists can use this tool to provide more personalized and customized counseling. The result of our proposed work promises a paradigm shift by converting the current standard-care of visual/qualitative MRI review to a quantitative framework, including data acquisition, post-processing and decision support tool, that would eventually lead to better treatment planning, reduction in unnecessary pre-surgical evaluation tests (especially invasive evaluation), and improved post-operative seizure outcomes in patients with devastating and disabling medically intractable epilepsy. The quantitative nature of our acquisition/analysis methods also makes it possible to be uniformly adopted by other centers with high consistency.

"A Pragmatic Latent Variable Learning Approach Aligned with Clinical Practice Abstract With growing interest in personalized medicine and the rise of machine learning, constructing good risk prediction and prognostic models has been drawing renewed attention. In this development, much effort is concentrated in identifying good predictors of patient outcomes, although the same level of rigor is often absent in improving the outcome side of prediction. The majority of popular supervised techniques (e.g., regularized logistic regression and its variations), which can be readily applied in risk model development, assumes that the prediction target is a clear single outcome measured at a single time point. In clinical reality, patient outcomes are often complex, multivariate, and measured with errors. Even when a target is a relatively clear univariate outcome (e.g., death, cancer, diabetes, etc), the process that leads to this ultimate outcome often involves complex intermediate outcomes, where predicting and understanding this intermediate process can be crucial in providing effective care and preventing negative ultimate outcomes. The situation calls for a ﬂexible learning framework that can easily incorporate this important but neglected aspect in model development - better characterizing and constructing prediction targets before building prediction models.  Focusing on risk labels as prediction targets, we propose a pragmatic 3-stage learning approach, where we sequentially 1) generate latent labels, 2) validate them using explicit validators, and 3) go on with supervised learning with labeled data. Latent variable (LV) strategies used in Satge 1 have great potentials in handling complex outcome information. The unsupervised nature of LV strategies makes highly ﬂexible data synthesis and organization possible. The same nature, however, can also be seen as esoteric and subjective, which is not desirable in situations where transparency and reproducibility are of great concern such as in risk prediction. As a practical solution to this problem, we propose the use of explicit clinical validators, which not only makes LV-based labels closely aligned with contemporary science and clinical practice, but also makes it possible to automatically validate and narrow a large pool of candidate labels. With the goal of developing a practical and transparent system of learning and inference for clinical research and practice, we formed a highly interdisciplinary team of researchers with expertise in latent variable modeling, machine learning, psychometrics and causal inference along with clinical/substantive expertise. Our streamlined learning framework focuses on direct and transparent validation of latent variable solutions to ensure clear communication across risk model developers, clinical researchers and practitioners. The project ultimately aims to improve personalized treatment and care by improving risk prediction. Narrative This project intends to develop a pragmatic learning and risk predction framework that will facilitate utilization of multivariate data collected from research and health care services, which otherwise is underutilized in developing methods to improve personalized care of future patients.

"Data Driven Methods for Missing Data Imputation in Surgical Disparities Research Project Summary/Abstract Disparities in health and health care have been a longstanding challenge in the United States. One specific area of medical care in which racial/ethnic disparities have been identified is total joint arthroplasty (TJA), particularly total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA). Large, population based studies necessary to address healthcare disparities can be costly and difficult to perform, and may be compromised by sampling strategies and patient selection biases. Efficient alternatives are publicly-available nationally representative databases such as the HCUP State Inpatient Databases (SID) and National Inpatient Sample (NIS). The SID provide information on all patients admitted to hospitals within participating states, allowing for comparison of health care access among many vulnerable populations, across states, and over time. The NIS is the largest publicly-available all-payer inpatient health care database in the nation. It is sampled from the SID through a complex survey design, yielding national estimates of health care utilization, quality, and outcomes. A significant limitation of the NIS and the SID is the quantity of missing data. In particular, “patient race”, a key indicator for health disparities research, has a high proportion of missingness. Multiple imputation (MI) approaches have been increasingly popular for providing sound statistical methods to account for missing data. When conducting MI, it is suggested that imputation models be as general as data allow them to be, in order to accommodate a wide range of subsequent analyses of imputed data sets. This requires all relationships that are going to be investigated in any subsequent analysis, such as nonlinearities and interactions, to be included in the imputation model. Unfortunately, traditional MI methods, such as the multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE), are built on parametric imputation models. These models are often not flexible enough to capture interactions and nonlinearities in high dimensional and large scale data settings. Unlike parametric models, machine learning techniques (MLTs) are model-free methods, and thus provide flexibility for missing data imputation. MLTs use algorithms that automatically and iteratively learn from all data to detect statistical dependencies in observations without being explicitly programmed where to look. The goal of this study is to make the two HCUP databases a more useful resource for the study of surgical disparities and other areas of medicine. Accordingly, we propose novel MI methods based on MLTs to impute missing data in the SID and the NIS, and to use the imputed datasets to measure racial disparity in TKA. Project Narrative It would be challenging to approach the goal of eliminating healthcare disparities without identifying disparities and analyzing the underlying causes using nationally representative databases such as the HCUP SID and NIS. This proposal imputes missing data for surgical disparities research using the two databases.",Data Driven Methods for Missing Data Imputation in Surgical Disparities Research,10199999,R01MD013901,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Trees ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hybrids ', ' Inpatients ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Selection Bias ', ' sound ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Medical Research ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' knee replacement arthroplasty ', ' Knee arthroplasty ', ' Knee joint replacement operation ', ' Knee replacement ', ' Total Knee Replacement ', ' total knee arthroplasty ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Replacement Arthroplasty ', ' Arthroplasty ', ' Joint Prosthesis Implantation ', ' joint arthroplasty ', ' joint replacement ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Discipline ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Patient Selection ', ' Companions ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hip Prosthesis Implantation ', ' hip arthroplasty ', ' hip joint replacement ', ' hip replacement ', ' hip replacement arthroplasty ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Techniques ', ' Musculoskeletal ', ' Equation ', ' success ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' population-based study ', ' population-level study ', ' studies of populations ', ' study of the population ', ' Population Study ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' administrative database ', ' administrative data base ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' usability ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' racial disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' disparate health care ', ' disparate healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' health care availability ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' high dimensionality ', ' surgery outcome ', ' surgical outcome ', ' neural network ', ' autoencoder ', ' autoencoding neural network ', ' random forest ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' automated algorithm ', ' automatic algorithm ', ' underserved community ', ' under served community ', ' surgical disparities ', ' ']",NIMHD,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,241504,DC-98
"Dynamics of long range network interactions  in focal epilepsy PROJECT SUMMARY Epilepsy is the world’s most prominent serious brain disorder, affecting nearly 50 million people worldwide. For about 30% of these patients, seizures remain poorly controlled despite optimal medical management, with attendant effects on health and quality of life. In order to enable advances in the therapeutic management of epilepsy, a thorough understanding of how cellular processes that drive seizures are linked to large-scale network effects is needed. While seizures impact large brain areas and often multiple lobes, the driving processes span regions on the scale of millimeters. These have been well characterized in animal models, but the relevance to human seizures, i.e. how seizures are driven by brain signals from small-scale processes remains unclear. Instead, the view that naturally-occurring seizures may be attributable instead to large-scale neural mass effects (i.e., the epileptic network) is a subject of ongoing debate. Previously, we defined a key role for surround inhibition in shaping EEG recordings of seizures at the onset site and on small spatial scales. We now propose that surround inhibition has a dual role. On a millimeter scale, its abrupt failure permits the advance of a seizure. At long distances from the seizure focus, strong local inhibition serves to mask the excitatory effects of seizures and may help to hasten seizure termination, while weakened inhibition may permit emergence of ictal activity at a distant, noncontiguous seizure site. Multiple seizure foci may go unrecognized with standard EEG interpretation methods, and are likely a critical factor in epilepsy surgery failures. We hypothesize that once established, multiple ictal generators behave as delay-coupled oscillators, demonstrating activity that is synchronized or even temporally reversed. This results in complex and at times counterintuitive network behavior that can be challenging to reverse engineer from EEG recordings. Typically, however, even intracranial EEG recordings provide only a limited view of neural activity. In this project, an interdisciplinary research group with combined expertise in epilepsy, clinical neurophysiology, computational modeling, and mathematics will conduct a comprehensive study of the neuronal contributors to epileptic networks utilizing a unique combined dataset of simultaneous microelectrode and macroelectrode recordings of human seizures. Using a machine learning approach, we will apply this information to develop a multivariate EEG biomarker based on the inferred source of EEG discharges, high frequency oscillations, and very low frequency (DC) shifts and assess its predictive value for post-resection surgical outcome. We anticipate that the project will lead to a theoretical framework for rational development of innovative strategies for developing interventions to control seizures. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to identify the cellular mechanisms of epileptic networks, a critical barrier to developing treatments based on epileptic network analysis and manipulation. An interdisciplinary team of researchers will address this problem by analyzing and modeling multiscale voltage data from epilepsy patients, and utilizing the results to develop a new multivariate biomarker for seizure-generating brain areas.",Dynamics of long range network interactions  in focal epilepsy,10198042,R01NS084142,"['Affect ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Decision Making ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Engineering ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Partial Epilepsies ', ' Focal Epilepsy ', ' Focal Seizure Disorder ', ' Localization-Related Epilepsy ', ' Partial Seizure Disorder ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' High Frequency Oscillation ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Masks ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Methods ', ' Microelectrodes ', ' Miniaturized Electrodes ', ' Study models ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Terminology ', ' Patients ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Seizures ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Universities ', ' Weight ', ' Generations ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Failure ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' millimeter ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Distant ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' voltage ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Impact Seizures ', ' partial seizure ', ' Focal Seizure ', ' lobes ', ' Lobe ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Collection ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' multi-scale modeling ', ' multiscale modeling ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' parallel computer ', ' parallel computation ', ' parallel computing ', ' minimally invasive ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' surgery outcome ', ' surgical outcome ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' support vector machine ', ' ']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,612436,NY-13
"mIQa: A Highly Scalable and Customizable Platform for Medical Image Quality Assessment - Phase II 1 Project Summary NIH is increasing its investment in large, multi-center brain MRI studies via projects such as the recently announced BRAIN initiative. The success of these studies depends on the quality of MRIs and the resulting image measurements, regardless of sample size. Even though quality control of MRIs and corresponding measurements could be outsourced, most neuroscience studies rely on in-house procedures that combine automatically generated scores with manually guided checks, such as visual inspection. Implementing these procedures typically requires combining several software systems. For example, the NIH NIAAA- and BD2K- funded Data Analysis Resource (DAR) of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) uses XNAT to consolidate the structural, diffusion, and functional MRIs acquired across five sites, and has also developed their own custom software package to comply with study requirements for a multi-tier, quality control (QC) workflow. However, these custom, one-off tools lack support for the multi-site QC workflows that will come with the unified platform that MIQA represents: a design that supports collaboration and sharing, and strong cohesion between technologies. To improve the effectiveness of QC efforts specific to multi-center neuroimaging studies, we will develop a widely accessible and broadly compatible software platform that simplifies the creation of custom QC workflows in compliance with study requirements, provides core functionality for performing QC of medical images, and automatically generates documentation compliant with the FAIR principle, i.e., making scientific results findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.  Specifically, our multi-site, web-based software platform for Medical Image Quality Assurance (MIQA) will enable efficient and accurate QC processing by leveraging open-source, state-of-the-art web interface technologies, such as a web-based dataset caching system and machine learning to aid in QC processes. Users will be able to configure workflows that not only reflect the specific requirements of medical imaging studies but also minimize the time spent on labor-intensive operations, such as visually reviewing scans. Issue tracking technology will enhance communication between geographically-distributed team members, as they can easily share image annotations and receive automated notifications of outstanding QC issues. The system will be easy to deploy as it will be able to interface with various imaging storage backends, such as local file systems and XNAT. While parts of this functionality have been developed elsewhere, MIQA is unique as it provides a unified, standard interface for efficient QC setup, maintenance, and review for projects analyzing multiple, independently managed data sources.  The usefulness of this unique QC system will be demonstrated on increasing the efficiency of the diverse QC team of the multi-center NCANDA study. Narrative The goal of this proposal is to develop a web-based, multi-site, open-source platform for Medical Image Quality Assurance (MIQA) to address the QC needs of geographically diverse teams using small and large medical image-based studies alike. MIQA will enable efficient and accurate QC processing by levering state-of-the-art machine learning, data management, and web interface technologies. Our effort will minimize the time spent on labor-intensive reviews and analysis operations by supporting team-oriented reviewing that is guided by highly customizable workflows seamlessly interacting with existing data management systems.",mIQa: A Highly Scalable and Customizable Platform for Medical Image Quality Assessment - Phase II,10183329,R44MH119022,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Archives ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communication ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diffusion ', ' Evaluation Studies ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Intelligence ', ' Investments ', ' Iowa ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maintenance ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Peer Review ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Quality Control ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Running ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Generations ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' quality assurance ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Visual ', ' Licensing ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Active Learning ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Funding ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Notification ', ' Scanning ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' data management ', ' success ', ' cohesion ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Documentation ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' software systems ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism ', ' NIAAA ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' image archival system ', ' Image data archive ', ' image archive ', ' image library ', ' image repository ', ' imaging repository ', ' picture archive ', ' Four-dimensional ', ' 4-dimensional ', ' web interface ', ' open source ', ' operation ', ' Data Provenance ', ' dexterity ', ' BRAIN initiative ', ' Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies initiative ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' Big Data to Knowledge ', ' BD2K ', ' FAIR principles ', ' FAIR data ', ' FAIR guiding principles ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable ', ' annotation  system ', ' annotation framework ', ' annotation tool ', ' imaging study ', ' deep learning ', ' learning algorithm ', ' Data Management Resources ', ' Data Management System ', ' Visualization ', ' three-dimensional visualization ', ' 3-D visualization ', ' 3-dimensional visualization ', ' 3D visualization ', ' ']",NIMH,"KITWARE, INC.",R44,2021,797476,NY-20
"Biomarker-Based Tools for Treatment Response Decision Support of Bladder Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Bladder cancer is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among both men and women. Bladder cancer causes over 16,870 deaths per year in the United States with 79,030 new bladder cancer cases diagnosed in 2017. A reliable assessment of the response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying tumors that do not respond and allowing the patient a chance of alternative treatment. We have successfully developed a computer decision support system (CDSS-T) for monitoring of bladder cancer treatment response. A quantitative image analysis tool for bladder cancer (QIBC) that quantifies the bladder gross tumor volume (GTV) and image characteristics is an important component of CDSS-T. Advanced machine learning techniques are used to merge the GTV and radiomic biomarkers into an effective predictive model. The goal of this project is to validate the effectiveness of CDSS-T as an aid to the radiologists and the oncologists in assessment of bladder cancer change as a result of treatment through pilot clinical trials. We will (1) perform a preparatory clinical trial with the clinicians at UM, which will simulate the real prospective clinical trial with high quality retrospective data, (2) deploy the QIBC and CDSS-T tools at the three collaborating clinical sites, (3) use the QIBC and CDSS-T tools at the different clinical sites in the prospective pilot clinical trial (standard clinical workflow) utilizing the decision support in parallel to the standard clinical patient care, and (4) analyze the impact of the QIBC and CDSS-T tools on the clinicians' performance in the pilot clinical trial and assess the potential impact on clinical outcome. We hypothesize that this innovative approach can improve clinicians' accuracy, consistency and efficiency in bladder GTV estimation and assessment of treatment response. To test these hypotheses, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) to evaluate the performance of the QIBC and CDSS-T tools on cases not previously used, new to the system, for both the prediction accuracy and the automatic standalone functionality, refine and optimize the design of the user interface based on clinicians' feedback after their hands-on experience with the system to ensure its practicality and robustness, familiarize clinicians with the performance of the CDSS-T tools and the interpretation of the CDSS-T outputs as a part of user training for the prospective pilot clinical trial, (2) to optimize the QIBC and CDSS-T tools for the clinical workflow at the different clinical sites based on the site clinicians' feedback in order to operate efficiently and in a standalone mode by clinicians, (3) to record the clinicians' predicted outcomes without and with the use of the tools during the pilot clinical trials, estimate the accuracy of assessing response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the current clinical treatment paradigm by comparing the estimated response to the histopathologically determined response after radical cystectomy, and (4) to statistically analyze the impact of the QIBC and CDSS-T tools on the performance of the clinicians in the pilot clinical trial and statistically assess the potential impact on clinical outcome. PROJECT NARRATIVE We have previously developed a computer decision support system for (CDSS-T) for monitoring of bladder cancer treatment response. If successfully deployed and utilized, CDSS-T will be a useful tool to aid clinicians in improving the accuracy and reproducibility of tumor treatment response assessment. Improving the reliability in assessment of treatment response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying patients who do not respond to preserve their physical condition, thus allowing them to seek alternative treatment, which may reduce morbidity and improve the quality of life of patients suffering from bladder cancer. In addition, the multi-site pilot clinical trial will provide an excellent opportunity to experience the process of bringing laboratory research from bench to bedside, which will serve as a valuable guide for future development of clinically practical tools for various diseases.",Biomarker-Based Tools for Treatment Response Decision Support of Bladder Cancer,10152531,U01CA232931,"['Bladder ', ' Bladder Urinary System ', ' urinary bladder ', ' Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder ', ' Bladder Cancer ', ' Malignant Bladder Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Bladder ', ' Urinary Bladder Cancer ', ' Urinary Bladder Malignant Tumor ', ' Bladder Neoplasm ', ' Bladder Tumors ', ' Urinary Bladder Neoplasm ', ' Urinary Bladder Tumor ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Computers ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Interobserver Variability ', ' Inter-Observer Variability ', ' Inter-Observer Variation ', ' Interobserver Variations ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Radical Cystectomy ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Oncologist ', ' radiologist ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Tumor Volume ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Induction Therapy ', ' NEOADJ ', ' Neoadjuvant ', ' Neoadjuvant Treatment ', ' Neoadjuvant Therapy ', ' Decision Support Systems ', ' response ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' clinical research site ', ' clinical site ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer imaging ', ' oncologic imaging ', ' oncology imaging ', ' tumor imaging ', ' cancer type ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' bench to bedside ', ' bench bed side ', ' bench bedside ', ' bench to bed side ', ' bench to clinic ', ' chemotherapy ', ' tumor ', ' alternative treatment ', ' clinical care ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' support tools ', ' responders and non-responders ', ' responders from non-responders ', ' responders or non-responders ', ' responders versus non-responders ', ' responders vs non-responders ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' radiomics ', ' clinical development ', ' clinical decision support ', ' preservation ', ' effectiveness validation ', ' validate effectiveness ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2021,625260,MI-12
"Comprehensive CT Guided Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery Project Summary     Coronary bypass graft surgery (CABG) improves the lives of patients with coronary disease (CAD) as a group,  but 20% of patients remain symptomatic one year after surgery. In clinical practice CABG decisions are largely  driven by stenosis severity determined from invasive angiography despite the known relevance of functional  CAD  parameters.  This  practical  impasse  will  continue  to  exist  without  clinically  available,  high-­resolution,  quantitative functional imaging, and a better understanding of the clinical outcomes in relation to anatomical  (angiography)  and  functional  (ischemia,  scar  tissue)  factors.  The  long-­term  goal  is  to  improve  outcome  of  CABG  through  personalized  imaging-­guided  care.  The  overall  objective  of  this  proposal  is  to  identify  determinants  of  myocardial  flow  restoration  (ischemia  reduction),  and  develop  integrated  imaging  tools  for  individualized,  lesion-­specific  CABG  decision-­making,  and  computational  flow  simulations  based  on  the  patient’s  anatomy  and  function  to  predict  the  hemodynamic  outcome.  Supported  by  studies  using  invasive  FFR-­guided  CABG,  the  rationale  for  the  proposed  research  is  that  integration  of  anatomical  (angiography)  and functional information (ischemia, scar tissue) will identify individual coronary vessels that will benefit from  revascularization, and individual optimization of surgical procedures by flow simulations will maximize clinical  benefit  of  CABG  for  patients  with  CAD.  Supported  by  promising  preliminary  data,  three  specific  aims  are  proposed:  1)  Prospectively  identify  angiographic,  functional  and  clinical  baseline  determinants  of  outcome  after CABG, defined as improvement of myocardial perfusion (ischemia reduction) and angina symptoms;; 2)  Develop  and  validate  a  comprehensive  imaging  strategy  and  clinically  applicable  tool  that  integrate  high-­ resolution  angiographic  and  quantitative  functional  information  (ischemia,  viability)  for  per-­vessel/lesion  revascularization  decisions;;  3)  Develop  and  validate  new  multi-­parametric  computational  flow  simulations,  with incorporation of functional imaging data, which allows for prediction of individual hemodynamic outcome  and  ultimately  surgical  optimization  based  on  virtual  hemodynamic  results.  This  approach  is  innovative  because  new  imaging  techniques  will  advance  the  field’s  understanding  of  CABG  physiology,  and  new  clinically applicable tools will be developed for comprehensive clinical decision-­making and optimized surgical  planning. The acquired knowledge and developed tools are applicable to other vascular contexts, and may  also  be  instrumental  for  new  therapeutic  innovations.  The  proposed  research  is  significant  because  identification  of  CABG  outcome  determinants,  and  new  solutions  for  comprehensive  decision-­making  and  procedural  guidance,  have  the  potential  to  improve  the  effectiveness  (by  complete  functional  revascularization)  and  efficiency  of  CABG  (by  avoiding  futile  grafts).  For  a  large  group  of  patients,  these  innovations  will improve  the patient-­valued  benefit  of  CABG (complications, symptoms),  and also decrease  cost by improved efficiency of care.     Project Narrative    The proposed research is relevant to the public health because identification of CABG outcome determinants,  and  development  of  diagnostic  solutions  for  comprehensive  decision-­making  and  procedural  guidance  of  CABG  surgery,  can  help  achieve  complete  functional  revascularization  and  restoration  of  myocardial  blood  flow  in  more  patients.  Thus,  the  proposed  research  is  relevant  to  the  NIH’s  mission  that  pertains  to  the  discovery of fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of  that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. ",Comprehensive CT Guided Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery,10093121,R01HL141712,"['Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', '

"Accounting for Hidden Bias in Vaccine Studies: A Negative Control Framework Project Summary / Abstract The proposed research aims to develop novel causal inference methods to resolve unmeasured confounding bias known to plague vaccine effectiveness and safety studies by leveraging so-called negative control variables widely available in vaccine studies. A negative control outcome is a variable known not to be causally affected by the treatment of interest, while a negative control exposure is a variable known not to causally affect the outcome of interest. Both share a common confounding mechanism as the exposure-outcome pair of primary interest. Examples of negative controls abound in vaccine studies. Such known-null effects form the basis of falsiﬁca- tion strategy to detect unmeasured confounding, however little is known about when and how negative controls can be used to resolve unmeasured confounding bias. We plan to develop principled negative control methods for identiﬁcation and semiparametric estimation of causal effects in the presence of unmeasured confounding, incorporating modern highly adaptive machine learning methods. We also plan to develop negative control meth- ods to detect and quantify causal effects in complex longitudinal and survival settings critical to vaccine studies using routinely collected healthcare data. Finally we plan to apply the proposed methods to evaluate vaccine effectiveness using data collected from a pioneering test-negative design platform and to monitor vaccine safety using electronic health record data. Successful completion of the proposed research will equip investigators with paradigm-shifting methods to unlock the full potential of contemporary healthcare data, encourage investigators to routinely check for evidence of confounding bias, and ultimately improve the validity of scientiﬁc research.

"Opioid Support and Risk Reduction Online Platform Project Summary  This proposal seeks to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of developing an online support and risk reduction platform to prevent opioid misuse and abuse. This is an urgent area of research; opioid misuse/abuse has reached epidemic proportions in recent years. It is linked to causing the largest drug epidemic in the history of the United States and has become the top priority of the US Surgeon General. Because the opioid crisis (including heroin use) is believed to have largely originated from chronic pain patients' opioid prescriptions, this application will initially focus on the needs of chronic pain patients on opioids who are high risk for addiction and overdose. Later versions of the technology will expand to the broader population of people affected by the opioid crisis, including heroin users.  Although low cost, novel interventions are needed to reduce opioid misuse and abuse, before they lead to addiction and fatal overdose, only 6 behavioral (non-pharmacological) randomized controlled trials have been successfully conducted in this area to date (with our group having conducted one of them), creating a tremendous need for solutions to the opioid crisis. Building off extensive preliminary research that our team conducted, including piloting technology-based behavior change interventions among chronic pain patients, and developing artificial intelligence (AI)-based prediction models of opioid outcomes, we propose to design and test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of an online peer social support and clinical counseling community to reduce opioid misuse/abuse among chronic pain sufferers.  This is a highly innovative product with scalable commercialization potential and impact as 1) no software platform exists that has been shown to reduce opioid misuse/abuse risk factors, 2) it is evidenced- based, supported by more than a decade of scientific research conducted by our team, and 3) is highly accessible, helping to address the time, cost, and stigma that are constant barriers to opioid prevention and treatment.  Our team includes the former CFO of Epic Systems (and two-time successful entrepreneur), the Associate Chief Medical Information Officer for Cedars-Sinai, a patent attorney at a large Silicon Valley intellectual property firm specializing in digital health portfolios, as well as clinical, data science/statistical, and research experts who conducted more than a decade of formative research leading up to this application. Funding for this Phase 1 SBIR is needed before scaling development and testing more widely among potential health system and insurer customers.

"Characterization of Novel Neural Respiratory Circuit to Counter Opioid-Induced Respiratory Depression PROJECT SUMMARY We have identified a novel property of the cervical spinal cord that modulates respiratory activity, both the rate and depth of breathing, such that the respiratory drive in opioid-suppressed states in mice and humans increases during spinal cord epidural stimulation. Respiratory rates are increased upon epidural stimulation of specific cervical spinal cord locations when there is spontaneous breathing, and rhythmic breathing can be generated when the respiratory state is depressed and spontaneous breathing is absent. This is an important observation because the brainstem, which contains the rhythm-generating center for respiration, is a difficult area for surgical and therapeutic access. If there are other accessible neural regions by surgery (i.e. epidural stimulation) or non-invasive means (i.e. transcutaneous stimulation), for example in the cervical spine, that influence respiration or contain their own rhythmic respiratory elements, these may represent potential therapeutic targets to reverse opioid-induced respiratory depression. Thus, we have proposed a strategy to characterize this novel cervical respiratory circuit. First, we will conduct extensive electrical mapping of the respiratory responsive elements of the cervical spinal cord in mice aided by machine learning strategies, and we will characterize the mechanistic basis for this response, the relation to opioid receptors to the respiratory response, and identity neurons responsible for the respiratory response using optogenetic techniques. Guided by the animal studies, we will then confirm the cervical respiratory responsive loci in humans. Third, we will subject the identified respiratory competent regions to increasing doses of opioid to further characterize the dose-response profile of these regions. Fourth, we will assess the feasibility and practical translation of this strategy to reverse opioid-induced respiratory depression in three patients implanted with spinal cord stimulators. These studies will provide an anatomical and electrophysiological characterization of the respiratory circuit within the cervical spine and provide practical information for the treatment of opioid-induced respiratory depression. The results obtained, especially because they are obtained in humans, will have an immediate translational impact on our understanding of the respiratory circuit that may, in turn, prevent deaths due to opioid overdose. PROJECT NARRATIVE Opioid overdose often leads to death due to suppression of respiration; therefore, strategies to prevent respiratory depression in addition to treatment of opioid addiction are necessary to prevent deaths in the opioid-use epidemic. Respiratory suppression occurs because neurons in the brain that drive breathing are inhibited (turned off) by narcotics; thus, understanding the neural pathways for breathing will allow us to devise effective neuromodulatory strategies to treat opioid-induced respiratory depression. We have proposed to characterize a novel breathing circuit that, when activated by stimulation of the cervical spine, has the potential to be an effective treatment of opioid-induced respiratory depression, and it is our hope that findings from these studies may lead to new and more effective treatments for respiratory depression secondary to opioid overdoses.",Characterization of Novel

"Patient Safety Event Surveillance Using Machine Learning and Free Text Clinical Notes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The proposed project aims to make healthcare safer through collection of patient-centered outcomes as the input data to support a safety and improvement model of the Learning Health System (LHS). The project will accomplish these aims by leveraging existing machine learning methods to classify free text documents, such as clinician notes, for the presence or absence of specific events of interest. The project shares this focus with two long-term objectives. The first broad project goal is to collect important data to address knowledge gaps in the incidence and clinical epidemiology of 5 serious pediatric inpatient healthcare acquired conditions (HACs). These 5 HACs are: peripheral IV infiltrates, venous thromboembolisms (VTEs), pressure injuries, patient falls, and incidents involving harm to providers. The second goal is to evaluate a novel approach to routine patient safety event surveillance that is scalable, transferrable, adaptable to other conditions and settings, and with low cost of sustainable ongoing operation. The project has two specific aims to achieve these goals:  Aim 1: Implement enhanced surveillance for 5 pediatric HACs. Compare characteristics  of previously and newly identified cases. Describe high-risk populations.  Aim 2: Estimate completeness of existing systems. Evaluate effects of enhanced  surveillance on quality improvement activities; incidence of HACs; and cost to operate  system, including staff time and resources. The project team has developed a machine learning interface implemented in open license Windows software. The team has a lengthy track record making these methods accessible to clinicians and lay users in research, clinical operations, quality improvement, and injury prevention settings. The current project proposes an innovative application of these technologies, methods, and tools to the important problem of patient safety surveillance. An expected outcome of this project will be substantial advance in knowledge for each of the 5 pediatric HACs proposed for enhanced surveillance. Results will be reported in terms of existing data completeness and clinical epidemiology. Findings will directly address concerns over limitations of existing data sources and thereby drive patient safety improvement activities. An additional expected outcome will be the rigorous evaluation of a novel approach to patient safety surveillance. This will include analysis of the costs and benefits of enhanced surveillance with machine learning versus current approaches, and the cost-effectiveness of the approach compared to reliance on existing data, and external validation at a partner community hospital. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project addresses important challenges to reduce common sources of harm in pediatric healthcare, namely the “Healthcare-Acquired Conditions (HACs)” monitored by the National Solutions for Patient Safety quality improvement initiative. It uses a new approach to identify previously unreported safety events that affect hospitalized pediatric patients. The findings from these studies will identify high-risk patient populations and new approaches for quality improvement to reduce the frequency of these events of harm among hospitalized children.",Patient Safety Event Surveillance Using Machine Learning and Free Text Clinical Notes,10202727,R01HS026246,[''],AHRQ,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,396733,MA-07
"Advanced End-to-End Relation Extraction with Deep Neural Networks ABSTRACT Relations linking various biomedical entities constitute a crucial resource that enables biomedical data science applications and knowledge discovery. Relational information spans the translational science spectrum going from biology (e.g., protein–protein interactions) to translational bioinformatics (e.g., gene–disease associations), and eventually to clinical care (e.g., drug–drug interactions). Scientists report newly discovered relations in nat- ural language through peer-reviewed literature and physicians may communicate them in clinical notes. More recently, patients are also reporting side-effects and adverse events on social media. With exponential growth in textual data, advances in biomedical natural language processing (BioNLP) methods are gaining prominence for biomedical relation extraction (BRE) from text. Most current efforts in BRE follow a pipeline approach containing named entity recognition (NER), entity normalization (EN), and relation classiﬁcation (RC) as subtasks. They typically suffer from error snowballing — errors in a component of the pipeline leading to more downstream errors — resulting in lower performance of the overall BRE system. This situation has lead to evaluation of different BRE substaks conducted in isolation. In this proposal we make a strong case for strictly end-to-end evaluations where relations are to be produced from raw text. We propose novel deep neural network architectures that model BRE in an end-to-end fashion and directly identify relations and corresponding entity spans in a single pass. We also extend our architectures to n-ary and cross-sentence settings where more than two entities may need to be linked even as the relation is expressed across multiple sentences. We also propose to create two new gold standard BRE datasets, one for drug–disease treatment relations and another ﬁrst of a kind dataset for combination drug therapies. Our main hypothesis is that our end-to-end extraction models will yield supe- rior performance when compared with traditional pipelines. We test this through (1). intrinsic evaluations based on standard performance measures with several gold standard datasets and (2). extrinsic application oriented assessments of relations extracted with use-cases in information retrieval, question answering, and knowledge base completion. All software and data developed as part of this project will be made available for public use and we hope this will foster rigorous end-to-end benchmarking of BRE systems. NARRATIVE Relations connecting biomedical entities are at the heart of biomedical research given they encapsulate mech- anisms of disease etiology, progression, and treatment. As most such relations are ﬁrst disclosed in textual narratives (scientiﬁc literature or clinical notes), methods to extract and represent them in a structured format are essential to facilitate applications such as hypotheses generation, question answering, and information retrieval. The high level objective of this project is to develop and evaluate novel end-to-end supervised machine learning methods for biomedical relation extraction using latest advances in deep neural networks.",Advanced End-to-End Relation Extraction with Deep Neural Networks,10200889,R01LM013240,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Combination Drug Therapy ', ' Polychemotherapy ', ' combination chemotherapy ', ' combination pharmacotherapy ', ' combined drug therapy ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Gold ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Hand ', ' Heart ', ' Information Sciences ', ' Joints ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Names ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Terminology ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Physicians ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Semantics ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Standardization ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' Trees ', ' Generations ', ' Information Retrieval ', ' Information extraction ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Encapsulated ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Review Literature ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Distant ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Drug Interactions ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Data ', ' Intramural Research ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' new drug target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new therapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' clinical care ', ' natural language ', ' Knowledge Discovery ', ' social media ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' neural network ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' neural network architecture ', ' neural net architecture ', ' side effect ', ' off-label use ', ' off-label application ', ' off-label prescribing ', ' biomedical data science ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R01,2021,332681,KY-06
"Human and Machine Learning for Customized Control of Assistive Robots PROJECT SUMMARY This application will result in a technological platform that re-empowers persons with severe paralysis, by allowing them to independently control a wide spectrum of robotic actions. Severe paralysis is devastating, and chronic—and reliance on caregivers is persistent. Assistive machines such as wheelchairs and robotic arms offer a groundbreaking path to independence: where control over their environment and interactions is returned to the person.  However, to operate complex machines like robotic arms and hands typically poses a difﬁcult learning challenge and requires complex control signals—and the commercial control interfaces accessible to persons with severe paralysis (e.g. sip-and-puff, switch-based head arrays) are not adequate. As a result, assistive robotic arms remain largely inaccessible to those with severe paralysis—arguably the population who would beneﬁt from them most.  The purpose of the proposed study is to provide people with tetraplegia with the means to control robotic arms with their available body mobility, while concurrently promoting the exercise of available body motions and the maintenance of physical health. Control interfaces that generate a unique map from a user's body motions to control signals for a machine offer a customized interaction, however these interfaces have only been used to issue low-dimensional (2-D) control signals whereas more complex machines require higher-dimensional (e.g. 6-D) signals. We propose an approach that leverages robotics autonomy and machine learning in order to aid the end-user in learning how to issue effective higher-dimensional control signals through body motions. Speciﬁcally, initially the human issues a lower- dimensional control signal and robotics autonomy is used to bridge the gap by taking over whatever is not covered by the human's control signal. Help from the robotics autonomy is then progressively scaled back, automatically, to cover fewer and fewer control dimensions as the user becomes more skilled.  The ﬁrst piece to our approach deals with how to extract control signals from the human, using the body-machine interface. The development and optimization of decoding procedures for controlling a robotic arm using residual body motions will be addressed under Speciﬁc Aim 1. The second piece to our approach deals with how to interpret control signals from a human within a paradigm that shares control between the human and robotics autonomy. To identify which shared-control formulations most effectively utilize the human's control signals will be the topic of Speciﬁc Aim 2. The ﬁnal piece to our approach deals with how to adapt the shared-control paradigm so that more control is transferred to the human over time. This adaptation is necessary for the human's learning process, since the goal in the end is for the human to be able to fully control the robotic arm him/herself, and will be assessed under Speciﬁc Aim 3.  At the completion of this project, tetraplegic end-users will be able to operate a robotic arm using their residual body motions, through an interface that both promotes the use of residual body motions (and thus also recovery of motor skill) and adapts with the human as their abilities change over time. By leveraging adaptive robotics autonomy, our application moreover provides a safe mechanism to facilitate learning how to operate the robotic platform. Frequently the more severe a person's motor impairment, the less able they are to operate the very assistive machines, like powered wheelchairs and robotic arms, which might enhance their quality of life. The purpose of the proposed study is to provide people with tetraplegia with the means, through non-invasive technologies, to control robotic arms with their available body mobility, while concurrently promoting the exercise of available body motions and the maintenance of physical health. We propose and study an approach that leverages robot machine learning and autonomy in order to facilitate human motor learning of how to operate a robotic arm using a customized interface, in order to make powered assisted manipulation more accessible to people with severe paralysis. 1",Human and Machine Learning for Customized Control of Assistive Robots,10005323,R01EB024058,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Cerebral Palsy ', ' Computers ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Environment ', ' Exercise ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Head ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Maintenance ', ' Maps ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Motion ', ' Motivation ', ' Motor Skills ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Multiple Sclerosis ', ' Disseminated Sclerosis ', ' insular sclerosis ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Posture ', ' Quadriplegia ', ' Quadriplegic ', ' Tetraplegia ', ' tetraplegic ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Robotics ', ' Self-Help Devices ', ' Assistive Technology ', ' assisted device ', ' assistive device ', ' Shoulder ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Wheelchairs ', ' Wheel Chairs ', ' mobile assistance device ', ' mobile assistance system ', ' mobile assistive device ', ' mobile assistive system ', ' Work ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Powered wheelchair ', ' Electric wheelchair ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Left ', ' Chronic ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Fostering ', ' Robot ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Side ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Palsy ', ' Plegia ', ' paralysis ', ' paralytic ', ' Paralysed ', ' Performance ', ' empowerment ', ' Devices ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' feeding ', ' efficacy evaluation ', ' efficacy analysis ', ' efficacy assessment ', ' efficacy examination ', ' evaluate efficacy ', ' examine efficacy ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' brain machine interface ', ' Spinal cord injured survivor ', ' SCI survivor ', ' spinal cord injury survivor ', ' Population ', ' two-dimensional ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' motor learning ', ' locomotor learning ', ' n-dimensional ', ' motor impairment ', ' movement impairment ', ' movement limitation ', ' arm ', ' body-machine interface ', ' motor recovery ', ' Formulation ', ' robot control ', ' robotic control ', ' high dimensionality ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' assistive robot ', ' ']",NIBIB,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2021,375190,IL-07
"Thalamocortical Responsive Neurostimulation for the Treatment of Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome Project Summary / Abstract  Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) is a devastating form of childhood onset epilepsy with cognitive dysfunction and very frequent generalized onset seizures (GOS) often leading to injury. Driven by the lack of effective therapies and the demonstrated safety and efficacy of brain-responsive stimulation for medically intractable focal onset seizures (FOS), this study will test whether brain-responsive neurostimulation of thalamocortical networks (RNS-TCN) is a feasible strategy to treat LGS. Specifically, the project aims to: (1) acquire preliminary evidence for safety and efficacy in treating GOS of LGS with RNS-TCN; (2) create an interactive therapy-decision support system based on patient-specific computational network models and machine learning to identify optimal lead placement and stimulation parameters.  Using the RNS® System, which is FDA approved for FOS, an early feasibility IDE study will be conducted at 6 epilepsy centers in 20 patients with LGS and medically intractable GOS. The patients will be enrolled in two cohorts of 10, with safety and efficacy milestones in the first cohort governing the enrollment of the second cohort. Patients will have two depth leads placed bilaterally in the centromedian nucleus of the thalamus and two subdural strip leads placed bilaterally on the medial prefrontal cortex. These targets are selected because they are implicated in the onset and spread of GOS in LGS. Leads will be located within each target such that stimulation maximally engages the thalamocortical network, guided by finite-element biophysical models created from structural magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion weighted imaging. The finite-element biophysical models will also be used to identify the initial RNS-TCN stimulation pathway and current amplitude. During the blinded evaluation period patients will be randomized to receive either high-frequency short burst (HFSB) or low-frequency long burst (LFLB) RNS-TCN, then enter a washout period before crossing over to receive the other treatment condition. During the open label period stimulation parameters can be modified at the discretion of the physician. Parameter adjustments will be informed by using a Bayesian optimization model developed for specifically for each patient. All clinical and electrophysiological data collected during the study will be used to identify a biomarker of clinical response; if found, these will aid future epilepsy research and clinical practice. If safety is favorable and there is preliminary evidence for efficacy, then this early experience will inform the design of a future larger feasibility study.  In addition to treating a population in need, this project engages in fundamental discovery of biomarkers in generalized network epilepsies, and develops novel automated therapy selection policies that have the potential to improve the lives of patients with LGS and other seizure disorders. Project Narrative Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) is a devastating form of childhood onset epilepsy characterized by cognitive dysfunction and very frequent generalized onset seizures (GOS) that often lead to injury. Driven by the lack of effective therapies and the demonstrated safety and efficacy of brain-responsive stimulation for treating medically intractable focal onset seizures, this study will test whether brain-responsive neurostimulation can also be used to treat LGS. The intent of the proposed research is to test the safety and preliminary efficacy of responsive neurostimulation of thalamocortical networks (RNS-TCN) involved in GOS, to identify promising detection and stimulation approaches, and to characterize neurophysiological biomarkers of clinical efficacy that will aid future research and clinical practice.",Thalamocortical Responsive Neurostimulation for

"Machine Learning Approach to Identify Candidates for Epilepsy Surgery Project Summary/Abstract Despite the widespread adoption of new drug classes to treat epilepsy, approximately one third of patients do not respond to anti-epileptic medication. Patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) suffer permanent memory and cognitive impairment from uncontrolled seizures. Only 8-10% of patients with DRE obtain long-term seizure freedom. About half of patients with DRE are eligible for surgical treatment, which results in seizure freedom in 58-73% of patients. However, it is difficult to determine when patients with DRE need surgery. DRE has a complex disease course that fluctuates according to weekly and monthly patterns. Further, neurologists report that they lack the resources (i.e. time) needed to analyze and interpret large amounts of electronic health record (EHR) data to determine surgical candidacy. This results in substantial delays in treatment - 6 years in pediatrics and 20 years in adults, on average - and contributes to avoidable morbidity and mortality. Automated systems are capable of assisting clinicians in identifying candidates for epilepsy surgery two years earlier in the disease course. One such system uses natural language processing to analyze free-text neurology notes in a real-time clinical setting. This system was able to increase the rate of surgical candidate identification by 46%, but it could still be improved in two important ways. First, the system is not able to incorporate results from EEG and MRIs - the most influential factors on surgical candidacy - into its recommendations. Second, it does not utilize rich information hidden in structured EHR data that captures epilepsy disease burden. A system that fuses information from all three data sources (neurology notes, EEG and MRI reports, and structured data) would drastically improve the accuracy and impact of the model. In the proposed research, I will first develop a deep learning (DL) approach for fusing multi-modal EHR data. Specifically, I will use recent advances in deep representation learning to produce richer features from both free- text and structured data. I will represent free-text in neurology notes and EEG and MRI reports with word embedding vectors, and medication, procedure, and visit codes with medical concept vectors. I will combine disparate data sources with a deep neural network to produce high-level representations of surgical candidacy. This will enable me to estimate patients' risk of future epilepsy surgery. Second, I will establish the generalizability of this approach using a neighboring hospital's EHR data and validate the system in a clinical setting. This contribution will be significant because it will increase the number of surgical candidates identified earlier in the disease course, thereby reducing epilepsy disease sequelae. This proposal will lay the groundwork for nationwide expansion of the DL system and generate the only automated DL system designed to improve the timeliness of surgical referral rates in the adult population. Project Narrative Automating the identification of patients with epilepsy who would benefit from surgical treatment is imperative to reducing morbidity and mortality from uncontrolled seizures. This research proposal will develop and clinically validate a generalizable deep learning framework for analyzing multi-modal electronic health record data to predict epilepsy surgery candidacy. Implementing this system into clinical care is expected to reduce the time to surgery by 45%, which would prevent one epilepsy-related death for every 58 patients who receive surgery.",Machine Learning Approach to Identify Candidates for Epilepsy Surgery,10224663,F31NS115447,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Antiepileptic Agents ', ' Anti-epileptic ', ' Antiepileptic Drugs ', ' Antiepileptics ', ' anti-epileptic agents ', ' anti-epileptic drugs ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Hospitals ', ' Influentials ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Manuals ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Neurology ', ' Patients ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' ROC Curve ', ' ROC Analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic curve ', ' Savings ', ' Seizures ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Quality-Adjusted Life Years ', ' QALY ', ' Quality-Adjusted Life Expectancy ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Schedule ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Neurologist ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Visit ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' case control ', ' Refractory epilepsy ', ' drug-resistant epilepsy ', ' Intractable Epilepsy ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Text ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Output ', ' vector ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' clinical care ', ' electronic structure ', ' candidate identification ', ' Patient risk ', ' prospective test ', ' novel drug class ', ' new drug class ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' multidimensional data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' automated analysis ', ' structured data ', ' learning classifier ', ' magnetic resonance imaging/electroencephalography ', ' MRI/EEG ', ' ']",NINDS,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,F31,2021,40133,OH-01
"Identifying Patterns of Health Care Utilization among Physical Elder Abuse Victims Using Medicare Data and Legally Adjudicated Cases PROJECT SUMMARY The over-arching aim of this research is to: improve understanding of the patterns of health care utilization and associated costs of physical elder abuse victims to improve early identification and intervention and to inform policy. In our prior research, supported by an NIA GEMSSTAR and Beeson grant to PI Dr. Rosen, we leveraged unique partnerships with prosecutors’ offices to comprehensively examine legal case files from more than 200 victims in two large metropolitan areas, representing the largest retrospective series of legally adjudicated physical elder abuse cases ever examined. For the proposed study, we plan to link these cases, for which we have done extensive clinical analysis, to Medicare claims data. The Specific Aims of this proposal are: (1) To use Medicare claims to describe rates and patterns of health care utilization of victims before and after detection, with a focus on potentially missed opportunities by health professionals to identify abuse and differences based on victim characteristics, (2) To compare rates and patterns of ED visits and hospitalizations of physical elder abuse victims to control groups selected algorithmically from Medicare claims data, and (3) To compare patterns of health care utilization other than EDs/hospitals between victims and controls. The proposed research will provide important insight into the patterns of health care utilization for physical elder abuse victims, focusing on whether missed opportunities exist and suggestive patterns emerge. We plan to employ sophisticated machine learning approaches to increase our ability to identify patterns suggestive of physical elder abuse exposure. This will inform strategies for identification and intervention by health care providers, and knowledge gleaned will support the future development of a health informatics tool to identify potential victims. Findings on associated costs will help define the scope and impact of physical elder abuse. This innovative approach leverages existing data gathered with NIA support and extrapolates from successful research approaches in child abuse and intimate partner violence while expanding on them. As no additional subjects will be prospectively enrolled as part of this research, we avoid many of the ethical concerns typical in elder mistreatment work. Our multi-disciplinary team of experts in elder abuse, child abuse and neglect, intimate partner violence, and emergency medicine as well as specialists in statistics, health economics, and computer science is uniquely able to conduct this research. Previously, we have done seminal work examining health care usage and health-related outcomes of elder abuse victims by linking adult protective services and police databases to health care data, which is highly relevant for this proposal. We also have deep experience in using Medicare claims data and machine learning for research. The long-term goal of our research is to leverage a better understanding of health care use by elder abuse victims to improve the ability of health care providers to identify, intervene, and prevent victimization and to inform policy changes to help this vulnerable population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Elder abuse can have serious health consequences, but little is known about the patterns of their health care utilization. We propose to comprehensively examine the health care utilization and associated costs from known physical elder abuse cases using Medicare claims data. Findings from this research will improve the ability of health care providers to identify, intervene, and prevent victimization and to inform policy changes to reduce costs and help this vulnerable population.",Identifying Patterns of Health Care Utilization among Physical Elder Abuse Victims Using Medicare Data and Legally Adjudicated Cases,10224085,R01AG060086,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Child Abuse ', ' Childhood Abuse ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Control Groups ', ' Elder Abuse ', ' abuse of older adults ', ' elder maltreatment ', ' elder mistreatment ', ' elderly abuse ', ' senior abuse ', ' Emergency Medicine ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Family ', ' Fracture ', ' bone fracture ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Hospital Departments ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Influentials ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity -

"Technology Improving Success of Medication-Assisted Treatment in Primary Care Project Abstract The opioid epidemic is the U.S.'s most widespread behavioral public health problem, with a higher number of deaths due to drug overdose in 2016 compared to deaths due to HIV at the peak of the AIDS epidemic. Medication assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder (OUD) is highly efficacious. However, only a fraction of persons with OUD access MAT, and treatment non-adherence and drop out is common. There is a dire need to improve systems to address these issues and to expand the use of MAT for many patients who are out of care. This R44 STTR application responds to RFA-DA-19-020, “HEAL Initiative: America's Startups and Small Businesses Build Technologies to Stop the Opioid Crisis.” It joins an outstanding scientific team at UCLA and a small business that has developed, Opioid Addiction Recovery Support (OARS) -- a software platform that by integrating with the Electronic Health Record (EHR) improves clinical management of patients by primary care providers (PCPs) treating patients with OUD using MAT. OARS platform uses a dashboard to show real-time measurement of patient achievements in recovery. It provides opportunities for patients to interact with their PCPs, allowing for better connection to and support from their PCPs. OARS platform features artificial intelligence to analyze information from the EHR and from patients to provide relapse risk assessment for patients receiving MAT for OUD, an innovation that sets OARS apart from other software solutions. The specific aim of Phase 1 of this STTR Fast Track proposal, is to modify the OARS platform for use in primary care settings by conducting interviews with PCPs (N=20) and their patients with OUD (N=40) in primary care settings to collect data on feasibility and acceptability of engaging with OARS to inform user- centered design of OARS. The specific aims of Phase 2 of this STTR Fast Track proposal are to: (1) employ a “stepped wedge” design to assess the effectiveness of OARS in improving opioid agonist treatment outcomes across 6 treatment programs (N=200 treated patients) and (2) evaluate sustainability and return on investment of OARS implementation across 6 treatment programs. A commercialization plan documents progress to date for OARS platform and presents a market plan to improve both scale-up and quality of MAT services delivered by PCPs in primary care, which is a major contribution to addressing the ongoing opioid epidemic. Project Narrative With over 72,000 overdose deaths in 2017, of which 47,600 are attributable to opioid overdose, the opioid epidemic has become North America’s most widespread behavioral public health problem. Medication assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder (OUD) is highly efficacious. The Opioid Addiction Recovery Support (OARS), comprises of a healthcare team portal connected to a patient mobile application, to provide opioid related education, promote connectedness with clinicians, and track MAT treatment progress. This STTR Fast Track proposal will conduct interviews with patients that will inform optimal design of OARS and utilize a “stepped wedge” effectiveness design to assess the effectiveness of OARS in improving opioid agonist treatment outcomes in primary care settings and evaluate sustainability and return on investment.",Technology Improving Success of Medication-Assisted Treatment in Primary Care,10223257,R42DA050398,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Americas ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Belief ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Dropout ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Epidemic ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Investments ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' North America ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Overdose ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Public Health ', ' Relapse ', ' Risk ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Businesses ', ' Medical Care Team ', ' Health Care Team ', ' Healthcare Team ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Recovery ', ' Opioid ', ' Opiates ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Opiate Dependence ', ' opioid addiction ', ' opioid dependence ', ' opioid dependent ', ' Opiate Addiction ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' empowered ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' treatment program ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Drops ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Small Business Technology Transfer Research ', ' STTR ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Abstinence ', ' user centered design ', ' iterative design ', ' implementation science ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' commercialization ', ' patient population ', ' primary care setting ', ' overdose death ', ' overdose fatalities ', ' waiver ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile device application ', ' temporal measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' opioid use disorder ', ' opiate use disorder ', ' medication-assisted treatment ', ' opioid use ', ' opiate consumption ', ' opiate drug use ', ' opiate intake ', ' opiate use ', ' opioid consumption ', ' opioid drug use ', ' opioid intake ', ' relapse risk ', ' dashboard ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' opiate crisis ', ' opioid crisis ', ' opioid overdose ', ' opiate overdose ', ' opiate related overdose ', ' opioid drug overdose ', ' opioid induced overdose ', ' opioid intoxication ', ' opioid medication overdose ', ' opioid poisoning ', ' opioid related overdose ', ' opioid toxicity ', ' opioid agonist therapy ', ' opioid agonist treatment ', ' recruit ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' treatment services ', ' Suboxone ', ' Bunavail ', ' Zubsolv ', ' buprenorphine + naloxone ', ' buprenorphine and naloxone ', ' buprenorphine with naloxone ', ' buprenorphine-naloxone ', ' buprenorphine/naloxone ', ' phase 2 testing ', ' phase 2 evaluation ', ' phase II evaluation ', ' phase II testing ', ' treatment comparison ', ' compare treatment ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' acceptability and feasibility ', ' Helping to End Addiction Long-term ', ' HEAL Initiative ', ' Helping End Addiction Long-term ', ' Helping End Addiction Longterm ', ' Helping to End Addiction Longterm ', ' gaps in access ', ' access gaps ', ' ']",NIDA,"Q2I, LLC",R42,2021,594298,NH-02
"A BRAIN Initiative Resource: The Neuroscience Multi-omic Data Archive Project Summary The Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative promotes the development and application of technologies to describe the temporal and spatial dynamics of cell types and neural circuits in the brain. The Principal Investigator, senior personnel and staff of this project have diverse expertise required to marshall data across the BRAIN Initiative consortium, including experience in data collection from multiple institutions, large-scale quality control and analysis processing capability, familiarity with NIH policy and public archive deposition strategies. To promote smooth interactions across a large research consortium, we will develop the Neuroscience Multi-Omic Archive (NeMO Archive), a data repository that is specifically focused on the storage and dissemination of omic data from the BRAIN Initiative and related brain research projects. We will utilize a federated model for data storage such that the physical location of data can be distributed between the NeMO local file system, public repositories, and a cloud-based storage system (e.g. Amazon S3). We will leverage this capability and distribute BRAIN Initiative data between our local filesystem and the cloud. The Nemo Archive will be a data resource consistent with the principles advanced by research community members who are launching resources in next generation NIH data ecosystem. These practices include FAIR Principles, documentation of APIs, data-indexing systems, workflow sharing, use of shareable software pipelines and storage on cloud-based systems. The information incorporating into the NeMO archive will, in part, enable understanding of 1) genomic regions associated with brain abnormalities and disease; 2) transcription factor binding sites and other regulatory elements; 3) transcription activity; 4) levels of cytosine modification; and 5) histone modification profiles and chromatin accessibility. It will enable users to answer diverse questions of relevance to brain research, such as identifying diagnostic candidates, predicting prognosis, selecting treatments, and testing hypotheses. It will also provide the basic knowledge to guide the development and execution of predictive and machine learning algorithms in the future.   Project Narrative The Neuroscience Multi-Omic Archive (NeMO Archive) is a data repository that is specifically focused on the storage and dissemination of omic data from the BRAIN Initiative and related brain research projects.",A BRAIN Initiative Resource: The Neuroscience Multi-omic Data Archive,10223132,R24MH114788,"['Archives ', ' Atlases ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Chromatin ', ' Communities ', ' Cytosine ', ' Data Collection ', ' Elements ', ' Future ', ' indexing ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Patients ', ' Personnel Staffing ', ' Phenotype ', ' Quality Control ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Running ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Policies ', ' Data Storage and Retrieval ', ' data retrieval ', ' data storage ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Familiarity ', ' member ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Documentation ', "" Rh (2,2'-biquinoline) complex "", ' cis-(Rh(biq)2Cl2)Cl ', ' complex R ', ' histone modification ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Institution ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' genomic region ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' Docking ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' working group ', ' work group ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' data integration ', ' Data Coordinating Center ', ' Data Coordination Center ', ' next generation ', ' Visualization software ', ' visualization tool ', ' Bioconductor ', ' brain research ', ' database structure ', ' data base structure ', ' operation ', ' cloud based ', ' data visualization ', ' BRAIN initiative ', ' Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies initiative ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' data archive ', ' data library ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' online resource ', ' internet resource ', ' on-line compendium ', ' on-line resource ', ' online compendium ', ' web resource ', ' web-based resource ', ' cloud storage ', ' cloud-based storage ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' data resource ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' analysis pipeline ', ' Data Management Resources ', ' Data Management System ', ' Multiomic Data ', ' multiple omic data ', ' data pipeline ', ' Visualization ', ' multiple data types ', ' data centers ', ' data ecosystem ', ' data sharing ecosystem ', ' public repository ', ' publicly accessible repository ', ' publicly available repository ', ' data ingestion ', ' query tools ', ' data standards ', ' data standardization ', ' data submission portal ', ' archive data ', ' archiving data ', ' archived data ', ' data repository ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' Data Store ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R24,2021,1263611,MD-07
"Clinical Predictors of weekly Rifapentine/isoniazid related adverse drug reactions during national roll-out of tuberculosis preventive therapy Project Summary The WHO approved 3 months weekly rifapentine plus isoniazid (3HP) has been found non-inferior to 6H in preventing TB reactivation and achieves higher completion rates. The National TB program in Uganda is currently transitioning from 6HP to 3HP which will be scaled up starting in Jan 2021. Rifapentine has not been widely used in Uganda outside clinical trials and therefore its safety profile in programmatic setting in adults and children is still uncertain. Accurate profiling of patients likely to experience 3HP related adverse drug reactions (ADRs) has the potential to improve TPT completion rates, and in turn improve TB control. Our proposal seeks to describe safety profiles of 3HP, completion rates and the clinical, pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenomic determinants of 3HP-related ADRs for people receiving TPT at programmatic level. This study will take place in five health facilities in Uganda in collaboration with the National TB program and the National Drug Authority. We will conduct a cohort study where 614 adults and children >2 years, who have been initiated on 3HP for TPT by the facility clinician according to standard of care will be enrolled. Participants will be both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected. Participants will be followed up monthly for evaluation for ADRs using a standardized questionnaires, clinical evaluation and laboratory tests (liver function testing). For a subset of 300 patients (150 cases who develop grade 2 and above ADRs and 150 controls who do not experience ADRs), we will conduct pharmacokinetic sampling to measure rifapentine and isoniazid concentrations and selected genotyping (for examples N-Acetyl Transferase, Cytochrome 2E1) and Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing. We will use pharmacokinetic/pharmacogenetic-pharmacodynamic models and stochastic gradient boosted machine learning together with conventional statistical methods to determine factors associated with ADRs and simple prediction rules for the identification of patients at high risk for ADR. We will also determine the effect of the ADRs on TPT completion rates. Patients will subsequently be followed up for up to 3 years and assessed for TB reactivation according to standard of care to determine the incidence of TB reactivation in patients who have received 3HP and the risk factors for this. This study will provide data on the safety of 3HP during national roll-out and provide information on who is likely to develop ADRs which can affect treatment completion and therefore may benefit from alternative regimens. Study Narrative: This project will describe the clinical, pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenomic determinants of adverse drug reactions among people receiving 3HP for TPT in Uganda. The results of this study will inform clinical decisions for identifying patients at high risk for adverse drug reactions related to 3HP in the African setting.",Clinical Predictors of weekly Rifapentine/isoniazid related adverse drug reactions during national roll-out of tuberculosis preventive therapy,10217331,R01AI160434,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Coughing ', ' Cytochromes ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Exanthema ', ' Exanthem ', ' Rash ', ' Skin Rash ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' care facilities ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Hypotension ', ' Low Blood Pressure ', ' Vascular Hypotensive Disorder ', ' Incidence ', ' Informed Consent ', ' isoniazid ', ' Isonicotinic Acid Hydrazide ', ' Laboratories ', ' Liver Function Tests ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' M tb ', ' M tuberculosis ', ' M. tb ', ' M. tuberculosis ', ' mtb ', ' Nested Case-Control Study ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacogenetics ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Safety ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Transferase ', ' Transferase Gene ', ' Tuberculosis ', ' M tuberculosis infection ', ' M. tb infection ', ' M. tuberculosis infection ', ' M.tb infection ', ' M.tuberculosis infection ', ' MTB infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection ', ' TB infection ', ' disseminated TB ', ' disseminated tuberculosis ', ' infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' tuberculosis infection ', ' tuberculous spondyloarthropathy ', ' Uganda ', ' Adverse drug effect ', ' drug-related adverse effects ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' body weight loss ', ' wt-loss ', ' World Health Organization ', ' rifapentine ', ' Measures ', ' Guidelines ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' uptake ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' neuropathic ', ' Neuropathy ', ' Country ', ' experience ', ' authority ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' antiretroviral ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' Categories ', ' Reporting ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Pharmacogenomics ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Interruption ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Immunologics ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologically ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' pharmacodynamic model ', ' reactivation from latency ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' flu ', ' high risk ', ' alternative treatment ', ' standard of care ', ' Regimen ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' liver injury ', ' Injury to Liver ', ' hepatic damage ', ' hepatic injury ', ' liver damage ', ' clinical predictors ', ' human leukocyte antigen testing ', ' HLA testing ', ' HLA typing ', ' human leukocyte antigen typing ', ' Preventive treatment ', ' Preventative treatment ', ' Preventive therapy ', ' Preventative therapy ', ' adverse drug reaction ', ' ']",NIAID,INFECTIOUS DISEASES INSTITUTE,R01,2021,138370,
"The Dynamics of Human Atrial Fibrillation Project Summary  Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major arrhythmia worldwide, causing palpitations, stroke and mortality, and affecting 2-5 million Americans. Unfortunately, therapy to eliminate AF has had limited success. In our last funding cycle, we focused on localized drivers as potential AF mechanisms. Mapping of drivers has now been validated by concurrent optical mapping of human AF, and their features and have been validated by several other methods in patients. Nevertheless, ablation results for these and other proposed mechanisms for AF outside the pulmonary veins are mixed. It is unclear if this reflects difficulties of AF mapping, or different mechanisms between patients.  The project will develop a novel mechanistic framework for AF that simplifies existing indices by building on scientific consensus that organized AF is easier to treat, and disorganized AF has worse prognosis. This concept spans many existing indices and may help to reconcile them. We have 3 specific aims: (1) To define if the impact of ablation depends on the extent of organizing surrounding the ablation site; (2) To establish candidate mechanisms for organized and disorganized AF zones in individual patients with specific profiles, using machine learning applied to known cases with and without ablation success in our large registry. This comprises detailed AF maps during ablation and after Maze surgery, clinical data and outcomes. (3) To use novel clinical tools to predict whether patients will respond to PVI, other ablation or Maze surgery based on whether targeted regions control larger atrial areas and their locations.  This study will deliver immediate translational and clinical impact, and directly enable personalized medicine for AF ablation. We use detailed clinical mapping in patients, signal processing and computer modeling to develop a novel mechanistic framework and widely applicable clinical tools. We will use tools including machine learning and statistics to classify mechanisms based upon outcomes from ablation in individual patients. We will make our data and code available online. Our team is experienced in electrophysiology, computer science, machine learning, biological physics and statistics. The proposal is thus highly feasible. The Dynamics of Human Atrial Fibrillation Narrative Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an enormous public health problem in the United States, affecting 2-5 million Americans and causing rapid heart beats, stroke, heart failure or death. In this project, the applicant will develop a novel framework to better understand human AF that builds on agreement between several concepts for the disease.

"Advancing the Quality of Cancer Care through Behavioral Economics and Implementation Science The grand challenge addressed by the Penn Implementation Science Center in Cancer Control (Penn ISC3) is to apply insights from behavioral economics to accelerate the pace at which evidence-based practices for cancer care are deployed to improve outcomes for individuals with cancer. Penn offers a unique environment in which to conduct this paradigm-shifting work, given our expertise in implementation science, behavioral economics, and innovative cancer care delivery. The complementary and multi-disciplinary expertise of the three MPIs (Bei- das, Bekelman, Schnoll), coupled with existing Penn resources, including the Penn Center for Cancer Care Innovation [PC3I], the Center for Health Incentives and Behavioral Economics [CHIBE], and the Penn Imple- mentation Science Center at the Leonard Davis Institute [PISCE@LDI], represent a unique opportunity to ad- vance the quality of cancer care. The Administrative Core, led by Drs. Beidas, Bekelman, and Schnoll, will ensure that the activities of Penn ISC3 are coordinated, synergistic, and congruent with timelines. The Implementation Laboratory, led by Drs. Bekelman and Shulman, represents a diverse ecosystem that includes five hospitals and linked clinical sites, with over 200 oncologists that serve over 15,000 unique new patients annually. Our Research Program, led by Drs. Beidas and Buttenheim, will oversee the development and testing of implementation strat- egies that target patients and clinicians within our Implementation Lab and are centered on the idea of ‘nudging’ for optimal implementation and effectiveness outcomes. The Research Program includes investigators with ex- pertise in implementation science, behavioral economics, cancer care delivery research, healthcare innovation, measurement, and mixed methods. In the first two years, we propose three Signature Pilot Projects and two Methods Projects with a commitment to rapid learning that will allow Penn ISC3 to be optimally nimble. Signature Pilot Project 1 (Jenssen/Leone) tests patient- and clinician-directed implementation strategies to increase referral to tobacco cessation programs among cancer patients. Signature Pilot Project 2 (Bekelman/Patel) tests patient- and clinician-directed implementation strategies to increase higher-value bone modifying agents in patients with breast, lung, and prostate cancer. Common methods and measures are linked to allow for pooling of data and to accomplish our objectives of testing multilevel implementation strategies and mechanisms across contexts. Our exploratory and high-reward Signature Pilot Project 3 (Bekelman/Rendle) will test a patient-directed imple- mentation strategy that leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to promote oral chemotherapy ad- herence and symptom management. Two methods projects, in support of the Projects, will advance the science of implementation methods. Methods Project 1 will develop a toolkit for the application of rapid cycle approaches (Asch/Buttenheim); Methods Project 2 will use qualitative comparative analysis to characterize multilevel con- textual variation (Barg/Rendle). The Penn ISC3 has the potential to identify novel, disseminable, and scalable ways to advance the quality of cancer care and improve the health outcomes for individuals with cancer. PHS 398/2590 (Rev. 06/09) Page Continuation Format Page PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of the proposed Penn Implementation Science Center in Cancer Control (Penn ISC3) is to advance the science and practice of implementing evidence-based practices for individuals with cancer. The creation of the Penn ISC3 will leverage the deep expertise and resources at the University of Pennsylvania in implementation science, behavioral economics, and cancer care delivery research to address strategic priorities emphasized in the National Cancer Institute Moonshot Blue Ribbon Panel. Specifically, our focus and grand challenge theme is to test implementation strategies informed by behavioral economics to improve uptake of evidence-based practices within our Implementation Laboratory, Penn Medicine, including those from traditionally underserved populations, to improve the lives of individuals with cancer. Penn ISC3 will produce new knowledge with the potential to reduce the research-to-practice gap in cancer care and improve outcomes for millions of Americans.

"EHR-based vs population-based CVD risk predictions for older patients with diabetes Our application entitled “Fair Risk Predictions for Underrepresented Populations using Electronic Health Records” responds to NOT-OD-21-094: “Administrative Supplements to Support Collaborations to Improve the Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning [AI/ML]-Readiness of NIH-Supported Data”, and supplements our parent NIA R01 grant (R01 AG065330) entitled “EHR-based vs population-based CVD risk predictions for older patients with diabetes”. The overarching goal of the parent grant is to develop individualized absolute risk predictions of Cardiovascular diseases for older patients with diabetes using EHRs. We propose the supplement study, in parallel, to 1) investigate under-representations (bias) of racial/ethnic minorities and patients with disadvantaged Social Determinants of Health (SDOHs) in EHRs, 2) develop fairness-aware EHR prediction methods; and 3) share the simulated EHR datasets, linked SDOH datasets along with the developed fair risk prediction tools to inspire and enable the AI/ML research community for further investigations of fair EHR algorithms. During the implementation of our parent R01 project, we found emerging evidence of under- sampling bias in EHRs for racial/ethnic minorities and patients with disadvantaged SDOHs. Such patients are more likely to visit multiple institutions to receive care, and often receive fewer diagnostic tests and medications in the EHR data of a single institution. We hypothesize that racial/ethnic minorities and patients with disadvantaged SDOHs are under-represented with smaller sample sizes, insufficient diagnostics and laboratory information, and less frequent encounters in EHRs. Consequently, we hypothesize that EHR-based risk prediction models (including conventional linear models and modern AI/ML methods) ignoring the unbalanced samplings will have less-accurate predictions for these under-represented patient populations. Little or no work has been done to systematically investigate the impact of these biases. We then propose to develop fairness improvement prediction approaches for EHRs. Upon the supplement project completion, the developed fair predictions will lay the groundwork and provide resources for the broader AI/ML research community for developing fair predictions to advance disease predictions and detections for racial/ethnic minorities and patients with disadvantaged SDOHs. Project Narrative In this administrative supplement proposal, our interdisciplinary team proposes to 1) investigate under- representations (bias) of racial/ethnic minorities and patients with disadvantaged Social Determinants of Health (SDOHs) in EHRs, 2) develop fairness-aware EHR prediction methods; and 3) share the simulated EHR datasets, linked SDOH datasets along with the developed fair risk prediction tools to inspire and enable the AI/ML research community for further investigations of fair EHR algorithms.",EHR-based vs population-based CVD risk predictions for older patients with diabetes,10412553,R01AG065330,"['Algorithms ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Awareness ', ' Sampling Biases ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Censuses ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' indexing ', ' Insurance ', ' Laboratories ', ' Linear Models ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New York ', ' New York City ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' prescription procedure ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' Sample Size ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' advanced illness ', ' advanced disease ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Sampling ', ' deprivation ', ' Institution ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Outcome ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' open source ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' ethnoracial ', ' demographics ', ' parent grant ', ' parent project ', ' patient population ', ' population based ', ' social health determinants ', ' clinical risk ', ' clinical predictors ', ' learning community ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' under representation of groups ', ' under represented groups ', ' under represented populations ', ' underrepresentation of groups ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' risk prediction model ', ' social vulnerability ', ' social disadvantage ', ' social determinants ', ' sociodeterminant ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,320767,NY-12
"Stalled capillary flow: a novel mechanism for hypoperfusion in Alzheimer disease Project Summary / Abstract We seek to investigate the agent-based participation of machine learning (ML) models in an existing crowdsourcing system, which could substantially speed up biomedical image analysis without loss of data quality for Aims 2-4 in our R01 research. We encountered an analytic bottleneck in our prior R01-supported work, which seeks to reveal mechanisms that underlie capillary stalling in the brain and requires quantifying stall rates from 2PEF (2-photon excited fluorescence) image stacks. To address this, we partnered with the Human Computation Institute (HCI) to crowdsource the analysis using the online citizen science platform Stall Catchers, which has reduced the time to analyze a typical dataset from many months to just a few weeks. Beyond enabling several published results, 35,000 Stall Catchers volunteers have produced over 1.4 million high-quality “crowd” annotations, which served as a rich training set in a recent machine learning competition that led to the creation of fifty distinct ML models exhibiting a broad distribution of sensitivity and bias. None of these models, by itself, meets our stringent analytic requirements. However, if we could endow these models with sufficient agency to participate as bonafide Stall Catchers players, then we could test the hypothesis that hybrid (human/machine) ensembles will achieve the same data quality as human-only ensembles when answers are combined using our existing “wisdom of the crowd” algorithm. Developing an open source toolkit for transforming ML models into citizen science “bots” would enable a direct pathway for effectively integrating even substandard ML models into an existing crowd-powered analytic pipeline without requiring intensive re-engineering. Accelerating biomedical data analysis in this way could allow other biomedical researchers to derive immediate value from smaller training sets and investigate more hypotheses using less time and resources. This project could enable a low-overhead pathway for semi-automation using imperfect ML models, which could leverage ML sooner while reducing reliance on human cognitive resources, and provide a pathway for achieving fully automated analyses as improved ML models are added to the crowd as CitSci bots. Success in this pursuit would allow us to incorporate full-time CitSci bots into Stall Catchers, which could double the number of capillary stalling studies we can conduct in a given year toward elucidating a more complete mechanistic model of capillary stalling. This would speed up our ability to identify a targeted intervention with reduced side effects that could alleviate cognitive impairments in implicated dementias, such as Alzheimer’s disease while contributing to the advancement of hybrid intelligence methods with broad utility for biomedical data analysis. Narrative Due to an analytic bottleneck that couldn’t be solved using automation, we used citizen science to crowdsource the analysis of capillary stalling in direct support of aims in our R01-supported Alzheimer’s research. Having collected 1.4 million crowd-generated labels we recently ran a machine learning (ML) competition, resulting in 50 new ML models, which perform well but do not meet our data quality standards. We now propose to investigate a new mode of human/machine collaboration, which would allow these models to participate directly as autonomous agents alongside humans in our crowdsourcing systems, which could speed up our data analysis, reduce reliance on human annotators, and improve data quality, while providing a proof of concept and open source tools to reduce barriers and increase opportunities for using ML for biomedical data analysis.",Stalled capillary flow: a novel mechanism for hypoperfusion in Alzheimer disease,10412670,RF1AG049952,"['Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Automation ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Blood capillaries ', ' capillary ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Crowding ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Engineering ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybrids ', ' Institutes ', ' Intelligence ', ' Laboratories ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Data Compromising ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Training ', ' Blood flow ', ' Individual ', ' data quality ', ' Collaborations ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scientist ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Modeling ', ' bio-imaging ', ' biomedical imaging ', ' bioimaging ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' two-photon ', ' 2-photon ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' open source ', ' volunteer ', ' fluorescence imaging ', ' fluorescent imaging ', ' prototype ', ' hypoperfusion ', ' citizen science ', ' amateur science ', ' amateur scientists ', ' citizen scientists ', ' civic science ', ' crowd science ', ' crowd-sourced science ', ' scientific citizenship ', ' crowdsourcing ', ' crowd source ', ' crowd-sourcing ', ' crowdsource ', ' automated analysis ', ' side effect ', ' open source tool ', ' open source toolkit ', ' ']",NIA,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,RF1,2021,220000,NY-23
"Abramson Cancer Center Support Grant PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Colorectal cancer is the 4th most common cancer diagnosed and the 2nd most common cause of cancer death in the United States. The age-adjusted incidence of CRC in Philadelphia County – a persistently high poverty area– is nearly 25% above the national average. Guideline-based screening for CRC via colonoscopy or fecal immunohistochemistry (FIT) reduces CRC-associated mortality. Despite the proven benefit of regular colonoscopy, CRC screening completion rates remain only around 50% in Philadelphia County and are consistently 10-15% lower for African-Americans than White individuals living in Philadelphia County. Adverse social determinants of health such as high poverty contribute to CRC screening nonadherence disproportionately for African-American and other minority communities. Recognizing this, in 2011, Penn Medicine created a navigation program to increase access to screening colonoscopies for patients in underserved areas of West, South, and Southwest Philadelphia by providing services that reduce barriers to cancer screening, including transportation assistance and detailed instructions on bowel prep. Despite initial success in increasing colonoscopies, a key challenge in scaling this navigation program is identifying patient populations at increased risk of CRC, who may benefit most from timely navigation. Automated machine learning (ML) algorithms based on routine electronic health record (EHR) data accurately estimate a patient’s relative risk of CRC. High-risk individuals may be particularly motivated to comply with disease screening recommendations and be targeted with an effective but resource-constrained navigator program. The overarching goals of this Administrative Supplement is to support the Abramson Cancer Center (ACC) mission to increase colorectal cancer (CRC) screening completion among high-risk individuals living in a persistent poverty county by designing, conducting, disseminating and evaluating an electronic health record- based automated identification program to target effective, culturally-sensitive CRC screening navigation to individuals who have not completed an ordered colonoscopy or fecal immunochemical test (FIT). Specifically, the goals of this supplement are to: 1) Adapt a previously validated EHR-based machine learning algorithm to predict CRC detection by retraining the model using data from patients seen in primary care clinics serving zip codes with a high proportion of racial and ethnic minorities living in Philadelphia County, a persistent poverty county; and 2) Implement and evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of an algorithm-based CRC navigation program to increase colorectal cancer screening among 344 patients seen at one of 7 primary care practices within Philadelphia county who are at high risk of CRC, have uncompleted colonoscopies. Together, these projects aim to increase evidence-based screening in order to reduce the burden of CRC among high-risk individuals living in a persistent poverty county by utilizing evidence-based, targeted, culturally-sensitive CRC screening navigation that in part addresses social factors that prevent colorectal cancer screening. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because we aim to target an effective colorectal cancer screening initiative towards patients at risk for colorectal cancer who live in areas with persistent poverty, thus increasing guideline-based colorectal cancer screening for a high-risk population through targeted interventions to address social and clinical barriers to screening completion. This research proposal will optimize an automated machine learning algorithm to predict colorectal cancer risk using electronic health record data and an evidence-based navigation program to address poor colorectal cancer screening rates and increase access to screening colonoscopies for patients in underserved areas of West, South, and Southwest Philadelphia by providing services including transportation assistance, detailed instructions on bowel preparation, or mailed fecal immunochemistry tests. The project is relevant to the NCI’s mission by generating fundamental knowledge to inform clinicians, researchers, and policymakers about effective methods to utilize automated electronic health record interventions to increase the frequency and yield of guideline-based cancer screening in order to improve cancer associated outcomes among communities with high and persistent poverty.",Abramson Cancer Center Support Grant,10408409,P30CA016520,"['adenoma ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Family Practice ', ' family medicine ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Immunochemistry ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Internal Medicine ', ' Intestines ', ' Intestinal ', ' bowel ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Poverty ', ' Impoverished ', ' Poverty Areas ', ' Impoverished Areas ', ' Impoverished Regions ', ' Poverty Regions ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Program Effectiveness ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' County ', ' African American ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' Hispanics ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Relative Risks ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' CRC screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' detect colo-rectal cancer ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer prevention ', ' CRC prevention ', ' colo-rectal cancer prevention ', ' prevent colo-rectal cancer ', ' prevent colorectal cancer ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Clinic ', ' Services ', ' cancer risk ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Colo-rectal Adenoma ', ' Colo-rectal Adenomatous Polyp ', ' Colorectal Adenomatous Polyp ', ' Large Bowel Adenoma ', ' Large Bowel Adenomatous Polyp ', ' Large Intestine Adenoma ', ' Colorectal Adenoma ', ' Address ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Center Support Grant ', ' CCSG ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Instruction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' community living ', ' Outcome ', ' Consumption ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' usability ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' social health determinants ', ' screening ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial minority ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' Retrospective cohort ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' minority communities ', ' colorectal cancer risk ', ' colo-rectal cancer risk ', ' colon cancer screening ', ' colon cancer detection ', ' detect colon cancer ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' adherence rate ', ' screening guidelines ', ' recommended screening ', ' screening recommendations ', ' social factors ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' underserved area ', ' under served area ', ' under served geographic area ', ' under served location ', ' under served region ', ' underserved geographic area ', ' underserved location ', ' underserved region ', ' feasibility testing ', ' transportation access ', ' access to transportation ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,P30,2021,200000,PA-03
"AICORE-kids: Artificial Intelligence COVID-19 Risk AssEssment for kids This work is directed at characterizing pediatric COVID-19 and stratifying incoming patients by projected (future) disease severity. Such stratification has several implications: immediately improving treatment planning, and as disease mechanistic pathways are uncovered, directing treatment. Predicting future severity will inform the risks of outpatient treatment; to the patients themselves, their family, other caregivers/cohabitants, and to schools and employers. As varying levels of “reopening” are adopted across the country (and the world), such prognostication will inform policy on the handling of pediatric carriers in the community. Based on our preliminary analysis we assert that a combination of novel assays including quantitative serology inflammatory markers (cytokine/chemokine profiles, immune profiles), transcriptomics, epigenomics, longitudinal physiological monitoring, time series analysis, imaging, radiomics and clinical observation including social determinants of health, contains adequate information even at early stages of infection to stratify the disease and predict disease severity. We propose an artificial intelligence/machine learning approach to integrate this rich and heterogeneous dataset, characterize the spectrum of disease and identify biosignatures that predict severity in progressive disease. To facilitate translation of the approaches developed in this work to a wide user community, we incorporate a Translational Development function, to oversee the design-control process and ensure readiness of our methods for regulatory review. Incorporated into our timelines are appropriate regulatory milestones intended to conform with the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) programs in effect for SARS- CoV-2 diagnostics.

"Human-AI Collaborations to Improve Accuracy and Mitigate Bias in Acute Dyspnea Diagnosis PROJECT SUMMARY Acute dyspnea (shortness of breath) is one of the most common reasons for emergency department visits and hospitalizations each year. Heart failure, pneumonia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are the most common etiologies, representing 2.5 million hospitalizations in the US in 2017. Determining the precise cause of acute dyspnea is critically important but challenging, as presenting symptoms, laboratory testing, and imaging results may be difficult to interpret, particularly in the elderly and patients with comorbid disease or severe illness. Diagnostic errors and inappropriate treatment may occur in up to 30% of patients, which is associated with worse patient outcomes. Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools have been proposed to augment providers in the diagnostic process and are well-positioned to support the diagnostic evaluation of acute dyspnea. However, inaccurate AI tools can also worsen clinician performance. Therefore, simply keeping clinicians “in-the-loop” is not a guaranteed back-stop against a poorly performing model. This proposal seeks to enable effective Clinician-AI collaborations to improve diagnostic accuracy in acute dyspnea. We propose to: 1) evaluate computational strategies to improve the robustness of an AI tool used to support clinicians in the diagnosis of acute dyspnea, 2) test strategies to enhance collaborations between clinicians and AI tools, 3) prospectively evaluate an acute dyspnea AI tool in a clinical environment while evaluating strategies to collect clinician feedback to enable ongoing model improvement. Our multidisciplinary team consisting of experts in clinical medicine, computer vision, machine learning, and human-computer interaction are well positioned to tackle these important challenges. Successful completion of this proposal will result in a robust, generalizable acute dyspnea AI tool to augment physicians in the diagnostic evaluation of acute dyspnea. More broadly, the proposal will lead to generalizable knowledge to support safer development and integration of AI tools across healthcare settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE Accurate diagnosis is critical for patients hospitalized with acute dyspnea (shortness of breath), since depending on the cause (e.g., pneumonia versus congestive heart failure) treatment may vary. Artificial intelligence (AI) tools can be trained to analyze clinical and imaging data to determine the diagnosis but are susceptible to bias that results in poor generalization performance. Creating an environment where clinicians collaborate with AI to solve clinical challenges may realize the promise of AI in improving patient care.",Human-AI Collaborations to Improve Accuracy and Mitigate Bias in Acute Dyspnea Diagnosis,10272748,R01HL158626,"['Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic Errors ', ' diagnosis errors ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dyspnea ', ' Breathlessness ', ' Environment ', ' Controlled Environment ', ' artificial environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Female ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Congestive Heart Failure ', ' Cardiac Failure Congestive ', ' Heart Decompensation ', ' chronic heart failure ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybrids ', ' Intelligence ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease ', ' COPD ', ' Chronic Obstruction Pulmonary Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ', ' male ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Minority People ', ' Minority Population ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Pneumonia ', ' Testing ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' computer human interaction ', ' man-machine interaction ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Trust ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Blind Spots ', ' Retinal blind spot ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Shortness of Breath ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' Performance ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Provider ', ' Institution ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Clinical/Radiologic ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' multitask ', ' multi-task ', ' patient population ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' prospective test ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' clinical decision support ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,705334,MI-12
"Addressing racial disparities in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and progression to multiple myeloma from a prevention perspective PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Multiple myeloma (MM) is a lethal neoplasm and a common hematologic malignancy. MM is uniformly preceded by monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Unlike MM, patients with MGUS are asymptomatic. The current management for MGUS is watchful waiting for disease progression. A marked racial disparity in this disease area is long-established with a 2 to 3-fold increased risk in African Americans (AAs) compared to Caucasians. Moreover, obesity is a risk factor for MM independent of race. Obesity is prevalent in U.S. adults, and particularly more prevalent among AAs than Caucasians. As a result, without any intervention, racial disparities in this disease will continue to worsen. Metformin, a widely-used, safe, well- tolerated, and inexpensive medication, induces weight loss and has been found to be more effective in glycemic control in AAs compared to Caucasians. It has also been used in prospective trials for non-diabetes indications and solid tumor malignancies. We therefore hypothesize that metformin use in MGUS patients will prevent MM and reduce MM disparities. This project plans to focus on the precursor condition of MM – MGUS. The findings from the proposed project will inform biological mechanism studies and MGUS/MM prevention trials. The long-term goal is to identify intervention strategies to prevent the progression of MGUS to MM, reduce the overall burden of MM, and reduce MM disparities. We plan to identify whether high body mass index (BMI) and/or significant change in BMI over the life course are risk factors for MGUS by race (Aim 1), utilizing linked databases with nearly lifelong follow-up of BMI and other health measures ,as well as utilizing artificial intelligence, i.e., machine learning approaches, to perform big data analyses. We will then assess racial differences in the M-protein trajectory after MGUS diagnosis in metformin versus non-metformin users in a subgroup of MGUS patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (Aim 2.1) and the association of metformin use with the progression of MGUS to MM (Aim 2.2). Last, we will assess racial differences in the M-protein trajectory in the subgroup of MGUS patients without diabetes mellitus (Aim 3). This project is significant in its capability to 1) identify perhaps the only modifiable risk factor (high BMI) to inform interventions to prevent MM; 2) identify a dynamic marker for disease progression by race (M-protein concentration), where these biomarkers can be a surrogate for MM diagnosis in future prevention trials; and 3) reduce MM health disparities by a) identifying race-specific biomarkers for MGUS and MGUS progression, available through clinical encounters (as opposed to expensive genetic testing); and b) exploring metformin use as a chemopreventive measure. It is innovative in its 1) focus on MM prevention rather than treatment and 2) utilization of artificial intelligence to analyze big data. Successful completion of this study will provide evidence for a paradigm shift in current clinical practice of MGUS management and help prevent MM, an incurable and costly disease. More importantly, it will provide evidence to guide interventions to reduce MM disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE RELEVANCE: Racial disparities in multiple myeloma (MM), a common and incurable malignancy whose management is extremely costly, are long-established. Although MM is preceded by monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) by many years, no established prevention strategies exist and current clinical practice does not treat patients with MGUS; thus, racial disparities for this disease are expected to persist or even worsen due to the disproportionate burden of obesity – a known risk factor for MM – in the African American population. This project plans to study racial differences in risk factors/biomarkers for MGUS and the progression of MGUS to MM to inform future biological mechanism studies and MGUS/MM prevention trials with the goal of reducing MM health disparities.",Addressing racial disparities in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and progression to multiple myeloma from a prevention perspective,10271266,R01CA253475,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Metformin ', ' Dimethylguanylguanidine ', ' N,N-dimethyl-imidodicarbonimidic diamide ', ' Dimethylbiguanidine ', ' Multiple Myeloma ', ' Plasma-Cell Myeloma ', ' myeloma ', ' myelomatosis ', ' Neoplasms ', ' neoplasia ', ' neoplastic growth ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Veterans ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' body weight loss ', ' wt-loss ', ' Caucasians ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Occidental ', ' white race ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' Cost of Illness ', ' Disease Costs ', ' Sickness Cost ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Individual ', ' diabetic ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance ', ' MGUS ', ' Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance ', ' Monoclonal Gammopathy of Unknown Significance ', ' Solid Neoplasm ', ' Solid Tumor ', ' Chemoprevention ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Hematologic Cancer ', ' Hematologic Malignancies ', ' Hematological Malignancies ', ' Hematological Neoplasms ', ' Hematological Tumor ', ' Hematopoietic Cancer ', ' Malignant Hematologic Neoplasm ', ' Hematologic Neoplasms ', ' Life ', ' Event ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' Orphan Disease ', ' Rare Disorder ', ' orphan disorder ', ' Rare Diseases ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Prevention ', ' M protein ', ' multiple myeloma M Protein ', ' Watchful Waiting ', ' Patient observation ', ' carcinogenicity ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' BMI ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Department of Defense ', ' Disease Marker ', ' Economic Burden ', ' IARC ', ' International Agency for Research on Cancer ', ' precancerous ', ' premalignant ', ' Subgroup ', ' Chemopreventive Agent ', ' Chemopreventive ', ' anti-carcinogenic ', ' anticarcinogenic ', ' chemoprevention agent ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' preclinical study ', ' pre-clinical study ', ' working group ', ' work group ', ' cost ', ' health economics ', ' glycemic control ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' modifiable risk ', ' malleable risk ', ' progression marker ', ' progression biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' clinical practice ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' Prevention trial ', ' racial disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' specific biomarkers ', ' genetic testing ', ' gene testing ', ' gene-based testing ', ' clinical encounter ', ' obese person ', ' obese individuals ', ' obese people ', ' obese population ', ' obese subjects ', ' high body mass index ', ' high BMI ', ' disease disparity ', ' ']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,360281,MO-01
"Mobile Diagnosis of Congenital Genetic Conditions: A Model for Screening and Surveillance in Low-Resource Settings SUMMARY Congenital anomalies represent an increasing burden of disease worldwide, accounting for millions of birth defect-related disabilities with a disproportionate impact on Low to Middle Income Countries (LIMCs). Many harbor genetic etiologies, for which no confirmatory diagnosis can be made due to the dearth of diagnostic technologies in most LMICs. The inability to rapidly and accurately diagnose individuals that harbor a genetic syndrome increases the risk of mortality and morbidity (as a number of manageable congenital anomalies may be hidden, such as congenital heart defects or hearing infections) and prevents the accurate determination of prevalence rates, critical for public health surveillance and intervention programs. The first part (R21) of this project addresses these gaps using two synergistic mobile health intervention tools to screen for syndromic conditions and specifically demonstrate that a specific diagnostic of Down syndrome (expandable to all aneuploidies and those diseases resulting from copy number variants, point mutations and insertions/deletions) can be performed with minimal resources, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Aim 1 will be to train and validate AI-guided smartphone-based technology to screen for syndromic conditions, while Aim 2 will create low-cost, rapid initial genetic diagnostic capacity in the DRC. In the expansion part of the proposal (R33), we will test whether the implementation of a registry measuring health outcomes can be used as a scalable model for future newborn screening and health surveillance in a low-resource setting. To this effect, Aim 3 will build infrastructure for birth defects detection, genetic confirmation, competence building, and practice and outcomes surveillance in low-resource conditions with two parallel sub-aims: Aim 3a will assess the feasibility of the diagnostic capacity on a large population sample and provide a tool to measure specific health outcomes, while Aim 3b will establish a small-scale and functional database/registry of morphological, genetic, and health outcomes data. In limited resources settings, comprehensive systems to detect, refer, treat and surveil individuals with congenital anomalies are non-existent. Our innovative technologies will address this gap, build local capacity of diagnostic screening and of a data registry, allowing for early diagnosis and condition-specific care, likely to lower morbidity and mortality of children with non-communicable syndromic conditions. Millions of individuals in Low-to-Middle-Income Countries are affected by birth defects, representing a major global Public Health burden. We propose innovative low-cost strategies for reducing the impact of birth defects, based on mobile, facial recognition software to screen for dysmorphic syndromes (including Down syndrome), coupled with practical genetic solutions for early diagnosis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Our partnership between Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale, a DRC national research institute, and Children's National Hospital in Washington, DC, will create the infrastructure of a birth defect Registry, allowing for future surveillance and intervention programs in low resource settings.",Mobile Diagnosis of Congenital Genetic Conditions: A Model for Screening and Surveillance in Low-Resource Settings,10267068,R21HD102988,"['Congenital Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Malformation ', ' Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Aneuploidy ', ' Aneuploid ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Birth Rate ', ' Cheek structure ', ' Bucca ', ' Cheek ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Child Mortality ', ' Computers ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Down Syndrome ', "" Down's Syndrome "", ' Downs Syndrome ', ' Langdon Down syndrome ', ' Mongolism ', ' Trisomy 21 ', ' chromosome 21 trisomy syndrome ', ' congenital acromicria syndrome ', ' morbus Down ', ' pseudohypertrophic progressive muscular dystrophy ', ' trisomy 21 syndrome ', ' Environment ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Family ', ' Fellowship ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Hearing ', ' Congenital Heart Defects ', ' Congenital Cardiac Defects ', ' congenital cardiac anomalies ', ' Hospitals ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Newborns ', ' newborn child ', ' newborn children ', ' Infection ', ' Laboratories ', ' Materials Testing ', ' Morbidity -

LC4S will task-shift basic supervision tasks to an existing machine learning tool that analyzes and codes therapy recordings for fidelity (Lyssn; lyssn.io; Tanana et al., 2019). These data will be automatically integrated into an established HIPAA-compliant online clinical dashboard that produces performance reports for therapists and supervisors (Care4; www.care4soft.net). Care4 also will be loaded with online facilitation resources for therapists, while supervisors will be trained to lead weekly in-person supervision sessions according to best practices in measurement-based care (Martino et al., 2016; Schoenwald et al., 2009; Webster-Stratton et al., 2014). This trial will be conducted in three community mental health agencies (Psych Solutions, Inc, Behavioral Aid Solutions, Jewish Community Services) in Miami-Dade County, FL that serve low income ethnic/racial minority youth and previously partnered with the research team in R01 MH106587. In Y01 of the project, we will conduct a stakeholder-focused development process for the LC4S intervention that begins with a thorough capacity and needs assessment using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR; Damschroder et al., 2009) and is guided by the Knowledge to Action (K2A) Implementation Science Framework (Graham et al., 2006). In this phase, we will hold monthly videoconference meetings between development teams at each agency, Care4, and the investigative team to iterate the final Care4 interface with an emphasis user-centered design. In year 1, we also will conduct a small open trial to obtain user feedback (12 cases, 3 supervisors, and 6 therapists) on LC4S and we will make final adaptations to the technology and protocol. In year 2, we will conduct a pilot Hybrid Type 3 Implementation- Effectiveness randomized controlled trial (Curran et al., 2012; N=72 youth; 24 youth, 8 therapists, and 2 supervisors per agency) that will randomly assign both therapists and youth to the LC4S condition or enhanced supervision as usual (ESAU). Both supervision conditions will be delivered by endogenous, agency supervisors who are trained in delivery of the EBT and the core elements of its supervision and have access to monthly phone consultation from experts. The proximal target in this R34 pilot RCT is session by session fidelity scores. The distal service delivery outcomes in this trial are: (1) quality of EBT implementation, (2) quantity of EBT delivered in standard intervention time frame, and (3) speed of delivery (i.e., number of sessions and days to EBT completion) for each case. In support of a future R01 that measures the impact of LC4S on patient outcomes across multiple EBTs, this R34 will also focus on developing and validating appropriate study measures, testing for contamination across conditions, and establishing the costs of the LC4S intervention versus ESAU. Project Narrative Evidence-based behavior therapy for ADHD demonstrates a decrement in fidelity and effectiveness when moving from university to community settings, largely due to limited resources in poor communities (Sibley, Graziano, Coxe, Bickman, & Martin, 2020). As a result, access to quality mental health care suffers among minority, socio-economically disadvantaged adolescents who commonly seek care in these settings and are at risk for the worst clinical outcomes (Sibley, Coxe, Stein, & Meinzer, 2020). Artificial Intelligence (AI) and web-based technology can be used to automate and task-shift key supervision and training tasks (i.e., fidelity monitoring and feedback, booster trainings) thus improving fidelity and effectiveness while reducing costs associated with burdensome measurement-based supervision protocols (Tanana et al., 2019).",Community-Based Care for Minority Adolescents with

"Noninvasive bladder cancer diagnostics via machine learning analysis of nanoscale surface images of epithelial cells extracted from voided urine samples PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Bladder cancer is common cancer with an estimated 81,190 new cases and 17,240 deaths in 2018 (with > 500,000 survivors) only in the US. The gold standard for diagnosis of bladder cancer includes an invasive optical bladder examination (cystoscopy) and tumor resection for pathology examination. Because of a high recurrence rate of this cancer (50-80%), frequent (once every 3-6-12 months) costly and invasive cystoscopy exams are required to monitor patients for recurrence and/or progression to a more advanced stage. It makes bladder cancer the most expensive cancer to monitor/follow up and treat per patient. Moreover, the invasive nature of the current standard of care, cystoscopy, causes rather low compliance of patient to follow this procedure. There is an urgent unmet need for a bladder cancer screening and monitoring test, which will be noninvasive, rapid, objective, reproducible, easy to perform and interpret, and highly accurate. Such a test will reduce the need in frequent cystoscopies and greatly expand the participation of patients in screening and early detection programs because it decreases the patient discomfort and post-procedural complications.  Here we propose to develop such a test for identification of the presence of bladder cancer and its aggressiveness (grade). It will be based on non-invasive analysis of individual cells extracted from urine (extraction technology already exists in hospitals for voided urine cytology tests, (VUC) the current standard-of- care, a non-invasive examination of cells in urine used to assist with cancer diagnosis and surveillance). A novel modality of Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) will be used for nanoscale imaging of cells extracted from urine, mapping/imaging of the physical properties of the cell surface. The collected images will further be analyzed using machine-learning methods and novel advanced statistical approaches to identify a “digital signature” of cancer. The proposed technology is fundamentally different from previously studied urine biomarkers and all existing physical methods because it is based on the analysis of physical properties of the cell surface, not cell bulk or presence of biochemical markers or genetic analysis.  Our strong preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, its presumed superiority compared to the currently used non-invasive methods, and lead us to the central hypothesis that bladder cancer can be identified by analyzing a small number of cells randomly chosen from urine samples, with a low sampling error. This is a substantial departure from VUC tests, which require a visual analysis of many cells. Supported by the preliminary data, we propose (1) to optimize and expand the method, (2) to define the accuracy of cancer detection on a large cohort of patients, and (3) to assess the accuracy of identification of aggressiveness (low versus high grade) of bladder cancer.  Our long-term goal is to develop a non-invasive clinical method for accurate detecting of presence and monitoring bladder cancer as well as many other cancers, in which cells can be extracted from easily accessible bodily fluids without the need for tissue biopsy (e.g urine-bladder & upper urinary tract cancer, stool- colorectal cancer, sputum-aerodigestive cancer, cervical smears-cervical cancer etc.), using methods based on the analysis of physical characteristics of the cell surface. The proposed research, which is the first step in pursuit of this overarching goal. NARRATIVE The goal of this proposal is to develop a novel, noninvasive, and sensitive bladder cancer screening test using cells found in voided urine samples that are imaged with ultra-high-resolution atomic force microscopy. The proposed method will improve the current standard-of-care cytological evaluation of voided urine test (VUC) to detect bladder cancer with higher accuracy, and further help to identify the grade of cancer. We anticipate this innovative technology will remarkably improve patient participation for screening and follow-up on bladder cancer, and confidently nominate patients for the more invasive and expensive detection using cystoscopies.",Noninvasive bladder cancer diagnostics via machine learning analysis of nanoscale surface images of epithelial cells extracted from voided urine samples,10276838,R01CA262147,"['Adhesions ', ' Biopsy ', ' Bladder ', ' Bladder Urinary System ', ' urinary bladder ', ' Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder ', ' Bladder Cancer ', ' Malignant Bladder Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Bladder ', ' Urinary Bladder Cancer ', ' Urinary Bladder Malignant Tumor ', ' Body Fluids ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Extracts ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Control Groups ', ' Cystoscopy ', ' Cytology ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dysuria ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Feces ', ' stool ', ' Biochemical Genetics ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Hematuria ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitals ', ' Infection ', ' Judgment ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Medical Oncology ', ' Methods ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Pathology ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patient Participation ', ' Patients ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' ROC Curve ', ' ROC Analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic curve ', ' Sampling Errors ', ' Sputum ', ' Surface Properties ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urology ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Surface ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Biochemical Markers ', ' Survivors ', ' Evaluation ', ' Urothelium ', ' Burning Pain ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Atomic Force Microscopy ', ' Force Microscopy ', ' Scanning Force Microscopy ', ' Collaborations ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' innovative technologies ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' physical property ', ' viscoelasticity ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' Cell surface ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Malignant Urinary Tract Neoplasm ', ' Urinary Tract Cancer ', ' Urological Cancer ', ' Urologic Cancer ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' cell fixation ', ' diagnosis standard ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' patient cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' treatment compliance ', ' compliance behavior ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Cancer Diagnostics ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Collection ', ' Monitor ', ' Preparation ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' sample fixation ', ' Fixation ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' cellular imaging ', ' cell imaging ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' nanoscale ', ' nano meter scale ', ' nano meter sized ', ' nano scale ', ' nanometer scale ', ' nanometer sized ', ' ultra high resolution ', ' tumor ', ' high risk ', ' standard of care ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' screening ', ' algorithmic methodologies ', ' algorithmic methods ', ' microscopic imaging ', ' microscope imaging ', ' microscopy imaging ', ' clinical implementation ', ' screening participation ', ' Cervical Smears ', ' Vaginal Smears ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NCI,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,R01,2021,674628,MA-07

"Guiding humans to create better labeled datasets for machine learning in biomedical research PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Machine learning (ML) has seen tremendous advances in the past decade, fueled by growth in computing and the availability of large labeled datasets. While the impact of these advances on clinical and biomedical research are potentially significant, these applications face unique challenges due to the difficulty in acquiring labels from biomedical experts. Furthermore, ML algorithms often fail to generalize across institutions or datasets due to measurement biases (e.g. MR scanners) or intrinsic demographic or biological differences between cohorts / datasets which limits their impact in biomedical science. This proposal will develop new methodology and open-source software that biomedical data scientists can use with their applications to 1. Improve data labeling by identifying the best samples for labeling that provide the most benefit for training ML algorithms; 2. Improve generalization of ML models across institutes; and 3. Perform this work on scalable cloud platforms. We will first explore how to improve upon methods known as active learning that interactively construct labeled datasets by having an algorithm select samples that address its weaknesses and present these samples to an expert for labeling. We will then investigate how these samples can be selected to improve the performance of ML algorithms across multiple institutions by learning robust patterns that are not specific to any one site. Finally, we will develop an extendable software framework that developers can integrate into their own applications to take advantage of these methods, and that can operate on cloud platforms to support scalable analysis of large datasets. This work will be developed through a combination of simulation studies using a unique repository of over 280,000 human markups of digital pathology images at multiple institutions, and also user studies of the developed software frameworks focused on applications in perinatal pathology and the human placenta. The software tools will impact a broad variety of biomedical applications beyond pathology where data labeling and multi-institutional studies remain challenging. PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Machine learning tools can help biomedical researchers to understand their data or to make predictions. Acquiring labeled examples from biomedical experts is a significant limitation in developing machine learning tools. These tools also often fail to generalize beyond the datasets used for tool development.

"Physically Realistic Virtual Surgery Physically Realistic Virtual Surgery Abstract While virtual reality (VR)-based surgical simulation technology is being developed to improve laparoscopic surgical training outside the operating room (OR), existing simulators focus mostly on technical skills (TS) of hand-eye coordination for isolated tasks and seldom on non-technical skills (NTS) associated with both cognitive skills of decision making, as well as interpersonal skills of communication, team-work and conflict resolution. To enable VR-based surgical simulators to also train for cognitive skills, in the previous grant period we successfully developed the next generation (Gen2) of laparoscopic surgical simulators that immerse the trainee in a virtual OR using a head-mounted display (HMD) system, and introduce distractions, interruptions and other stressors to capture the high-stress environment of the real OR. However, to the best of our knowledge, there exists no VR-based simulator for training interpersonal skills needed for the multidisciplinary integration of OR teams, which consist of surgeons, anesthesiologists, and perioperative nurses. Following the significant reduction of adverse events in other disciplines, such as aviation, by the introduction of mandatory simulation-based team training (e.g., crew resource management), the National Surgical Skills Curriculum developed by the American College of Surgeons (ACS) and Association of Program Directors in Surgery (APDS) has prescribed ten team-based training modules to be performed in a simulation facility (e.g., an OR endosuite) with scenario-based training on high- fidelity manikin simulators. However, such facility-based team training is extremely expensive and cumbersome, requires dedicated facility and faculty time, and entails significant planning and schedule coordination between trainees, technicians, and faculty. To overcome the challenges of facility-based OR team training, the goal of this project is to extend the immersive VR technology (Gen2) developed as part of our prior grant for a single user to the entire OR team, and harness recent advances in cloud computing, mobile device-based VR and artificial intelligence and machine learning to design, develop and evaluate a Virtual Operating Room Team Experience (VORTeX) simulation system. The VORTeX will allow the OR team to train together in a distributed fashion (i.e., not co-located in the same room or simulation facility) wearing mobile device-based HMD systems to develop further their NTS based on computer-generated simulation scenarios replacing the physical ones. Evaluation of the simulation scenarios will be performed asynchronously by a team of experts based on post-action replays. We will implement the VORTeX for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy crisis scenario, developed and validated by our Co-I Dr. Dan Jones at BIDMC and adopted as one of the team training modules of the ACS/APDS national surgical skills curriculum. We hypothesize that the VORTeX will be at least as good as or better than traditional facility-based simulation in providing non-technical skills training to OR teams. Project Narrative: The goal of this research is to develop and validate a comprehensive computer-based technology that will allow surgical trainees to practice their surgical skills on computer-based models. Surgical procedures and techniques, learnt and perfected in this risk-free manner before application to patients, will translate to fewer operating room errors, reduced patient morbidity and improved patient outcomes resulting in faster healing, shorter hospital stay and reduced post surgical complications and treatment costs.",Physically Realistic Virtual Surgery,10296166,R01EB005807,"['Adoption ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Aviation ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Boston ', ' Client ', ' Communication ', ' Computers ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Decision Making ', ' Environment ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Faculty ', ' Feedback ', ' Floor ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Israel ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Manikins ', ' Mannequins ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Operating Rooms ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Standardization ', ' Stress ', ' Perioperative Nursing ', ' OR nurse ', ' OR nursing ', ' Surgical Nursing ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Technical Expertise ', ' technical skills ', ' Schedule ', ' Treatment Cost ', ' conflict resolution ', ' Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy ', ' Celioscopic Cholecystectomy ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Surgical complication ', ' surgery complication ', ' Discipline ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures ', ' Minimal Access Surgical Procedures ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Event ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' instructor ', ' skills training ', ' Medical center ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' stressor ', ' success ', ' eye/hand coordination ', ' hand and eye coordination ', ' hand/eye coordination ', ' eye hand coordination ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' virtual reality ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Effectiveness ', ' distraction ', ' Board Certification ', ' Interruption ', ' American College of Surgeons ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' cognitive training ', ' healing ', ' virtual ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' interactive computing ', ' computer generated ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' cloud computer ', ' cognitive skill ', ' Software Framework ', ' cloud platform ', ' cloud server ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' virtual surgery ', ' Surgical Simulation ', ' virtual reality surgery ', ' virtual reality environment ', ' immersive digital environment ', ' immersive environment ', ' immersive virtual environment ', ' immersive virtual reality ', ' virtual environment ', ' head mounted display ', ' head mounted device ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' simulation environment ', ' virtual patient ', ' ']",NIBIB,RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE,R01,2021,654073,NY-20
"Mapping opioid-dependence state transitions across structural, functional, and transcriptomic topologies PROJECT SUMMARY Opioid addiction is a chronic, progressive disorder that fuels the current US epidemic of opioid overdose deaths. Over the years, a tremendous amount of research effort has been devoted to understanding the biological roles of opioid receptors and developing newer generations of synthetic opioids to treat pain and combat opioid addiction. However, given the advancement of contemporary and novel neuroscience technologies, we have the tools to think beyond mu-opioid receptors (MORs) to develop improved OUD therapeutics. This proposal aims to investigate the architecture and function of endogenous MOR-expressing neural circuits in the brain and to determine how these circuits maintain cellular dependence and drive brain-wide maladaptive plasticity across different stages of the OUD cycle. In four complementary aims, we will first map the shifting structural and functional connectivity of opioidergic networks using viral-genetic and tissue clearing methods to identify monosynaptic inputs to withdrawal-active MOR-expressing cells and axonal output projections, as a function of opioid exposure and abstinence. We will then integrate these input/output maps with cell-type information and gene expression changes within dependence networks using hyper-multiplexed 3D in situ hybridizations to generate the anatomic localization of hundreds of dependence-related genes, targeted to cell types and retro- labeled connections. Finally, to reveal how MOR-expressing cells within core regions are modulated during opioid exposure in real-time, we will use miniature head-mounted microscopes to image the population activity— at cellular resolution—across weeks of opioid exposure and withdrawal. Our models will provide formal summaries of activity, connectivity, and gene expression as they evolve with repetitive opioid exposure and withdrawal, and our datasets will be made publicly available as they are generated. To bridge these experimental measurements and provide a common framework for our analyses, we will adopt Network Control Theory to identify brain nodes that drive the transition between opioid dependence states to identify potential candidates that disproportionately drive each state. PROJECT NARRATIVE Since their discovery almost 50 years ago how opioid receptors facilitate the development of dependence and withdrawal at a circuit level is still not known. To address this question, we will chart the global cell-type identity, shifting connectivity, and ensemble activity of opioidergic networks by examining brains throughout various stages of addiction. By leveraging cutting-edge neuroscience technologies, we will map and profile neuronal ensembles and cell-types that mediate opioid action in the rodent brain.","Mapping opioid-dependence state transitions across structural, functional, and transcriptomic topologies",10293782,R01DA054374,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Atlases ', ' Axon ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemic ', ' Evolution ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Head ', ' Incidence ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' opioid withdrawal ', ' opiate withdrawal ', ' opioid detox ', ' opioid detoxification ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Opioid Receptor ', ' Opiate Receptors ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' mu opioid receptors ', ' μ opioid receptors ', ' μ-OR ', ' μOR ', ' Generations ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' In Situ Hybridization ', ' in situ Hybridization Genetics ', ' in situ Hybridization Staining Method ', ' Label ', ' Microscope ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' endogenous opioids ', ' endogenous opiate ', ' Opioid Peptide ', ' Opiate Peptides ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Opioid ', ' Opiates ', ' Measurement ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' Dependence ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Behavior-Related Disorder ', ' Behavior-Related Problem ', ' Lifestyle-Related Disorder ', ' Lifestyle-Related Problem ', ' Lifestyle-related condition ', ' Opiate Dependence ', ' opioid addiction ', ' opioid dependence ', ' opioid dependent ', ' Opiate Addiction ', ' Viral Genetics ', ' virus genetics ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' neural function ', ' Neurophysiology - biologic function ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' High Throughput Assay ', ' high throughput screening ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Genomics ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Resolution ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' next generation ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' transcriptomics ', ' Abstinence ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' neuroadaptation ', ' neural adaptation ', ' combat ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' control theory ', ' opioid use disorder ', ' opiate use disorder ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' opioid exposure ', ' opiate exposed ', ' opiate exposure ', ' opioid exposed ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' opiate crisis ', ' opioid crisis ', ' opioid mortality ', ' opiate deaths ', ' opiate mortality ', ' opioid deaths ', ' opioid overdose death ', ' opioid related death ', ' neural network ', ' synthetic opioid ', ' synthetic opiate ', ' Visualization ', ' searchable database ', ' searchable data base ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,516298,PA-03
"Risk and Resilience in Urban Black American Acute Trauma Survivors PROJECT ABSTRACT Trauma is common and increases risk for a host of negative health outcomes, most notably posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Given the potential harmful sequelae of trauma exposure, it is crucial to identify acute post-trauma risk factors that predict chronic PTSD. Moreover, urban racial/ethnic minorities can experience significant environmental stress that puts them at particularly high risk for PTSD. At this juncture relatively little data exists to aid in prediction of risk specific to urban racial minorities, or that takes into account how disadvantage and minority stress may impact neurobiological stress systems in the months following trauma, and how that affects risk for long-term distress. Thus, under the guidance of a community advisory board our team will 1) identify acute post-trauma neurobehavioral predictors of risk for chronic PTSD among urban Black Americans, with a focus on prefrontal-subcortical function during processing of threat, 2) characterize how the longitudinal interaction of socioenvironmental risk and resilience factors and biological stress markers following trauma impacts risk, and 3) use machine learning to identify the most robust set of predictors of chronic PTSD drawn from a comprehensive assessment of neuroimaging, biomarkers, self-report and geocoded risk and resilience variables. We will recruit 190 adults who identify as Black or African American from the Emergency Department at Froedtert Hospital/Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, and conduct comprehensive assessments at 2 weeks, and 3, 6, and 12 months following trauma exposure. The two-week and 12-month assessments will include measures of neural systems for threat processing, including both anticipation of and reactivity to threat. All visits will include measures of PTSD and other symptoms, neurobiological stress markers, particularly endocannabinoids, and socioenvironmental risk and resilience factors, especially those relevant for urban Black Americans. We will examine how acute post-trauma neurocircuitry variables (2 week) predict PTSD and other outcomes twelve months later, and how pre-trauma environmental variables (resource deprivation, child maltreatment, violence exposure) moderate this relationship (Aim 1). We will also assess how, in the months following trauma, socio-environmental risk and resilience factors influence neurobiological stress systems, and how this interaction impacts risk for PTSD, poor physical health, and emotion regulation neurocircuitry at twelve months (Aim 2). We will use both hypothesis-driven analyses focusing on a priori specified predictors (Aims 1 and 2), as well as comprehensive data-driven machine learning analyses (Aim 3). This approach will allow for determination of the additional utility of neurobiological markers for predicting risk beyond previously identified self-report indicators. We expect this project to lead to identification of predictors of PTSD following trauma for urban Black Americans at high risk that are linked to underlying processes (hyper-responsivity to threat, aberrant neurobiological stress response) that can inform preventive interventions, ultimately improving the quality of life for urban Black American trauma survivors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Identifying factors that contribute to risk or resilience for long-term post-traumatic distress is a pressing public health problem, particularly for urban racial minorities who are at high risk and experience significant chronic socioenvironmental stress. This work seeks to identify whether dysregulation in emotion regulation neural circuitry two weeks following trauma predicts PTSD and other post-trauma symptom twelve months later among urban Black adults. Moreover, we will examine how environmental risk (e.g., discrimination) and protective factors (e.g., neighborhood cohesino) in the months following trauma impact neurobiological stress systems and how this interplay impacts neural health and risk for chronic distress. These data will advance our understanding of both socioenvironmental and neurobiological factors associated with vulnerability to specific trauma-related pathology and provide an important step toward identifying appropriate early interventions in the wake of trauma.",Risk and Resilience in Urban Black American Acute Trauma Survivors,10379585,R01MH128982,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human

"Discovering clinical endpoints of toxicity via graph machine learning and semantic data analysis Project Summary/Abstract This project proposes the development of new methods and data resources to integrate modern artificial intelligence (AI) techniques into predictive toxicology, as well as the application of those methods and resources to generate new hypotheses linking putative toxicants to specific clinical outcomes. The recent explosion of publicly available chemical and biomedical data provides an immensely valuable resource for computational toxicologists, but existing techniques for learning from these data perform poorly and fail to capture crucial patterns that span multiple levels of biological organization. For example, the US FDA maintains a computational toxicology database cataloguing over 875 thousand chemicals of toxicologic concern, yet only a small handful of these have been characterized in terms of their downstream clinical effects. However, informatics and machine learning (ML) provide specific tools that may solve this issue. This project focuses on 2 of those in particular: Graph machine learning (Graph ML) and semantic data analysis. Since both of these techniques allow for the integration of information from multiple otherwise incongruent sources, they have the capacity to outperform simpler traditional methods for pattern discovery, while increasing both inferential capacity and statistical power.  Our central hypothesis is that inductive learning on semantic graph data provides an effective means for generating and validating translational and mechanistic conclusions from existing public toxicology data. In Aim 1 (K99), a new data infrastructure—driven by a large, ontology-controlled graph database aggregating public toxicology data—will be constructed and evaluated on several important tasks in computational toxicology. Together, these resources will be named `ComptoxAI'. Aim 2 (K99) will develop and apply a graph machine learning strategy to predict new adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) in the graph database. Importantly, this aim will use an automated machine learning (Auto ML) approach to discover optimized neural network architectures for this prediction task in a data-driven manner. This Auto ML strategy will use estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) to search for optimized network architectures in a probabilistic manner. An expected side effect of the Auto ML approach is increased model interpretability over existing applications of Graph ML. Aim 3 (R00) will use semantic data analysis via ontological inference to refine Aim 2's model outputs into meaningful knowledge, proposing specific mechanistic explanations for the newly proposed AOPs. Aim 4 (R00) will use the resources and outcomes of the previous Aims as a starting point to develop and disseminate new open-source data standards, software resources, and research reporting protocols, with the goal of creating a collaborative, cross-institutional research ecosystem for AI research in computational toxicology.  Beyond the methodological and infrastructural contributions of this work, successful completion of the Specific Aims will yield a library of mechanistically-based hypotheses linking putative toxicants to specific clinical outcomes, addressing a major need in predictive toxicology. In supporting the goals of the open science movement, all research outcomes from this project—including papers, software, data, and other resources—will be made available for free public reuse. Project Narrative A central goal of toxicology is to predict the clinical effects that can result from specific toxic exposures, especially for chemicals with incomplete or insufficient experimental data. The proposed research provides tools, methods, and real-world applications for predicting these effects computationally by adapting and extending techniques from translational bioinformatics and artificial intelligence, while addressing specific issues that have limited the success of computational toxicology in the past.",Discovering clinical endpoints of toxicity via graph machine learning and semantic data analysis,10371656,K99LM013646,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cataloging ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Explosion ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Modernization ', ' Names ', ' Paper ', ' Productivity ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Semantics ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Toxicology ', ' Work ', ' Xenobiotics ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' base ', ' environmental toxicology ', ' ecological toxicology ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Chemicals ', ' Evaluation ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Human body ', ' Human Figure ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' interest ', ' success ', ' toxicant ', ' Informatics ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Structure ', ' Graph ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' QSAR ', ' Quantitiative Structure Activity Relationship ', ' Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' small molecule ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Emerging Technologies ', ' Emergent Technologies ', ' Genetic Programming ', ' Genetic Algorithm ', ' Ontology ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Kinesiology ', ' Movement science ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Toxicant exposure ', ' toxic exposure ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' clinical effect ', ' real world application ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' network architecture ', ' clinical predictors ', ' hands-on learning ', ' applied learning ', ' interactive engagement ', ' interactive learning ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' trend analysis ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' open data ', ' open science ', ' open-source data ', ' computational toxicology ', ' data resource ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Data Scientist ', ' multimodal data ', ' multi-modal data ', ' multi-modal datasets ', ' multimodal datasets ', ' neural network architecture ', ' neural net architecture ', ' informatics tool ', ' side effect ', ' biomedical data science ', ' data infrastructure ', ' diverse data ', ' data diversity ', ' data standards ', ' data standardization ', ' knowledge graph ', ' graph knowledge base ', ' graph knowledgebase ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K99,2021,91530,PA-03
"Stakeholder Guidance to Anticipate and Address Ethical Challenges in Applications of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Algorithmic Medicine: a Novel Empirical Approach PROJECT ABSTRACT The potential for artificial intelligence applications to enable more granular and pervasive measurement, prediction, and provide behavioral interventions offers immense promise in reaching the goal of precision health to maintain the overall health of populations. When applied to devices encountered in our everyday environment, (e.g. personal computers, mobile phones, computer mice, even office furniture such as sit-stand desks), machine learning algorithms can amplify the impact of technology on health improvement by its ability to passively sense stress, and to provide just-in-time behavioral interventions based on contextual data and self-reported user feedback. At the same time, the ethical dimensions of these innovative lines of work – some of which entail fundamental concerns about privacy and autonomy – require careful attention from the scientific community. Most critically, there has been little engagement with the end-users of such technologies as a major stakeholder group who are most affected by these learning systems and tools. This administrative supplement request is premised on the fact that the rationale for and unmet needs targeted in the scope and aims of the parent grant can be even more effectively met (i.e. not changed but enriched) by adding participants with direct exposure and personal experience of interacting with precision health technologies to the last stakeholder group in the parent grant (i.e. patients). By extending the patient group in Aim 1 to include those directly participating in cutting-edge research at the intersection of occupational and precision health research, the Aims and Scope of the parent grant remain unchanged, while the real-world application and impact of the products from the parent grant are substantially enhanced. Our Supplemental proposal incorporates precision health technologies involving behavioral interventions of stress management that use ML into the first Specific Aims of the parent R01. In Supplemental Aim 1, we will use semi-structured interviews and qualitative methods to articulate ethical issues in the context of the development, refinement, and application of machine learning in behavioral interventions as part of a precision health methodology, with particular attention to occupational health contexts. Specifically, our methodology elicits a wide range of viewpoints from participants by comparing two distinct types of machine learning applications (i.e. physical versus digital interventions), with two varying degrees of autonomy that users may exercise to accept or reject the AI-recommended interventions. Both of these applications present novel ethical questions regarding the decision-making role of ML/AI algorithms in behavioral health research and practice. This supplementary project leverages access to the exceptional machine learning research conducted at Stanford University, including work by NIH-funded investigators, and provides extensive, systematically collected data on ethical issues encountered and anticipated as a result of machine learning applications in precision, behavioral, and occupational health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Machine learning-based and AI-driven precision behavioral health now faces an urgent need to anticipate and address emerging ethical issues. The failure to examine ethical issues from the perspective of end-users as a major stakeholder group will inevitably limit the ecological validity and utility of the algorithms and threaten society's future embrace of these innovations. An empirical approach to anticipating ethical concerns is needed to provide practitioners, machine learning researchers, policymakers, and the public with evidence to better enable ethical application and translation of algorithms in precision behavioral health.",Stakeholder Guidance to Anticipate and Address Ethical Challenges in Applications of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Algorithmic Medicine: a Novel Empirical Approach,10367404,R01TR003505,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Decision Making ', ' Environment ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Exercise ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Feedback ', ' Furniture ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Moods ', ' Morals ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Occupational Health ', ' Privacy ', ' Ethical Issues ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' stress management ', ' stress buffering ', ' Personal Computers ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Published Comment ', ' Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Dimensions ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Occupational ', ' interest ', ' innovative technologies ', ' experience ', ' authority ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' behavioral health ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' Legal ', ' Address ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Data ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Instruction ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' two-dimensional ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' real world application ', ' parent grant ', ' evidence base ', ' population health ', ' surveillance data ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' health management ', ' health care management ', ' healthcare management ', ' clinical decision support ', ' Precision Health ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' data privacy ', ' digital intervention ', ' digital health ', ' ']",NCATS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,157426,CA-18
"Estimating and Mitigating Thyroid Cancer Overdiagnosis: A Mathematical Modeling Approach PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (from R01CA251566) This proposal will generate evidence to reduce the overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer in the United States. Overdiagnosis is the identification of a disease that, had it not been detected, would be unlikely to cause symptoms or death during a patient’s lifetime. Overdiagnosis has significant consequences, such as overtreatment with associated side effects and complications, patient anxiety, and increased healthcare costs. Despite a three-fold increase in thyroid cancer diagnoses since the late 1980s, the mortality rate remains stable. Small papillary thyroid cancers, which are rarely lethal, are responsible for virtually the entire increase in incidence. However, it is not safe to assume that all small thyroid cancers are over diagnosed; some small thyroid cancers can be aggressive and do need treatment. Effective methods are urgently needed to understand the key factors contributing to thyroid cancer overdiagnosis, so that directed solutions can be developed and implemented to reduce overdiagnosis. We propose the innovative use of systems engineering and simulation modeling to address this knowledge gap and provide a nuanced understanding of the natural history of thyroid tumors. We will use our model to identify the effect of reducing referrals for and use of thyroid imaging on overdiagnosis; the effect of changing the size threshold for biopsy on overdiagnosis; and the downstream impact of reducing overdiagnosis on harms and benefits of treatment. This approach also accounts for differential use and improved precision of ultrasound over time. Our goal is to create and validate a simulation model that quantifies overdiagnosis in thyroid cancer. We will engage stakeholders at all stages of development, from model conception to validation, to elicit clinical guidance and inform our model inputs, outcomes, and dissemination strategies. Our research team comprises an industrial-systems engineer with expertise in cancer modeling, as well as experts in thyroid cancer, cancer epidemiology, health services research, and communication. The multidisciplinary team is highly qualified to complete the three specific aims: (1) Develop and validate a simulation model to quantify overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer in the US; (2) Identify healthcare utilization patterns (e.g., provider encounters and referral decisions) that expose patients to increased thyroid imaging, biopsies, and the overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer; (3) Engage key stakeholders throughout the duration of the project to ensure that the model has face validity, and that the output can be applied to questions important to both clinicians and policy makers. The proposed research aligns with the National Cancer Institute’s mission to help people live longer and healthier lives. Results from this innovative model will help to inform clinical practice guidelines and referral practice recommendations to improve the quality of health care, while reducing inappropriate testing, to minimize overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Project Narrative (from R01CA251566) Overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer is a significant problem that compromises patients' quality of life, leading to overtreatment, exposure to unnecessary risk, and high medical costs. The objective of this research is to identify factors that predispose people to being diagnosed with thyroid cancer that would never cause symptoms or death if undetected, so the healthcare system can instead focus resources on thyroid cancers that would result in morbidity if untreated. Results of the model will help to inform clinical practice guidelines and referral practice recommendations to improve the quality of health care while reducing inappropriate testing, to minimize overdiagnosis and overtreatment.",Estimating and Mitigating Thyroid Cancer Overdiagnosis: A Mathematical Modeling Approach,10307232,R01CA251566,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Biopsy ', ' Breast ', ' Calibration ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of thyroid ', ' Malignant Thyroid Gland Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Thyroid ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Thyroid Gland ', ' Thyroid Cancer ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Conceptions ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' services research ', ' Incidence ', ' Industrialization ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Nodule ', ' Patients ', ' Predisposing Factor ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Thyroid Gland ', ' Thyroid ', ' Thyroid Head and Neck ', ' thyroid neoplasm ', ' Thyroid Gland Neoplasm ', ' Thyroid Gland Tumor ', ' Thyroid Tumor ', ' Time ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' United States ', ' Quality-Adjusted Life Years ', ' QALY ', ' Quality-Adjusted Life Expectancy ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' medical costs ', ' Guidelines ', ' Natural History ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Ensure ', ' Lesion ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' Papillary thyroid carcinoma ', ' Papillary Thyroid Cancer ', ' Papillary Thyroid Gland Cancer ', ' Thyroid Gland Papillary Carcinoma ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Clinical Practice Guideline ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' colo-rectal ', ' colorectum ', ' Colorectal ', ' tumor growth ', ' novel ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' Modeling ', ' cessation of treatment ', ' treatment cessation ', ' Withholding Treatment ', ' cancer location ', ' cancer site ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' model development ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' cancer epidemiology ', ' Provider ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' Cancer Model ', ' CancerModel ', ' Non-Malignant ', ' nonmalignant ', ' Validation ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' virtual ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' virtual laboratory ', ' remote laboratory ', ' virtual lab ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' overtreatment ', ' over-treatment ', ' side effect ', ' Patient imaging ', ' unethical ', ' dissemination strategy ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2021,100507,WI-02
"A Chatbot Utilizing Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to Implement the Brief Negotiation Interview to Improve Engagement in Buprenorphine Treatment among Justice-Involved Individuals Project Summary/Abstract This Administrative Supplement proposes the participation of a 3-member team from the Center for Progressive Recovery, LLC (CPR) in the Innovation Corps (I-Corps™), an intensive, 8-week program focused on developing a successful commercialization plan and business model for technology-driven start-ups funded by NIH’s SBIR Phase I mechanism. The program would entail training, as well as structure and accountability around conducting 100 interviews with key stakeholders and others whose expertise would inform the company’s plans. The SBIR Phase I award to CPR (the small business concern, SBC) that this application is predicated on addresses the problem that the people at the greatest risk of dying from an opioid overdose are the least likely to get life-saving medication. Justice- involved individuals coming out of prison have the highest risk of death by overdose (8x greater than the general population), yet only 1 in 20 of these individuals receive buprenorphine (bup), a safe, effective medication that has been shown to reduce a person’s risk of death by overdose by half. There is an urgent need to facilitate an increase in bup treatment engagement among these individuals. Two of the top barriers to receiving bup for this population are 1) system level barriers and, 2) low levels of individual motivation. We will disrupt system level barriers by circumventing the pieces of the probation system that are stigmatizing and reduce the chances of a bup referral with an artificial intelligence (AI)-based chatbot. This will be the only tool needed to receive a referral to a bup provider. We will also address low individual motivation with the chatbot by programming it to deliver the efficacious Brief Negotiation Interview (BNI) without the need for a trained human. Our aims are: Aim 1: Design and develop a prototype chatbot to motivate bup engagement. Milestones: (a) human-centered design (HCD) interviews with key stakeholders; and (b) creation of a chatbot using machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) that is integrated with a mobile application; Aim 2: Conduct a 4-week pilot study with 60 probationers randomly assigned to the BNI Chatbot or Digital Resources (i.e., Digitally-delivered OUD and buprenorphine education and referral resources). The following 3-member team has deep expertise in developing and bringing to market digital health solutions and was formed to pursue the unique benefits of the I-Corps program. All 3 are able to meet the time-intensive requirements of the training program: 1) Michael V. Pantalon, Ph.D., CEO; 2) Marianne S. Pantalon, Ph.D., PI, and 3) Thomas Wheeler, Industry Expert and CTO. With this sophisticated program, CPR would be in a much better position to secure SBIR Phase II funding.

The specific aims of the SBIR Phase I awarded to CPR (the small business concern) that this application is predicated on are: 1) to design and develop a prototype of an AI-powered Brief Negotiation Interview Chatbot to motivate probationers (who have among the highest rates of death by opioid overdose) to engage in buprenorphine, a treatment that reduces overdoses by half, and 2) to conduct a 4-week pilot study with 60 probationers randomly assigned to the BNI Chatbot or Digital Resources.",A Chatbot Utilizing Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to Implement the Brief Negotiation Interview to Improve Engagement in Buprenorphine Treatment among Justice-Involved Individuals,10304214,R43DA051267,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Award ', ' Buprenorphine ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Industry ', ' Interview ', ' Justice ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Overdose ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Prisons ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Savings ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Accountability ', ' Businesses ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Death Rate ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' Structure ', ' member ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' probation ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' probationer ', ' Population ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' high risk ', ' overdose death ', ' overdose fatalities ', ' Secure ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile device application ', ' Innovation Corps ', ' I-Corps ', ' opioid overdose ', ' opiate overdose ', ' opiate related overdose ', ' opioid drug overdose ', ' opioid induced overdose ', ' opioid intoxication ', ' opioid medication overdose ', ' opioid poisoning ', ' opioid related overdose ', ' opioid toxicity ', ' opioid mortality ', ' opiate deaths ', ' opiate mortality ', ' opioid deaths ', ' opioid overdose death ', ' opioid related death ', ' system-level barriers ', ' buprenorphine treatment ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' chatbot ', ' chat bot ', ' digital health ', ' ']",NIDA,"CENTER FOR PROGRESSIVE RECOVERY, LLC",R43,2021,55000,CT-03
"Development of personalized ex vivo predictive technology for rapidly matching patient tumors with chemotherapy regimens before treatment. Project Summary/Abstract Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is among the deadliest cancers with <9% five-year survival rate and an estimated 60,000 deaths/year by 2030. PDAC is often diagnosed at an advanced stage thereby precluding surgical resection for most patients. While new systemic therapy regimens have improved survival, availability of multiple options, without tools to select an optimal regimen from these (on an individualized basis), has created a frustrating paradox in clinical decision-making. Due to a lack of personalized predictive tools, current standard of care treatment strategy is based on prognostic factors such as age, stage, performance status, serum albumin, etc. There is a critical, urgent and unmet need to develop predictive tools that can identify optimal systemic therapy regimens and eliminate from consideration ineffective options, on an individualized basis, to improve quality of life and reduce overtreatment. CerFlux, Inc. is developing such predictive technology with its low-cost and rapid Personalized Oncology Efficacy Test (POET) to match each patient with the right treatment – before treatment – to transform pancreatic cancer treatment in the near-term and make a difference in the lives of patients and providers around the world. Our personalized medicine approach is unique and further enhanced by a commercial-academic collaboration between CerFlux, Inc. and the James Comprehensive Cancer Center at the Ohio State University. The proposed project will build on recent work by our team including a patented (US 10,114,010B1) biomimetic in vitro platform for pharmacological transport and pancreatic microtissue tumor models. The commercial goal of this proposal is to identify best practices for using POET in personalized therapy. Our hypothesis is that response to treatment observed in POET will approximate the response in the corresponding patient. Our objective is to predict both effective and ineffective treatments for each patient prior to initiating treatment. We propose the following aims to achieve our objective: Aim 1: Calibrate and optimize POET for evaluating therapeutics using human PDAC cell-line xenografts for subsequent testing with patient tissue. Aim 2: Evaluate efficacy of various systemic therapy agents in POET on an individualized basis to establish protocols and best practices for using POET in personalized therapy. We envision substantial continuing commercial-academic collaboration between CerFlux, Inc. and the James Comprehensive Cancer Center at the Ohio State University including the integration of machine learning to derive a “POET Score” – a personalized quantitative efficacy score – based on a combination of factors. Data from POET and the POET Score will help clinical teams rank treatments for individual patients before the first drug infusion. If successful, this SBIR-driven study has the potential to transform pancreatic cancer treatment in the near-term and make a positive impact around the world.

"CRITICAL: Collaborative Resource for Intensive care Translational science, Informatics, Comprehensive Analytics, and Learning CRITICAL: Collaborative Resource for Intensive care Translational science, Informatics, Comprehensive Analytics, and Learning Translational research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been hindered by the lack of shared data resources with sufficient depth, breadth and diversity. There are very limited EHR datasets freely available to the general research community especially the AI research community through credential-based access. MIMIC dataset is from a single institution that has a fixed and limited racial, ethnic and geographic profile. The eICU dataset is limited in data comprehensiveness (e.g., number of kinds of lab tests ~1/5 of MIMIC), data span (1 year, 2014- 2015), and data variety (e.g., no free text clinical notes) etc. Thus MIMIC and eICU respectively have advantages and disadvantages of data depth and data breadth. The vision of this proposal is to leverage multiple CTSAs with diverse racial, ethnic and geographic profiles in order to develop and evaluate a multi-site de-identified ICU dataset, to facilitate accelerate translational research in AI and deep learning approaches to understand, track, and predict the pathophysiological state of patients. In this project, a group of nationwide CTSA sites will work together to build a new, more inclusive, multi-site dataset that is downloadable from NCATS cloud by researchers with credential-based access. This project will combine the respective advantages of MIMIC (data depth) and eICU (data breadth). The created dataset will include more geographic regions, larger quantities of time-series data, including pre-, during- and post- ICU patient information. This will incorporate not only more patient diversity, but also capture regional population differences and practice variations that could have clinical impact. Aim 1 will develop and provide credentialed access to a multi-site dataset consisting of de-identified discrete outpatient, inpatient, and ICU data for critically ill at respective CTSAs. Aim 2 will create federated access dataset from and develop novel federated learning methods on the part of the multi-site ICU data consisting of unstructured clinical notes or structured data for select group of patients at higher risks of re-identification (e.g., rare disease patients). Aim 3 will develop novel memory-network based meta-learning AI algorithms and use the multi-site dataset to answer concrete and long-standing clinical problems in critical care. Aim 4 will innovatively leverage the library network to develop and disseminate open resources for the research community and develop best practice guidelines for other CTSAs to join the effort. In particular, we aim to support and cultivate the growth of next generation medical AI workforce for research and practice. We aim to establish a large cross-CTSA collaborative data sharing for critical care by leveraging the existing CTSA collaborative networks. With the diversified racial, ethnic and geographic profiles from the above CTSAs, we will be able to support fair and generalizable algorithms for advanced patient monitoring and decision support. The proposed project will provide best practice guidance to and set up exemplary examples for nationwide CTSAs. It will also support the cultivation of next generation medical AI researchers.

"Neuroimaging Analysis Center (NAC) Project Summary/Abstract The ability to access huge cohorts of patient medical records and radiology data, the emergence of ever-more detailed imaging modalities, and the availability of unprecedented computer processing power marks the pos- sibility for a new era in neuroimaging, disease understanding, and patient treatment. To unlock the full medical potential made possible by these new technologies, new algorithms and clinically-relevant techniques must be developed by close collaboration between computer scientists, physicians, and medical researchers. We are excited to propose a national resource center with the goal of finding new ways of extracting disease characteristics from advanced imaging and computation, and to make these methods available to the larger medical community through a proven methodology of world-class research, open-source software, and exten- sive collaboration. The overarching theme for this P41 renewal is the discovery and analysis of novel imaging phenotypes to characterize disease. We use the term imaging phenotypes to describe patterns or features of disease that can be detected through imaging (predominantly MRI) followed by machine learning, statistical analysis, feature detection, and correlation with other indicators of disease such as structured patient infor- mation. The three proposed Technology Research & Development (TR&D) projects address this common question us- ing a variety of complementary approaches and clinical testbeds. TR&D 1 addresses microstructure of tissue, including novel imaging methods to detect tumor microstructure. TR&D 2 investigates rich spatial patterns of disease extracted from clinical imaging with a focus on cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative conditions such as stroke. Finally, TR&D 3 proposes novel image and connectivity-based features that can be correlated with a variety of diseases, with a clinical emphasis on pediatric brain development. Technical innovation will be driven by intense collaboration between the TR&Ds and key collaborators in neurosurgery, neurology, and pe- diatrics. The TR&Ds will leverage recent important developments in the fields of image acquisition, machine learning, and data science to identify and exploit novel imaging phenotypes of disease. Building on our long history of developing clinically-relevant methods, each TR&D includes a translational and clinical validation aim to ensure our work is clinically relevant and effective at meeting the driving clinical goals. NAC's proven software engi- neering, translation, and dissemination infrastructure, along with its established network of academic, medical, and industrial partners, enhance the center's value as a national resource.

"Creating an initial ethics framework for biomedical data modeling by mapping and exploring key decision points Project Summary Biomedical data science data modeling is relevant to a plethora of informatics research activities, such as natural language processing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and predictive analytics. As Electronic Health Record systems become more advanced and more mature, with the potential to incorporate a wide and diverse array of data from genomics to mobile health (mHealth) applications, the scope and nature of the biomedical data science questions researchers ask become broader. Concomitantly, the answers to their questions have the potential to impact the care of millions of patients—getting the answers right, proactively, is high stakes. However, in data modeling currently, there is no bioethics framework to guide the process of mapping key decision points and recording the rationale for choices made. Making data modeling decision points, as well as the reasoning behind them, explicit would have a twofold impact on improving biomedical data science by: 1. Enhancing transparency and reproducibility and maximizing the value of data science research and 2. Supporting the ability to assess decision points and rationales in terms of their most crucial ethical ramifications. Research in this area is particularly timely amid the interest in, and enthusiasm for, leveraging Big Data sources in the service of improving patient population health and the health of the general public. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) recently released a strategic plan for data science; there is no better time than now to create an initial bioethical framework to inform common data modeling decision points. The improvements in data quality that will derive from decision point mapping and bioethical review will enhance efforts to apply data models across a range of high-impact areas, from predictive analytics to support clinical decision-making to robust trending models in population health to better inform local, regional, and national health policies and resource allocation. To develop this initial bioethics framework, we will use well- established qualitative research methods (interviews, focus groups, and in-person deliberation) to map the decision points in biomedical data modeling research and document the rationales invoked to support those decisions (Aim 1 key informant interviews); assess those data science decision points and decision-making rationales for their bioethical ramifications (Aim 2 focus groups); and create an initial bioethics data modeling framework (Aim 3 deliberative meeting). This study would be the first to provide a bioethics framework to meet a critical gap in biomedical data modeling activities, where the downstream consequences of developing data models without careful and comprehensive review of ethical issues can be severe. This approach directly supports core scientific values of inclusivity, transparency, accountability, and reproducibility that, in turn, foster trust in biomedical data modeling output and potential applications, whether local, national, or global. Project Narrative This study would be the first to develop an initial bioethics framework to meet a critical gap in biomedical data modeling activities, where the downstream consequences of developing data models without careful and comprehensive review of ethical issues can be severe—not least because poorly developed data models have the potential to impact adversely the health of individuals, groups, and communities. Currently, there is limited conversation around potential bioethics issues in data modeling, and as yet no implementable guidance on how biomedical data science modeling research activities should occur. The initial ethics framework developed by this study would provide a roadmap to ensure that data modeling decision points are documented and their ethical ramifications considered at the outset of model creation, thus supporting core scientific values of inclusivity, accountability, reproducibility, and transparency that, in turn, foster trust in biomedical data modeling output and potential applications, whether local, national, or global.",Creating an initial ethics framework for biomedical data modeling by mapping and exploring key decision points,10250400,R21HG011277,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Bioethical Issues ', ' Bioethics ', ' Biomedical Ethics ', ' Communities ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Health ', ' Health Resources ', ' Interview ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' National Health Policy ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Time ', ' Accountability ', ' Walking ', ' Ethical Issues ', ' Ethical Review ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Fostering ', ' Research Activity ', ' data quality ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' Informatics ', ' Structure ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Modeling ', ' model development ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Bioethicist ', ' Bioethics Consultants ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' informant ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Output ', ' ethical legal social implication ', ' ELSI ', ' ethical, legal, and social ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' interoperability ', ' usability ', ' high standard ', ' patient population ', ' public trust ', ' population health ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' Data Science ', ' individual patient ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' Mobile Health Application ', ' Mobile Health App ', ' m-Health app ', ' m-Health application ', ' mHealth app ', ' mHealth application ', ' clinical decision support ', ' Data Scientist ', ' data tools ', ' biomedical data science ', ' ']",NHGRI,"HASTINGS CENTER, INC.",R21,2021,202625,NY-18
"Methods for High-Dimensional Statistical Inference and Individualized Risk Prediction under Semi-Competing Risks Project Summary/Abstract Patient care has been transformed by the availability of high-dimensional sources like electronic health records (EHR) and genomic data, allowing health care decisions to be tailored to individual patients. Statistical methods have been developed to efﬁciently use such high dimensional data, but critical gaps still remain. Several common models for survival analysis have recently been extended to accommodate high-dimensional variable selection and machine learning prediction methods, but similar tools have not yet been developed for the setting of semi- competing risks. In the semi-competing risks setting, interest focuses on jointly modeling both a terminal time- to-event outcome, as well as a non-terminal time-to-event outcome which can only occur for subjects who have not yet experienced the terminal event. Examples of this exist in severe pregnancy-related diseases such as pre-eclampsia (PE - further described below). PE and subsequent delivery are natural semi-competing risks, as PE can develop before delivery, but not after. Current methods do not provide analysts with data-driven tools for uncovering important covariates from high-dimensional data, and clinicians lack meaningful, personalized predictions of patients' joint probability of experiencing one or both outcomes prospectively through time.  This proposal addresses these methodological gaps with tools for high-dimensional inference and prediction. In Aim 1, I will address the challenge of variable selection by developing a suite of regularized estimators for se- lecting important covariates from large datasets into a semi-competing risks model, and evaluating performance by simulation. In Aim 2, I will create a deep feed forward neural network modeling framework for predicting individual patients' joint probabilities of experiencing one or both outcomes of interest across future time points. Together, these aims will improve personalization of health care decisions. Software will be developed that provides researchers practical and user-friendly tools for applying these methods. In Aim 3, I will apply these approaches for semi-competing risks to evaluate risk of PE, which is globally a leading cause of maternal and fetal/neonatal mortality and morbidity. Using EHR pregnancy data from 50,000 births between 2011-2020, I will use the proposed variable selection methods to develop a model identifying risk factors for PE along with factors affecting time-to-delivery among PE patients. Through this work, I will also build a deep learning model in order to jointly predict maternal PE and NICU admission of the infant, yielding personalized prediction plots to facilitate care decisions that balance maternal and fetal health risks. For ease of use by clinicians and patients, I will disseminate this prediction model using an interactive online tool. Project Narrative  Using personalized risk prediction to help clinicians and patients make health care decisions is a vital and rapidly growing way to improve outcomes and quality of care. However, in the common survival analysis setting known as semi-competing risks where both a non-terminal event and a terminal event are of interest, there lack adequate methods for modeling patients' joint risks using high-dimensional data sources such as electronic health records. The focus of this proposal is the development of statistical and machine-learning methods for this setting to predict individual patients' prospective joint risk over time of experiencing one or both outcomes of interest, and apply them to risk stratiﬁcation and individualized prediction of outcomes for preeclampsia in pregnant women.",Methods for High-Dimensional Statistical Inference and Individualized Risk Prediction under Semi-Competing Risks,10249946,F31HD102159,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' developing country ', ' developing nation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Fellowship ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Infant ', ' Israel ', ' Joints ', ' Maternal Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' Mothers ', ' Neonatal Mortality ', ' neonatal mortalities ', ' newborn death ', ' newborn mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Pre-Eclampsia ', ' EPH Gestosis ', ' Preeclampsia ', ' Pregnancy Toxemias ', ' Proteinuria-Edema-Hypertension Gestosis ', ' pregnancy toxemia/hypertension ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' expectant mother ', ' expecting mother ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' Probability ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' falls ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Lasso ', ' Caring ', ' Premature Birth ', ' Prematurely delivering ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' premature childbirth ', ' premature delivery ', ' preterm delivery ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' insight ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' developed country ', ' developed nation ', ' developed nations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' fetal ', ' interest ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Manuscripts ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' theories ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' neonatal morbidity ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' user-friendly ', ' unborn child ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' tailored health care ', ' tailored healthcare ', ' interactive tool ', ' individual patient ', ' personalized health care ', ' personalized healthcare ', ' precision health care ', ' precision healthcare ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' improved outcome ', ' personalized decision ', ' individualized clinical decision ', ' individualized decision ', ' personalized clinical decision ', ' personalized data-driven decision ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' high dimensionality ', ' personalized risk prediction ', ' Individualized risk prediction ', ' personalized predictions ', ' Individualized Predictors ', ' individualized predictions ', ' personalized predictors ', ' Fetal health ', ' feedforward neural network ', ' feed forward neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' multidimensional data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' neonatal health ', ' newborn health ', ' ']",NICHD,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,F31,2021,34886,MA-07
"Increasing Interoperability of Brain Morphometrics Using FHIR PROJECT SUMMARY With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in medicine, radiologists have new tools at their disposal to quantitatively assess imaging data.

The goal of this project is to reduce data access barriers by developing software to cleanly integrate medical imaging data stored in a radiology department’s picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) with the rest of patients’ electronic health record (EHR) using the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR®) standard. CorticoMetrics will use our THINQ™ software as a medical device (SaMD) product to provide brain morphometrics derived from MR imaging data, and extend its functionality to output results in both Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine structured reporting (DICOM-SR) and Health Level 7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (HL7 FHIR) compliant formats. Based off of the scientifically validated FreeSurfer suite of automated neuroimaging analysis software, THINQ provides measurements of brain structures that can aid in the care of neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and dementia, traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, hydrocephalus, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. Output in FHIR and DICOM-SR formats will be validated and included in CorticoMetrics’ next FDA 510(k) submission of THINQ. Incorporating this information with the rest of the rest of a patient’s EHR will enable a seamless workflow for clinicians to make decisions more efficiently and accurately while also improving the performance of those with less experience. This project will develop and disseminate an open source software tool to interconvert neuroimaging data between formats used in academic settings (such as FreeSurfer’s MGH or Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative (NIfTI)) with the standard formats used in health care settings (DICOM and FHIR). Common Data Elements (CDE) will be used to facilitate data sharing across studies where appropriate. The product will lead to an increase in interoperability of brain morphometrics, giving medical professionals access to key data directly in the EHR. While THINQ will serve as an initial use case of this technology, the conversion tool will be easily extensible to other use cases, and freely available to developers of the next generation of quantitative imaging software. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will develop software using the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR®) standard to integrate quantitative assessment of brain MRI data from CorticoMetrics’ THINQ™ software as a medical device (SaMD) product into existing clinical workflows. FHIR application programming interfaces (APIs) enable seamless connection of medical imaging data and metadata stored in a picture archiving and communication system (PACS) with the rest of patients’ electronic health record (EHR), giving radiologists more information for earlier and more accurate assessment of changes in brain structure that occur in many neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and dementia, traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, hydrocephalus, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. The resulting efforts will lead to the standalone release of open source tools, enhancing the ability to share data within and between health information systems and leading to improved quality of care and reduction in radiology report turnaround time.",Increasing Interoperability of Brain Morphometrics Using FHIR,10255591,R43EB030910,"[""Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Decision Making ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Evaluation Studies ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hydrocephalus ', ' Hydrocephaly ', ' hydrocephalic ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Medical Device ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Medicine ', ' Multiple Sclerosis ', ' Disseminated Sclerosis ', ' insular sclerosis ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Patients ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Rest ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' base ', ' Picture Archiving and Communication System ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Medical ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Evaluation Reports ', ' data quality ', ' Measurement ', ' radiologist ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Informatics ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Health Information System ', ' Reporting ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI Scans ', ' Health Informatics ', ' consumer informatics ', ' Public Health Informatics ', ' Data ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Update ', ' Common Data Element ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' Output ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' interoperability ', ' open source ', ' data exchange ', ' data transfer ', ' data transmission ', ' health information technology ', ' data sharing ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' health data ', ' imaging software ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' application programming interface ', ' application program interface ', ' data access ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources ', ' FHIR ', ' Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine ', ' DICOM ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' Data Store ', ' open source tool ', ' open source toolkit ', ' ']",NIBIB,"CORTICOMETRICS, LLC",R43,2021,149500,MA-06
"Large-scale data integration and harmonization to accurately predict sites facing future health-based drinking water crises Project summary: Up to 45 million people per year in the U.S. are directly impacted by health-based drinking water problems. This leads to at least 16 million cases of acute gastroenteritis directly linked to pollution at community water systems, with tens of millions more directly impacted by chemical and organic pollutants. Impacts are further exacerbated in locations dealing with water scarcity, in under-served populations, and within other vulnerable populations already suffering from health disparities. Many of these water problems are the direct result of managerial negligence, inconsistent monitoring, and a lack of the ability to anticipate where problems may arise next. While the reasons for drinking water problems are complex, if we could anticipate where health-based drinking water problems were to occur in the future, it could have an immediate and positive impact on tens of millions of Americans annually. Interestingly, extensive data about water quality and the performance of municipal water systems already exists in large, disparate databases. These databases are largely ignored and, when used, are typically used only anecdotally and retroactively. Preliminary evidence suggests that these existing databases, which contain histories of administrative violations and sub-threshold water-quality results, can be mined to accurately predict future drinking water crises. The Superior Statistical Research R&D team is an internationally recognized group of water experts with cross-cutting expertise in statistics/data analysis/modelling/computing, water-quality monitoring of biological and chemical contaminants, and the ability to clearly and compellingly translate water-quality and health information to actionable steps for individuals, organizations and communities. In this Phase I project, we will show that it is possible to predict water-related, health-based problem areas utilizing already collected, historical data on water quality and municipal water system performance. We will begin by harmonizing the disparate water quality and municipal water system performance in two different states (Michigan and Iowa). We will then utilize machine-learning techniques to predict health-based violation histories and will evaluate our methods by comparing predicted violations to actual health-based violations in the previous 5 years. Finally, we will identify at least 10 municipalities determined by our algorithm to be at the highest risk for future health- based water problems and will do systematic sampling to confirm our model-based predictions. We will then demonstrate how making these predictions can be leveraged to profitability by exploring how our model-based predictions can be presented to customers in an economical, usable form. Proof of our concept and profitability models in two states (Phase I) will set us up for widespread (multi-state) database harmonization and improvement of the proposed machine-learning/modelling effort in Phase II. With multi-state harmonized datasets, identification of key data gaps in particular states/areas, and proven financial models, our technology will ultimately lead to dramatic reductions in the number of health-based drinking water problems annually. Project Narrative Up to 45 million people per year in the U.S. are directly impacted by health-based drinking water problems, but predicting where and when these health-based drinking water problems will occur remains a large and complex obstacle. Current approaches focus on a reactive approach to health-based water-quality violations in community water systems, rather than a proactive one that seeks to anticipate where problems will occur in the future. The overall goal of this project is to leverage large and disparate historical datasets of water quality to accurately predict locations of future health-based water-quality violations, validate the predictions, and commercialize our proprietary predictions as a practical and cost-saving approach to anticipating and heading off future health-based water problems.",Large-scale data integration and harmonization to accurately predict sites facing future health-based drinking water crises,10253600,R43ES033134,"['Algorithms ', ' Biological Monitoring ', ' Biologic Monitoring ', ' biomonitoring ', ' Serinus ', ' Canaries ', ' Cities ', ' Coal ', ' Communities ', ' Community Surveys ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Filtration ', ' Filtration Fractionation ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Gastroenteritis ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Iowa ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' Persons ', ' Negligence ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' ROC Curve ', ' ROC Analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic curve ', ' Safety ', ' statistics ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' rural location ', ' rural region ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Chemicals ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pollution ', ' Complex ', ' water sampling ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' inner city ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' water quality ', ' drinking water ', ' pollutant ', ' Municipalities ', ' member ', ' economic impact ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' water monitoring ', ' water quality monitoring ', ' water testing ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Monitor ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' willingness to pay ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' data integration ', ' Underserved Population ', ' under served group ', ' under served people ', ' under served population ', ' underserved group ', ' underserved people ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' advocacy organizations ', ' commercialization ', ' high risk ', ' Lead levels ', ' Pb levels ', ' lead level ', ' level of lead ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' data harmonization ', ' harmonized data ', ' ']",NIEHS,"SUPERIOR STATISTICAL RESEARCH, LLC",R43,2021,256579,IA-04
"Developing an Unbiased Machine Learning Tool for Prediction of Acute Coronary Syndrome Abstract Significance: Racial and sex disparities in the diagnosis and care of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients are well documented. As machine learning algorithms (MLA) become more common in healthcare settings, it is imperative to ensure that these methods do not contribute to disparities through biased predictions or differential accuracy across racial and sex groups. Research Question: Can a MLA be trained to be more accurate and less biased than commonly used risk stratification systems for ACS prediction? Prior Work: The research team developed a preliminary gradient boosted tree model for myocardial infarction (MI) prediction using retrospective data from electronic health records. On a hold-out test set, the algorithm classifier attained an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) value of 0.92 when tested for the detection of MI at any point during a patient’s hospital stay. Other prior work by the research team involved development of a MLA to minimize bias in inpatient mortality predictions between White and non-White patient groups. The model was found to be unbiased as measured by the equal opportunity difference (EOD = 0.016, p = 0.204) and outperformed commonly used severity scoring systems MEWS, SAPS-II, and APACHE in respect to bias and accuracy. Specific Aims: In Aim 1, an unbiased model for early ACS prediction will be developed. Preprocessing the MLA training data will remove aspects of the data that reflect systemic health inequities while maintaining the aspects of the data that reflect relevant patient measurements and outcomes. Assessment of equal opportunity difference (EOD) and the Zemel statistic will provide a means to evaluate the MLA’s ability to operate without sex or racial bias. In Aim 2, the model’s performance will be compared to three commonly used ACS risk stratification scores. Evaluating model performance and bias against these systems will allow for comparison of the unbiased MLA to the current ACS standard of care. Methods: Aim 1: An ACS prediction algorithm that will be demonstrated to be unbiased when comparing performance accuracy on White vs. non-White and male vs. female emergency department patients will be developed. The model’s performance will be assessed with regard to the EOD and Zemel statistic, which measure the difference in false negative results and average predicted risk, respectively, between White and non-White and male and female patients under the null hypothesis of no difference. Aim 2: Model performance will be compared to modified versions of three other commonly used ACS risk stratification scores: the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) score; the Platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa in Unstable angina: Receptor Suppression Using Integrilin (eptifibatide) Therapy (PURSUIT) score; and the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) score, some of which have been shown to perform differentially across gender and race. EOD and the Zemel statistic will also be assessed as a measure of bias for the MLA, GRACE, PURSUIT and TIMI scores. Future Directions: The MLA will be implemented in live hospital settings for prospective evaluation. Narrative Race- and sex-related differences in the diagnosis and treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are well documented and can influence patient outcomes. Conventional risk stratification scoring systems used to guide resource allocation and treatment decisions may reflect racial and sex bias in their design and, in some cases, in their implementation. In response to the need for unbiased ACS clinical decision support tools, it is proposed herein to use machine learning to develop and validate an unbiased ACS prediction tool on the basis of electronic health record data to promote accurate and equitable recognition of ACS.",Developing an Unbiased Machine Learning Tool for Prediction of Acute Coronary Syndrome,10258045,R43MD016363,"['Adoption ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Unstable angina ', ' Angina at Rest ', ' Preinfarction Angina ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' California ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Feedback ', ' Female ', ' Platelet Glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa Complex ', ' GP IIb IIIa complex ', ' GPIIb-IIIa Receptors ', ' Glycoproteins IIb-IIIa ', ' Integrin alpha-IIb beta-3 ', ' Integrin alphaIIbbeta3 ', ' glycoprotein IIb IIIa receptor ', ' Future ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary infarction ', ' heart attack ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart infarction ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Probability ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' ROC Curve ', ' ROC Analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic curve ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' San Francisco ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Trees ', ' Universities ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Platelet Glycoproteins ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Sex Bias ', ' Gender Bias ', ' Sexism ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' eptifibatide ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Severities ', ' System ', ' thrombolysis ', ' age group ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' trait ', ' resource guides ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' acute coronary syndrome ', ' RA70 ', ' SAPS ', ' SCAP2 ', ' SKAP-HOM ', ' SKAP55R ', ' SCAP2 gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Mind Research ', ' Mind/Body Research ', ' mind-body research ', ' mind/body method ', ' Mind-Body Method ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Scheme ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' electronic data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' standard of care ', ' clinical practice ', ' health inequalities ', ' Health Inequity ', ' Inequalities in Health ', ' Inequities in Health ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' Acute Coronary Event ', ' Emergency Department patient ', ' ED patient ', ' ER patient ', ' Emergency Room patient ', ' racial disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' support tools ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive tools ', ' racial bias ', ' race bias ', ' sex disparity ', ' disparities in sex ', ' health care disparity ', ' disparate health care ', ' disparate healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' clinical decision support ', ' overtreatment ', ' over-treatment ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' classifier algorithm ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Differences between sexes ', ' Differs between sexes ', ' Sexual differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' algorithm development ', ' acute care ', ' algorithm training ', ' live stream ', ' livestream ', ' ']",NIMHD,"DASCENA, INC.",R43,2021,256585,CA-15
"Opening The Black Box:  Enhancing Machine Learning Interpretability To Optimize Clinical Response To Sudden Deterioration In COVID-19 Patients Project Summary/Abstract Advanced machine learning (ML) has consistently been shown to outperform expert opinion and more simple analytics for predicting clinical outcomes. However, there has been a paucity of successful prospective clinical implementations of such tools. The unique barriers to advanced ML implementation and adoption in healthcare are (1) the technological challenges of running and displaying these models in real-time within existing workflows and (2) a general distrust for black box algorithms among highly skilled providers. As a result, the promise of these tools is largely lost in healthcare. This is particularly problematic in COVID-19, where patients can deteriorate rapidly, from appearing stable to suddenly being in respiratory failure or shock with little obvious warning. Early recognition of this deterioration is vital to proactive interventions, which can improve outcomes. eCART is a predictive analytic that has been developed iteratively at the University of Chicago over the past decade to identify hospitalized patients at risk for acute clinical deterioration. A simple (logistic regression based) ML model (eCARTv2) is commercially available within electronic health records on AgileMD’s clinical decision support platform. eCARTv2 was developed in a retrospective multicenter dataset and its use in clinical practice was associated with a 29% relative risk reduction in mortality in a multicenter trial. Our team recently completed development and validation of a gradient boosted machine (GBM) version of the model (eCARTv4), using nearly 100 variables, including trends and interactions. The advanced ML model was significantly more accurate than the simple ML and other models for predicting acute clinical deterioration across all hospital settings, in both septic and non-septic patients as well as in COVID-19 patients. The next challenge is clinically implementing it. The goals of this project are to a) upgrade the existing AgileMD platform to support the previously derived and validated eCARTv4 model and overhaul the human-machine interface for an advanced user experience (UX) that provides, for the first time, interpretable, graphical insight into the contribution of individual variables to a real-time EHR-embedded advanced ML analytic, and b) measure the impact of the new tool on HCP effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction. We hypothesize that the combination of high accuracy and interpretability afforded by the advanced ML and UX will result in earlier recognition of acute deterioration as well as increased System Usability Scores (SUS) and usefulness scores in the treatment of deteriorating COVID-19 patients over standard care. Project Narrative Advanced machine learning (ML) has the potential to improve patient outcomes by alerting health care providers to early signs of patient deterioration they may otherwise miss. However, clinical teams have been hesitant to fully embrace these tools because of their black box nature and inability to verify the logic underpinning them. This project intends to give medical staff the transparency they need to confidently leverage sophisticated ML tools to better treat hospitalized patients, particularly those with COVID-19.",Opening The Black Box:  Enhancing Machine Learning Interpretability To Optimize Clinical Response To Sudden Deterioration In COVID-19 Patients,10259197,R44EB030955,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Chicago ', ' Goals ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Interview ', ' Logic ', ' Medical Staff ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Shock ', ' Circulatory Collapse ', ' circulatory shock ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' User-Computer Interface ', ' human computer interface ', ' human machine interface ', ' man machine interface ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Workload ', ' Work Load ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Multicenter Trials ', ' Multi-center trial ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' satisfaction ', ' Relative Risks ', ' uptake ', ' septic ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' Expert Opinion ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Provider ', ' lung failure ', ' pulmonary failure ', ' Respiratory Failure ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Validation ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' pandemic disease ', ' pandemic ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Sepsis ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' prospective ', ' usability ', ' standard of care ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' clinical practice ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' improved outcome ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' Retrospective cohort ', ' clinical decision support ', ' clinical implementation ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' COVID-19 ', ' COVID19 ', ' CV-19 ', ' CV19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' Visualization ', ' distrust ', ' COVID-19 patient ', ' COVID infected patient ', ' COVID patient ', ' COVID positive patient ', ' COVID-19 infected patient ', ' COVID-19 positive patient ', ' COVID19 patient ', ' COVID19 positive patient ', ' SARS-CoV-2 infected patient ', ' SARS-CoV-2 patient ', ' SARS-CoV-2 positive patient ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 infected patient ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 patient ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 positive patient ', ' coronavirus disease infected patient ', ' coronavirus disease patient ', ' coronavirus disease positive patient ', ' coronavirus patient ', ' patient infected with COVID ', ' patient infected with COVID-19 ', ' patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 ', ' patient infected with coronavirus disease ', ' patient infected with coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' patient infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ', ' patient with COVID ', ' patient with COVID-19 ', ' patient with COVID19 ', ' patient with SARS-CoV-2 ', ' patient with coronavirus disease ', ' patient with coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' patient with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 ', ' severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infected patient ', ' severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 patient ', ' severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive patient ', ' ']",NIBIB,"AGILEMD, INC.",R44,2021,1995966,CA-12
"Improving the accessibility and relevance of Medical Nutritional Therapy among people with Type 2 diabetes in the Latino community through a customizable, AI-powered application. PROJECT SUMMARY Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) is an effective treatment for managing Type 2 diabetes (T2D), but studies have shown that few T2D patients adhere to or access it. This low utilization rate can be attributed to the small number of registered dietitian nutritionists (RDNs) compared to the number of patients with T2D, limited reimbursement pathways for MNT, and resource constraints in the patient population. These issues are exacerbated in the Latino community due to limited access to care, economic disparities, and few resources tailored to culture identity. Currently, incorporating cultural relevance into an MNT plan must be done manually by an RDN. Existing digital applications focus on meal tracking or discrete biological factors (e.g. gut microbiome), supplementing healthy lifestyles rather than supporting MNT delivery and failing to address personal and cultural factors in meal plan creation and adherence. YumAI is a novel AI-based application that delivers and tracks adherence to MNT-compliant recipes that are customized to factors such as budget, family, location, season, food preferences, and preparation complexity. By automating meal plan adjustment, YumAI brings customized, high-quality MNT directly to patients through an easy-to-use digital application available on desktop computers and personal devices. In this Phase I SBIR project, we will further develop this AI-powered application, incorporating feedback from preliminary testing, ensuring compliance with ADA dietary guidelines and MNT stipulations, and optimizing the software specifically for individuals with T2D of Mexican decent. We will conduct two design thinking workshops to identify product features and discover factors in recipe customization and MNT compliance. Through an iterative design process, we will develop a proof of concept of YumAI and demonstrate algorithmic capabilities that enable basic recipe plan customization. Our two-step approach balances compliance with MNT standards and builds in relevant factors to customize recipe recommendations to user needs. Recognizing the complexity of plan customization and the number of possible dimensions of adherence, the purpose of the research is to demonstrate technical feasibility of a solution that can be enhanced in future development and to identify gaps in data collection. Successful completion of this project will result in a functional prototype of YumAI, the first digital health mechanism for increasing access to MNT for the Mexican population with T2D. This project will provide proof of concept and feasibility for future studies to scale YumAI for a broader population. It will prepare us for a Phase II project that explores in situ interaction with the product and efficacy of the product in solving issues of and patient adherence, cultural awareness, and RDN scalability. PROJECT NARRATIVE Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT), a holistic component of a Type 2 diabetes (T2D) management plan provided by a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN), is shown to improve HbA1c, delay complications of T2D, and lead to significant cost savings compared to other T2D WUeaWPeQW PeWhRdV.

"Spatiotemporal forecasting of COVID-19 by integrating machine learning and epidemiological modeling PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In this ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it is crucial to have an accurate and early prediction of the spread of highly infectious SARS-CoV-2. A correct prediction of the pandemic situation and future trends enables effective resource allocation and government policies to reduce the detrimental effect of COVID-19 on public health and economics. Although various epidemiological models have facilitated the prediction of the infection spread, their ensemble-averaging approach largely disregards critical information within the heterogeneity. Conventional epidemiological modeling is focused on the global average trends, which is limited in analyzing dynamic local information and does not allow local prediction due to spatial heterogeneity of the pandemic situations. Given the rapid changes of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is also challenging to take urgent responses to the new epidemiological data if we solely rely on human intelligence. Recently, machine learning (ML) is making tremendous progress and has shown that computers can outperform humans in analyzing complex high-dimensional datasets. Our lab has been addressing these challenges in cell biology by developing an ML platform for fluorescence live cell image analyses at the subcellular level. We established the method to deconvolve the subcellular heterogeneity of time series of cell protrusion, which identified distinct subcellular protrusion phenotypes with differential drug susceptibility. Thus, our goal is to leverage our ML platform to address these technical challenges in epidemiological modeling for rapid forecasting of COVID-19 spread at the county level in the United States. First, we will advance our ML platform for the deconvolution of spatial heterogeneity of COVID-19 dynamics. This method will integrate epidemiological models and ML to identify the clusters of US counties sharing similar temporal patterns. Second, we will apply our deep learning-based feature learning, where the deep neural networks learn the critical features guided by prior knowledge and well-established epidemiological mathematical models. This will allow us to generate fine-grained forecasting maps of Covid-19 spread. Our ML platform will bring unprecedented prediction power to epidemiology and enable us to take urgent responses to the current COVID-19 pandemic and future other infectious disease outbreaks. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to apply our machine learning framework for automated analyses of county-level dynamics of COVID-19 spread in the United States. By integrating machine learning and epidemiological models, we will identify infectious hot spots and forecast COVID-19 dynamics. This system will automatically update and learn new COVID-19 data and enable urgent predictions.",Spatiotemporal forecasting of COVID-19 by integrating machine learning and epidemiological

"Obesity Health Disparities Research PRIDE Program (OHD PRIDE) ABSTRACT  There is an urgent need to leverage existing scholarly data to develop data-informed interventions to reduce health disparities. Stakeholders associated with the production and use of data have developed a set of principles to make research data findable, accessible, interoperative, and reusable (FAIR). The FAIR guiding principles can facilitate biomedical advancements by bolstering data labeling and management practices to enable artificial intelligence and machine learning innovations. The application of FAIR addresses challenges associated with data annotation and management and can support greater efficiency and effectiveness of data used in this area. Adding training to the FAIR principles to early-career faculty members from groups underrepresented in the biomedical sciences will bolster a diverse scientific workforce capable of understanding and redressing cardiovascular health disparities, such as disparities in obesity and related areas crucial to minority health in the FAIR principles. The three aims of the proposed project are to (1) apply an Educational Design Research approach to the development, refinement, and finalization of online training modules for biomedical scientists to enhance their knowledge and skills in the competencies needed to make research data FAIR and AI/ML-ready; (2) assemble a multi-disciplinary advisory committee consisting of ethicists, legal scholars, policy analysts, biomedical investigators, data scientists, and learning designers to provide feedback; and (3) conduct formative and summative assessments. The training modules developed and tested in the proposed project can inform the development of data-informed interventions to prevent obesity, mitigate its current high rates, and slow their projected rise as crucial steps in reducing cardiovascular disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE FAIR guiding principles can bolster data labeling and management practices to enable artificial intelligence and machine learning innovations.

"NBER Roybal Center for Behavior Change in Health SUMMARY/ABSTRACT NBER Roybal Center for Behavior Change in Health – Overall Health outcomes are affected by myriad mechanisms, including behaviors. An important question is how such behaviors might be influenced in ways that improve health outcomes on a broad population-wide scale. The NBER Roybal Center explores this question by conducting carefully-designed experimental interventions with analytic and theoretical foundations in the behavioral sciences. The interventions are selected to be cost- effective and scalable. Among the categories of health-related behavior we plan to study are interventions to improve nutrition; interventions to increase exercise; interventions to overcome addiction, including tobacco, alcohol, and opioids; interventions to promote preventive care, including vaccinations and incremental utilization of workplace wellness programs; interventions to improve medical adherence, including the filling of pharmaceutical prescriptions; and interventions to improve the decisions of health care providers, including applications of machine learning. The research plan is strengthened by a partnership with Geisinger Clinic, a non-profit health care network and insurer with a rich history of innovative delivery reforms and experimental research to improve population health in an active, well-integrated, health care delivery and community health setting. The NBER-Geisinger partnership provides a core infrastructure for implementing experimental interventions on-site with an engaged and committed health care delivery partner. The Center also engages a collaborative network of leading behavioral scientists from multiple disciplines who conduct the experimental interventions, share research activities and findings, collaborate on joint projects, and brainstorm new intervention opportunities, building from findings in basic science. This application renews the NBER Roybal Center for the next five years. PROJECT NARRATIVE – PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Health is a foundational source of wellbeing for people of all ages. As resilient as human physiology may be, and as random and unexpected as health events may be to any particular person at any particular time, health is also affected by the lifestyle decisions that we make, our behavioral interactions with the medical care system, and how we respond to adverse health events when they occur.

"New Jersey Alliance for Clinical Translational Science: NJ ACTS SUMMARY The COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately impacts members of under-represented minority (URM) communi- ties. Unfortunately, URM and other vulnerable communities remain profoundly under-tested. As such, new ap- proaches are needed to disseminate and accomplish testing that could be generalized across the US. New Jersey can serve as a unique, virtual testing laboratory, ranking 11th in the US in population, 2nd in the US (after NY) in the per capita rate of COVID-19 deaths, and 5th in total cases and represents a highly diverse state with substantial Black and Latinx minority populations. At Rutgers, we have assembled cohorts of healthcare workers (HCWs) to monitor the spread of COVID-19 and to enroll subjects for clinical and vaccine trials. While building our cohorts, we recognized many URMs serve as HCWs or personal care aides often in lower-income roles. Further, we also found these workers were more often infected compared with those with higher income occupations. Given these observations, we posit that HCWs in occupations at lower incomes would facilitate testing among their house- holds and their communities. In a sense, these HCWs can serve as ambassadors to catalyze community-based COVID-19 testing. NJ HEROES TOO (New Jersey Healthcare Essential WoRker Outreach and Education Study - Testing Overlooked Occupations) proposes to approach URM HCWs who we have identified as index individu- als who will act as ambassadors to help expand testing in their households and extended networks. In Aim 1, we will co-design, develop and implement an innovative, HCW-centric outreach intervention strategy to engage Black and Latinx minority communities. We will explore community perceptions about COVID-19 testing, treatment, and vaccination to design COVID-19 testing materials and messages that are culturally tailored to address concerns of Black and Latinx minority communities. In Aim 2, we will conduct a mixed methods study to evaluate the effec- tiveness and cost of: (1) the HCW-focused outreach intervention strategy versus (2) standard community engaged outreach, working with community based organizations (CBOs). We will explore contextual factors (individual, family, and community) affecting COVID-19 testing implementation outcomes and scalability. The primary out- come will be uptake of COVID-19 testing in the targeted populations. We propose testing with the novel Rutgers Clinical Genomics Laboratory/RUCDR saliva test, the first FDA-authorized diagnostic test using saliva to detect SARS-CoV-2 for non-invasive, home based self-testing. We hypothesize that a participatory outreach strategy approach focused on identified index HCWs will mobilize quicker uptake of testing within community settings than best-practice CBO recruitment approaches. We also hypothesize that recruitment through index HCWs will be more successful for hard to reach participants compared to a traditional CBO approach. The strategy focusing on HCWs could easily be expanded to other front-line and essential workers, making the strategy generalizable and sustainable. NARRATIVE Through ongoing follow-up of identified under-represented minority members in existing healthcare worker cohorts, we will advance COVID-19 testing in their communities by providing access to testing for their households and extended families. We will compare this outreach approach with other more conventional means of stimulating testing. In light of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, this research will help us to find better ways to reach members of vulnerable under-represented minority communities to lessen the impact of COVID-19.",New Jersey Alliance for Clinical Translational Science: NJ ACTS,10360219,UL1TR003017,"['Perception ', ' Population Density ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', '

"Crossing space and time: uncovering the nonlinear dynamics of multimodal and multiscale brain activity The brain is a complex dynamical system, with a hierarchy of spatial and temporal scales ranging from microns and milliseconds to centimeters and years. Activity at any given scale contributes to activity at the scales above it and can influence activity at smaller scales. Thus a true understanding of the brain requires the ability to understand how each level contributes to the system as a whole. Most brain research focuses on a single scale (single unit firing, activity in a circuit), which cannot account for the constraints imposed by activities at other scales. The goal of this proposal is to develop a framework for the integration of multiscalar, multimodal measurements of brain activity. One of the challenges in understanding how activity translates across scales is that features that are relevant at one scale (e.g., firing rate) do not have clear analogues at other scales. We address this issue by defining trajectories in “state space” at each scale, where the state space is defined by parameters and time scales appropriate to each type of data. The trajectory of brain activity through state space can uncover features like attractor dynamics and limit cycles that characterize the evolution of activity. Using machine learning along with new and existing multimodal measurements of brain activity (MRI, optical, and electrophysiological), we propose to establish methods that relate trajectories across scales while handling the mismatch in temporal sampling rates inherent in multi-scale data. Specific aims are 1. Create and test a tool for learning how trajectories at fast scales influence activity at slower scales. Different modalities have different inherent temporal resolutions in addition to different types of contrast. Current methods generally downsample the faster modality in some way, losing much information in the process. We will leverage variants on long short-term memory (LSTM) network architectures to learn the relationship between state space trajectories acquired simultaneously with population recording and optical imaging, and with optical imaging and fMRI. 2. Create and test a tool for learning how trajectories at slow scales influence activity at faster scales. Leveraging the same LSTM-based approach, we will learn how slower, larger scale activity affects activity at smaller scales, using whisker stimulation as a test case. We anticipate inclusion of the large scale activity (measured with fMRI or optical imaging) will improve prediction of the response at smaller scales (measured with optical imaging or population recording). Our work will allow us to begin to answer a wide range of questions about how the brain functions (e.g., what type of localized stimulation that will drive the brain to a desired global state? How does modulation of the global brain state affect local information processing?) and provide guidance for future experiments by identifying key features that influence activity across scales. By approaching the whole brain as a complex dynamical system, we will break free from the limitations of previous studies that focus on individual cells or circuits. We also expect our work to stimulate new theories that incorporate multiple scales of activity. The brain is a complex, dynamical system that exhibits structured activity at many different space and time scales. Most existing studies focus on a single scale (for example, spiking of individual neurons or activity in a particular circuit). However, interactions occur across scales and may account for much of the variability observed in the brain. This proposal will develop a framework for integrating data from different scales using machine learning tools. The results will improve our understanding of how the brain functions and serve as a foundation for modeling neuromodulatory treatments for brain disorders.",Crossing space and time: uncovering the nonlinear dynamics of multimodal and multiscale brain activity,10353118,R01EB029857,"['Affect ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Evolution ', ' Exhibits ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Vibrissae ', ' Whiskers ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Nonlinear Dynamics ', ' Non-linear Dynamic ', ' Non-linear Dynamics ', ' Nonlinear Dynamic ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' analog ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Msec ', ' millisecond ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' Structure ', ' Modality ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' optical imaging ', ' optic imaging ', ' Population ', ' brain research ', ' information processing ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' network architecture ', ' temporal measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' dynamic system ', ' dynamical system ', ' predicting response ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' long short term memory ', ' long short term memory network ', ' long short term memory neural network ', ' multiscale data ', ' multi-scale data ', ' ']",NIBIB,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,131945,GA-05
"Informing the Emergency Care of Septic Shock Patients: A Novel Application of Data-Driven Analytics PROJECT SUMMARY Background: Septic shock is a commonly, costly, and deadly condition. There is increasing recognition that septic shock patients vary significantly in terms of (1) clinical presentation, (2) response to treatments, and (3) clinical outcomes. This patient-level heterogeneity may explain why optimal early septic shock management remains poorly understood. Patients with septic shock are four times more likely to die than septic patients without shock. Our preliminary data shows that Black patients have higher odds of mortality from septic shock compared to White patients. Current studies do not characterize patient heterogeneity among septic shock patients and do not explicate pharmacogenetic factors that may influence disparities in outcomes. Objective: Insights from synergistic data types are necessary to provide a more complete understanding of septic shock heterogeneity and hereditable factors that may influence vasopressor response and disparities in outcomes. The overall objective of the proposed research is to characterize both phenotypic and genetic aspects of heterogeneity in septic shock. This work is organized into two aims: (1) Identify Septic Shock Phenotypes Using Advanced Analytic Methods and (2) Quantify Vasopressor Pharmacogenetic Polymorphisms by Race and Vasopressor Response. Our overall hypothesis is that advanced analytic methods applied to clinical and genetic data can identify defining features of septic shock heterogeneity that are relevant to early septic shock management in the Emergency Department and disparities in outcomes. Methods: (Aim 1) We will use a national dataset of septic patients with hypotension refractory to initial Emergency Department fluid resuscitation and apply unsupervised machine learning clustering methods to define clinically relevant phenotypes of early septic shock patients. We will analyze phenotypic variation in clinical characteristics and outcomes. Then, we will develop a supervised model for phenotype classification. (Aim 2) We will perform targeted pharmacogenomics of 100 samples balanced for race, 73 of which are part of an existing research biobank of septic shock patients from our urban, safety-net hospital. We will enroll an additional 27 patients to complete the sample. We will examine the presence of risk alleles of single nucleotide polymorphisms for vasopressor-relevant genes by race. We will also examine the association between the targeted genetic polymorphisms and shock reversal.

"Project Motivate: A digital motivation and prediction platform to improve treatment retention and reduce relapse in opioid use disorder PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The opioid crisis is the deadliest drug epidemic in American history and new approaches are needed. One novel approach includes predicting likelihood of opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment retention by assessing someone’s risk of early departure from treatment. Current methods to improve treatment retention rely on providers using their intuition to identify when an individual is at risk of leaving treatment early in order to intervene, which often happens too late. Mobile health and machine learning predictive analytics offer a new opportunity to personalize OUD treatment, improve retention in OUD care, and mitigate the risk of relapse and overdose episodes. Project Motivate will combine physiological and behavioral data from disparate sources in order to predict when an individual is at risk of early departure from OUD treatment. This data will be displayed in a user-friendly manner so that providers can more effectively support patients to remain in treatment with timely intervention and responses. PROJECT NARRATIVE Early departure from opioid use disorder treatment programs is common, with early termination rates over 50% for many opioid use disorder treatments, putting individuals at an increased risk of relapsing, overdose and death. Using physiological monitoring tools to predict the likelihood that someone is at risk of early departure from opioid use disorder treatment due to worsening symptoms and/or cravings will allow for proactive interventions that will improve treatment retention. Making an impact here will not only save lives, but it will also lower medical costs, municipal emergency response costs, recidivism, workplace accidents, lost workplace productivity and costs to families.",Project Motivate: A digital motivation and prediction platform to improve treatment retention and reduce relapse in opioid use disorder,10339079,R43DA051279,"['Accidents ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemic ', ' Family ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Methods ', ' Physiologic Monitoring ', ' Physiological Monitoring ', ' Motivation ', ' Overdose ', ' Patients ', ' Productivity ', ' Relapse ', ' Risk ', ' Time ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' medical costs ', ' Caring ', ' Workplace ', ' Job Location ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Site ', ' Work Location ', ' Work Place ', ' Work-Site ', ' Worksite ', ' work setting ', ' improved ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Intuition ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Source ', ' American ', ' Municipalities ', ' treatment program ', ' recidivism ', ' craving ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' user-friendly ', ' overdose death ', ' overdose fatalities ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' Emergency response ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' opioid use disorder ', ' opiate use disorder ', ' relapse risk ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' opiate crisis ', ' opioid crisis ', ' ']",NIDA,"BIOMOTIVATE, LLC",R43,2021,55000,PA-18
"Identification of Postoperative Pulmonary Complication Risk by Phenotyping Adult Surgical Patients who Underwent General Anesthesia with Mechanical Ventilation ABSTRACT Science: One in five patients who develop a postoperative pulmonary complication (PPC) dies within 30 days of surgery. PPCs are the second most frequent surgical complications and lead to increased admission to intensive care units, longer hospital length of stay, and high resource utilization. Ventilator induced lung injury (VILI) secondary to intraoperative mechanical ventilation is a risk for PPCs. Lung protective ventilation, which entails lower tidal volume, sufficient positive end expiratory pressure, optimal inspiratory time and an alveolar recruitment maneuver, has been adopted for intraoperative use to protect pulmonary parenchyma against VILI and ultimately reduce PPC incidence. However, we still do not know the optimal ventilator parameters to yield the lowest incidence of PPCs, because what is best varies from patient to patient. Personalized ventilator parameters are a potential solution to solve this problem. A retrospective study leveraging electronic health records (EHRs) is proposed to identify PPC risks by phenotyping adult surgical patients who underwent general anesthesia with mechanical ventilation. The specific aims of this project are to: (1) Examine the incidence of PPCs in the overall study population and phenotype patients based on nonmodifiable patient, surgical, and anesthesia characteristics; and examine the incidence of PPCs within each phenotypic subgroup; (2) Determine the optimal modifiable intraoperative ventilatory parameters associated with the lowest severity of PPCs within each phenotypic subgroup; and (3) Explore machine learning algorithms for predictive models of the incidence of PPCs on patient, surgical, and anesthesia characteristics as well as intraoperative ventilator parameters. The goal of this aim is to gain knowledge and training in machine learning to lay a foundation for postdoctoral training. Training: My long-term training goal is to become a leading nurse scientist in precision health using data science to improve patient outcomes following surgery, such as reducing PPCs. To achieve this goal, I have three short-term goals during my fellowship training: (1) gain knowledge and skills in research design to enhance precision health in anesthesiology to, (2) gain knowledge in advanced analytic techniques for conducting research using big data, and (3) gain an advanced understanding of pulmonary physiology and pathophysiology that influence anesthesia and patient surgical outcomes. This fellowship will allow me protected time to reach my training goals and to build a foundation for my long-term career goals. During the next twenty-six months as a trainee, I will obtain additional training in (1) research methods and design, (2) advanced statistical methods, (3) precision health, and (4) advanced pulmonary physiology and pathophysiology. PROJECT NARRATIVE This retrospective observational study leveraging electronic health records will improve our understanding of risks for lung complications after surgery that are associated with high mortality and morbidity. Knowledge gained from this study will inform development of interventions to reduce the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications and improve the surgical patients’ outcomes.",Identification of Postoperative Pulmonary Complication Risk by Phenotyping Adult Surgical Patients who Underwent General Anesthesia with Mechanical Ventilation,10311613,F31NR020128,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anesthesia procedures ', ' Anesthesia ', ' General Anesthesia ', ' Anesthesiology ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Complication ', ' Fellowship ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Literature ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Morbidity -

"MUST Data Science Research Hub (MUDSReH) Overall Research Plan Project Summary. Significance. Data science hold great promise for sub-Saharan Africa, yet research capacity and appropriate training are limited. Medical images are particularly exciting for data science in this setting given their ability to facilitate care delivery across healthcare cadres. Efforts to translate the knowledge gained through data science into improved clinical care can be fostered through implementation science. Strategic multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional partnerships will be key for the development and ultimate impact of data science for African-based solutions. Innovation. This proposal is innovative in 1) its use of data science with medical images for advancing clinical care, and 2) integration of data science with implementation science to promote clinical impact. Approach. The Mbarara University Data Science Research Hub (MUDSReH) in Uganda will use multiple technologies to improve the capture of medical images and employ key data science methods, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, to expand their utilization in sub-Saharan Africa. Clinical impact will be strengthened through implementation science methods. Formal training will be available for both data science and implementation science, and ongoing expansion of efforts will be promoted through regional summits and collaboration. The two initial research projects—optimized posterior fundus imaging to diagnose posterior segment eye disease and mobile- phone based cervical images to detect cancer—will involve partnerships with the College of Ophthalmologists of Eastern, Central and Southern Africa in Kenya and the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology in Ghana, respectively. Massachusetts Institute of Technology will provide technical support for data management and analysis, and Massachusetts General Hospital will support the use of implementation science and other relevant content areas for individual research projects. Each project will work with local Ministries of Health, community-based organizations, and/or technology partners to advance the mission of harnessing medical images for improved clinical outcomes and impact. Our specific aims are as follows:  1. To integrate all partnering academic institutions, technology companies, and non-governmental  organizations to advance data science for medical imaging. All partners will contribute to a common  infrastructure for data processing and analysis. We will establish both the administrative and technical  mechanisms for data exchange, accounting for necessary data security and quality assurance and control.  We will further create pathways for facile expansion to include additional research projects involving  medical imaging (e.g., in radiology and dermatology) at multiple African institutions.  2. To integrate implementation science with data science to advance clinical impact. All research  projects in the MUDSReH will include implementation science methodologies to ensure the developed  technology reaches the end user in practical ways that meet local needs and priorities. Overall Research Plan Project Narrative Medical images offer great potential for supporting clinical diagnosis and care management; however, their utility for African researchers and clinicians are limited by the number of images available, insufficient linkage to relevant clinical data, limited data from African populations for proper image interpretation, and poor implementation in clinical practice. The Mbarara University Data Science Research Hub is designed to overcome these barriers through robust Data Management and Analysis and Administrative Cores, initially supporting projects in posterior segment eye disease and cervical cancer with plans for expansion to new projects and sites, as well as training in data science and implementation science.",MUST Data Science Research Hub (MUDSReH),10312539,U54TW012043,"['Accounting ', ' Africa ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Central Africa ', ' Eastern Africa ', ' Southern Africa ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Attention ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervix Uteri ', ' Cervix ', ' Uterine Cervix ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health delivery systems ', ' health services delivery ', ' Dermatology ', ' Diabetic Retinopathy ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Equipment ', ' Eye diseases ', ' eye disorder ', ' ophthalmopathy ', ' Future ', ' Ghana ', ' Gold Coast ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Priorities ', ' General Hospitals ', ' Institutes ', ' Kenya ', ' Macular degeneration ', ' Macular degenerative disease ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Policy Making ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Translating ', ' Uganda ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Data Security ', ' Data awareness ', ' information security ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' base ', ' quality assurance ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Cervical ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Data Linkages ', ' Record Linkage Study ', ' Fostering ', ' Logistics ', ' data quality ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' Ophthalmologist ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' Nongovernmental Organizations ', ' Non-governmental Organizations ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Techniques ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' Posterior Eye Segment ', ' Posterior eyeball segment structure ', ' data management ', ' care delivery ', ' skills ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Academia ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Collection ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' data integration ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' implementation science ', ' clinical care ', ' clinical practice ', ' data exchange ', ' data transfer ', ' data transmission ', ' technology diffusion ', ' Data Science ', ' open data ', ' open science ', ' open-source data ', ' fundus imaging ', ' clinical database ', ' data infrastructure ', ' algorithm development ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' data harmonization ', ' harmonized data ', ' ']",FIC,MBARARA UNIVERSITY/SCIENCE/ TECHNOLOGY,U54,2021,1294298,
"Multi-objective representation learning methods for interpetable predictions of patient outcomesusing electronic health records Project Summary/Abstract This project proposes new methods for representing data in electronic health records (EHR) to improve pre- dictive modeling and interpretation of patient outcomes. EHR data offer a promising opportunity for advancing the understanding of how clinical decisions and patient conditions interact over time to inﬂuence patient health. However, EHR data are difﬁcult to use for predictive modeling due to the various data types they contain (con- tinuous, categorical, text, etc.), their longitudinal nature, the high amount of non-random missingness for certain measurements, and other concerns. Furthermore, patient outcomes often have heterogenous causes and re- quire information to be synthesized from several clinical lab measures and patient visits. The core challenge at hand is overcoming the mismatch between data representations in the EHR and the assumptions underly- ing commonly used statistical and machine learning (ML) methods. To this end, this project proposes novel wrapper-based methods for learning informative features from EHR data. Both methods propose specialized operators to handle sequential data, time delays, and variable interactions, and have the capacity to discover underlying clinical rules/decisions that affect patient outcomes. Importantly, both methods also produce archives of possible models that represent the best trade-offs between complexity and accuracy, which assists in model interpretation. These method advances are made possible by encoding a rich set of data operations as nodes in a directed acyclic graph, and optimizing the graph structures using multi-objective optimization. The central hypothesis of this research is that multi-objective optimization can learn effective data representations from the EHR to produce accurate, explanatory models of patient outcomes. Preliminary work has shown that these methods can effectively learn low-order data representations that improve the predictive ability of several state- of-the-art ML methods. This technique demonstrates good scaling properties with high-dimensional biomedical data. Aim 1 (K99) is to develop a multi-objective feature engineering method that pairs with existing ML methods to iteratively improve their performance by constructing new features from the raw data and using feedback from the trained model to guide feature construction. In Aim 2 (K99), this method is applied to form predictive models of the risk of heart disease and heart failure using longitudinal EHR data. The resultant models will be inter- preted with the help of mentors in order to translate predictions into clinical recommendations. For Aim 3 (R00), a second method is proposed that uses a similar framework to optimize existing neural network approaches in order to simplify their structure as much as possible while maintaining accuracy. The goal of Aim 4 (R00) is to identify hospital patients who are at risk of readmission and propose point-of-care strategies to mitigate that risk. This goal is facilitated through the application of the proposed methods to patient data collected from the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, the Geisinger Health System, and publicly available EHR databases. Project Narrative  Understanding how clinical decisions interact with a patient's health and environmental over time to inﬂuence patient outcomes is central to the goals of enhancing health, reducing illness and improving quality of life.

"Elucidating symptoms clusters in multiple sclerosis using patient reported outcomes and unsupervised machine learning PROJECT SUMMARY  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease affecting 900,000 persons in the U.S, and it is a leading cause of disability among young adults. Persons with MS (PwMS) experience wide-ranging symptoms across multiple domains, alone or in combination, with varied severity. Some of these symptoms include optic nerve dysfunction and vision problems, muscle weakness, bladder/bowel dysfunction, tremors, cognitive and emotional problems, and incoordination. The objectives of the current application are to identify and characterize symptom patterns and clusters in PwMS, which are aligned with PA-17-462, that states: “multiple sclerosis (is a) … model condition to advance (symptom) cluster research”. Thus, our analytical framework will inform research in other poly-symptomatic conditions.  Stakeholders agree that the benefits of patient reported outcomes (PROs) and measures (PROMs) have not reached their full potential for PwMS. PROs, which provide invaluable insight into the patients’ perspective, are increasingly used in MS clinical trials and clinical practice as standard clinical measures fail to adequately measure impairment across domains or lack sensitivity to detect subtle but meaningful change. Aligning with ongoing global MS initiatives, the current proposal will focus on identifying and characterizing symptom patterns and clusters for PROs; which is also directly aligned with NOT-OD-20-079, a Notice of Special Interest to stimulate “research to improve the interpretation of PROs at the individual patient level for use in the clinical practice”. Furthermore, there is an additional incentive to maximize the use and interpretation of PROs considering the shift to telemedicine service in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  We have assembled a multi-disciplinary team of research scientists and clinical experts with access to two unparalleled data resources (discovery and validation data sets), the 1st being the North American Research Committee on Multiple Sclerosis (NARCOMS) Registry’s survey data for 21,558 PwMS spanning an average of 8.4 years (0.5 to 14 years) and 269,468 biannual surveys, and the 2nd being the structured electronic health records (EHRs) for 8,687 PwMS see at the Mellen Center for MS Treatment and Research (MCMS) at the Cleveland Clinic, spanning an average of 4 years (0.5-8.4 years) and 67,932 visits. In both resources, 11 MS-specific PROMs (MS-PROMs) were longitudinally captured including measures of mobility, dexterity, vision, fatigue, cognition, bladder/bowel, sensory, spasticity, depression, tremor/coordination, and pain. We propose the four complementary aims that will: 1. Characterize overall longitudinal impairment patterns for each 11 MS-PROMs; 2. Identify distinct clusters of Pw MS with similar symptom patterns within and across functional domains using machine learning approaches; 3. Develop new approaches to assess the strength of causal inference and identify sources of model prediction errors in unsupervised machine learning; and 4. Create a dynamic simulation dashboard for predicting MS phenotypes based on the findings of aims 1-3.  With these aims, we seek to advance MS phenotyping to facilitate improvements in research, clinical care, and approaches to self-management. By focusing on PROMs, we will leverage the experience of PwMS which is independent of their location (i.e. applications to rural residents) and ideal for telemedicine. We hope that our findings will advance care and empower PwMS to engage in health decisions where personalized phenotypic characterization is necessary. PROJECT NARRATIVE There are 900,000 Americans living with multiple sclerosis (MS), who experience wide-ranging symptoms across multiple domains, alone or in combination, with varied severity. Key barriers to clinical management and future research include the absence of 1) knowledge regarding patterns in MS symptom development, and 2) knowledge of specific patient clusters who share similar symptom patterns and as a result may differentially respond to various interventions. In this project, we will use data analytic and machine learning techniques to characterize and identify symptom patterns/clusters within and across functional domains using MS-specific patient reported outcome measures, and build an adjunctive predictive dashboard informed by these findings that can assist clinicians and patients in disease management.",Elucidating symptoms clusters in

"Ultrasonic Imaging of Bone Graft Healing in Extraction Sockets for Precise and Personalized Implant Therapy Abstract Socket augmentation after tooth extraction by placing either allograft or xenograft bone particulates in the socket is frequently applied to reduce jawbone volume shrinkage for subsequent implant placement. Socket healing after the augmentation varies largely, ranging from uneventful healing to infection, failure of bone graft integration and severe bone loss due to bacterial infection and/or local/systemic conditions. The healing duration, which dictates the timing of implant placement, is widely different as well. Currently, an arbitrary waiting time of 6 months after socket augmentation is adopted, when a 2-dimensional (2D) or 3D radiograph, along with a visual examination is performed to assess hard- and soft-tissue healing to determine the readiness and strategy for the subsequent implant surgery. However, 3D radiographs are not recommended for longitudinal use to monitor socket healing due to radiation concerns. They have lower image resolution (250-500 µm), which limits their ability to evaluate bone surface healing, and inferior soft tissue contrast. A non-radiation and point-of-care method that can evaluate both hard- and soft-tissue longitudinally is much needed for a definitive, accurate, and timely diagnosis of socket healing pathologies. A high-frequency and miniature-sized intraoral ultrasound probe that can operate on an off-the-shelf scanner has been manufactured in collaboration with industry (see support letter) by our research team. Research conducted by our group demonstrated accuracy of this probe in measuring various oral and dental structures. The central hypothesis is to develop ultrasound-based imaging to characterize and grade socket healing lesions in determining the extent and severity of disease. To test this hypothesis, two aims are proposed: Aim 1. Evaluate the diagnostic value of ultrasonic images for bone grafting procedures of dental extraction sockets in a longitudinal clinical study (from -2 months to +6 months of graft placement). We will compare other imaging and clinical diagnostic tools for assessing hard- and soft tissue, anatomical and physiological status throughout the longitudinal study time-course. Aim 2. Develop an extended-view scan-mode for acquiring large field- of-view jawbone images and determine buccal (facial) to lingual tissue morphology. We will engage the manufacturer (see support letter) to modify the existing scanner for this dental specific application. Design goals will include the creation of an extended, large angle, field-of-view to visualize the buccal to lingual jaw bone surface and to create machine learning based measurement tools, including soft- and hard-tissue thickness and surface analysis. Successful execution of the proposed aims will result in an imaging-based tool for longitudinal socket augmentation evaluation that is based on soft- and hard-tissue features and will allow the care provider to choose deviation from current clinical procedures where indicated. This would be investigated subsequently in a specifically designed clinical trial. Narrative The goals of this investigation are to follow dental patients that require bone grafts before their dental implant is placed and to demonstrate the diagnostic opportunities that ultrasound adds to the current standard of clinical dental care. 3",Ultrasonic Imaging of Bone Graft Healing in Extraction Sockets for Precise and Personalized Implant Therapy,10427073,R56DE030872,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Bacterial Infections ', ' bacteria infection ', ' bacterial disease ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' bone ', ' Bone Transplantation ', ' Bone Grafting ', ' bone transplant ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Dental Care ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' dental service ', ' Dental caries ', ' Caries ', ' Dental Decay ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Implants ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Implantation procedure ', ' implant placement ', ' implant procedure ', ' Industry ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' Jaw ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Methods ', ' Miniaturization ', ' Miniaturisations ', ' Organ Transplantation ', ' Grafting Procedure ', ' Organ Transplants ', ' organ allograft ', ' organ graft ', ' organ xenograft ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Ionizing radiation ', ' Ionizing Electromagnetic Radiation ', ' Radiation-Ionizing Total ', ' ionizing output ', ' Research ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Time Study ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tooth Extraction ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' United States ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' X-Ray Radiation ', ' X-ray ', ' Xray ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Lateral ', ' Site ', ' Surface ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Lesion ', ' soft tissue ', ' Oral cavity ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Mouth ', ' Dental ', ' Failure ', ' Blood flow ', ' Visual ', ' Measurement ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Morphology ', ' Atrophy ', ' Atrophic ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' application of bone xenograft ', ' bone heterograft ', ' bone xenograft ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Scanning ', ' Oral ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Particulate ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' Allografting ', ' Inferior ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' dental structure ', ' experience ', ' bone loss ', ' Structure ', ' Bone Surface ', ' Radiation ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' point of care ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cone-beam computed tomography ', ' cone-beam CT ', ' volume CT ', ' volume computed tomography ', ' volumetric computed tomography ', ' graft healing ', ' oral care ', ' healing ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Implant ', ' two-dimensional ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' bone healing ', ' bone wound healing ', ' osseous wound healing ', ' graft failure ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' clinical diagnostics ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' Wait Time ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R56,2021,642438,MI-12
"SCH: INT: A Virtual Surgery Simulator to Accelerate Medical Training in Cardiovascular Disease The objective of the parent proposal is to devise and deploy an integrated virtual surgery simulator to transform training and surgical planning in cardiovascular medicine. By advancing science in graphics, visualization and real-time simulations, and interfacing with virtual reality (VR) technology, we will offer clinical trainees insight into cardiac physiology and pathology, accelerating knowledge acquisition and intuition-building in ways not possible with current tools. Despite recent advances in cardiovascular patient-specific modeling and blood flow simulation, current virtual surgery capabilities are limited to cumbersome by-hand model manipulations and blood flow simulations run on high-performance computing clusters for days at a time. These complexities preclude hands- on use by clinicians and often limit the models to a small cohort of anatomic designs. To drive this technology, the parent proposal contained the following specific aims: 1) Develop computer-graphics tools for efficient model manipulation, 2) Integrate reduced-order modeling with visualization to create a real-time interactive experience, and 3) Develop and deploy an interactive VR educational environment for medical students and clinical trainees. In support of these efforts, in this supplement proposal we will ready the Vascular Model Repository (VMR) for use in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine / deep learning (ML/DL) applications. The VMR is an open database of medical image data, segmented vascular models, and blood flow simulation results developed with support from the National Library of Medicine. We will use the VMR to support two major AI/ML efforts in the community. First, we will greatly accelerate anatomic model construction by DL for image segmentation, overcoming a major bottle neck to studies with large cohorts of patients. Second, we will develop physics-informed ML methods to drastically reduce current lengthy simulation times and provide fast and interactive feedback for surgical and interventional planning. This will produce fast and deployable ``digital twins'' that can provide interactive feedback to clinicians; these methods will be in direct support of the parent proposal and of general interest to the field. The supplement proposal contains three specific aims: 1) To ready the VMR for AI/ML by users who are not domain experts and spark interest in cardiovascular applications in the ML community, 2) To run community challenges in image segmentation and physics-informed ML at a major international meeting to identify best in class ML/DL methods, and 3) To demonstrate ML/DL methods in interactive surgical planning applications by integrating efforts with the parent proposal. We will disseminate our findings, methods, data, and source code to the research community via the open source SimVascular software project and the open data VMR. Our team brings together expertise in cardiovascular biomechanics and finite element modeling, computer graphics and reduced order modeling, physics informed ML, and development of open source and open data resources for the scientific community. The parent proposal aims to create an integrated virtual surgery simulator to transform training and surgical planning in cardiovascular medicine, overcoming limitations of current methods that require cumbersome by-hand model manipulations and expensive simulations. To achieve this, we will integrate advancements in computer graphics, fast reduced order models and virtual reality tools designed to foster education.

"Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population - AI/ML Supplement PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population This application extends a long-running NBER program project on the health and wellbeing of an aging population. Our research plan focuses on better understanding health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and the effective use of health care resources to improve outcomes for an aging population in an evolving landscape. Project 1 (Case and Deaton) explores variations in health trends across geography, race and ethnicity, education, and cohort, identifying and analyzing the life circumstances of those whose health and wellbeing have worsened. Project 2 (Maestas) focuses on the increasing prevalence of pain and opioid use, and their relationship to health outcomes, work, and disability program enrollment. Project 3 (Duflo) analyzes the rapid rise in chronic disease in aging, poorer populations (focusing on India), and the potential role of public policy interventions in improving health in a global context. Project 4 (Baicker and Obermeyer) applies machine learning tools to administrative data to identify overuse (reflecting care with little health benefit relative to its cost or risks) and underuse (reflecting missed opportunities for health benefits) of medical services, focusing on the case of diagnostic testing. Project 5 (Kolstad and Handel) analyzes the impact of information technology in physician treatment decisions, and the potential health benefits of expanded use of IT in health care. Project 6 (Chandra and Sacarny) looks at how information about provider quality affects patients' decisions about their medical care, and whether information on quality improves health care market performance through competition. Project 7 (Baicker and Finkelstein) looks at the effect of public health insurance on health care and outcomes for poor adults, using a randomized controlled design enabled by Oregon's health insurance lottery. Project 8 (Williams) looks at policies that stimulate or impede research and innovation in medicine, and the degree to which the “new uses” problem results in underinvestment in innovations with a potentially positive social value. The program project leverages synergies in methods, data sources, and health issues addressed, building on common themes of health trends and disparities, the role of information for patients and providers, and the potential for different policies to improve health. This research has particular importance in the context of societal changes in demographics, population health, health policy, health care organization, and medicine. The program project will also continue to serve as the organizational foundation for a much larger community of scholars engaged in health-related research at the NBER, attracting some of the most talented scientists from each new generation of economists to the study of health issues. Linking this community to health researchers in other disciplines, particularly in medical and clinical fields, is an important new aim of the program, fostering the cross-disciplinary approaches needed to tackle the most pressing health issues facing an aging population. PROJECT NARRATIVE – PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The goal of the program project is to better understand health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and approaches to improving health in an evolving landscape. It does this through eight component research projects on health and health care, and three cores that coordinate, integrate and leverage the program as a whole. Key themes are understanding recent trends in health and morbility, the disparities in health care and health across the population, the role of patient and provider information, and the potential for different policies to improve health outcomes.",Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population - AI/ML Supplement,10412426,P01AG005842,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Foundations ', ' Geography ', ' Glues ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' India ', ' Insurance ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Leadership ', ' Maintenance ', ' Medicine ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Oregon ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Public Policy ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Social Values ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Talents ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Data Security ', ' Data awareness ', ' information security ', ' Decision Aid ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Discipline ', ' Fostering ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Health Care Markets ', ' Healthcare Market ', ' Services ', ' health care organization ', ' healthcare organization ', ' healthcare service organization ', ' health care service organization ', ' Performance ', ' cohesion ', ' synergism ', ' cohort ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Update ', ' trend ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' health economics ', ' Information Technology ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' demographics ', ' aging population ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' public health relevance ', ' population health ', ' improved outcome ', ' opioid use ', ' opiate consumption ', ' opiate drug use ', ' opiate intake ', ' opiate use ', ' opioid consumption ', ' opioid drug use ', ' opioid intake ', ' health care disparity ', ' disparate health care ', ' disparate healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' data access ', ' data archive ', ' data library ', ' Health trends ', ' Wellbeing trends ', ' Wellness trends ', ' well being trends ', ' data resource ', ' care outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' public health insurance ', ' public insurance ', ' randomized controlled design ', ' ']",NIA,NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH,P01,2021,318837,MA-05
"Administrative Supplement to Support Collaborations to Improve AI/ML-Readiness SUMMARY This application is for an administrative supplement (revision) to an existing award, R33AG068931, ""Advanced Development and Utilization of Assembled Aging Trajectory Files from Multiple Datasets."" The goal of the parent study is to create a comprehensive research repository of aging trajectory datasets and to demonstrate their utility for aging research at Rutgers University through 4 specific aims: 1) Harmonizing and merging multiple data sets to generate the data infrastructure needed to understand change over time in care settings, geriatric syndromes, physical functioning, and shared risk factors at multiple levels and across multiple domains, 2) Developing state-of-the-art analytic methods to identify patterns of aging trajectories experienced by older adults during the final years of life and their association with shared risk factors and distal outcomes, 3) Discovering multilevel and potentially interactive predictors of trajectories using both model-based approaches and machine learning algorithms to predict specific outcomes, and 4) Disseminating resources generated including datasets, documentation, source code, and methodology. For the supplement, new work in the CMS Virtual Research Data Center (VRDC) will create AI/ML-ready datasets, workflows, and source code for data cleaning and pre-processing, breaking the siloed barriers between researchers working in the VRDC and institutional data enclaves at Universities. Data harmonization procedures need to be customized to the server architecture and resources of each data warehouse, necessitating VRDC-specific workflows and code to ensure timely access and reproducibility. In this project, data are made AI/ML-ready in four stages: 1) the cohort of patients to be studied is defined and key inclusion and exclusion criteria variables are selected; 2) data pre-processing steps include data cleaning, data annotation, formatting, standardizing taxonomies, variables transformation, data rescale/normalization, variable aggregating, variable decomposing and variable selection with a focus on variables important to measure health disparities and improve minority health and reduce health disparities; 3) feature extraction and engineering include generating derived variables (e.g., intercept, slope, average, etc.) from irregularly spaced individual trajectories; and 4) Medicare data sets are merged with publicly available data to add socioeconomic and environmental context, and data variable relationships are mapped to produce a final, AI/ML-ready data. Supplement Aim. Develop and implement code for data pre-processing, data fine-tuning and precision, missing data imputation, data connectivity and fully established hierarchical relationships for the AI/ML framework to interactively model late-life aging trajectories and selected outcomes in a cohort of Medicare beneficiaries. Completion of this work will contribute to the NIH vision of a modernized and integrated biomedical data ecosystem that adopts the latest data science technologies, and best practice guidelines including FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles and open-source development.

"Clear Volume Imaging with Machine Learning: a novel tool to identify brain-wide neuronal ensembles of opioid relapse in rat models This project is in response to PA-18-437 “Cutting-Edge Basic Research Awards (CEBRA)”. Over the two past decades, there has been a large increase in the abuse of prescription and illegal opioids; this increase coincides with increases in opioid-related deaths. A critical challenge is the occurrence of relapse in treated patients, especially given that relapse episodes carry a risk of overdose. There is a need to improve our understanding of the brain mechanisms of opioid relapse, which hopefully will result in the identification of targeted circuitry-based treatments. We propose to develop a high-throughput computation system termed Clear Volume Analysis with Machine Learning (CVA-ML). We will combine CVA-ML with a rat-optimized version of the whole brain immunostaining and clearing method iDISCO+ and a new rat model of opioid relapse after voluntary abstinence to identify brain- wide neuronal ensembles of opioid relapse. We recently adapted the iDISCO+ method to intact rat brains and developed experimental methods for Fos immunostaining, brain clearing, and light sheet fluorescence microscopy imaging. However, incorporation of the iDISCO+ method to large scale rat studies is currently limited by (1) lack of ABA-CCF-comparable high-resolution 3D rat brain atlas that allows for high-resolution registration of the activity signal in the 3D space, and (2) lack of an automated data analysis pipeline. In Aim 1, we propose to develop a data analysis pipeline that will take light sheet fluorescence microscopy- generated rat brain images and automatically register them into a custom-made 3D rat brain atlas encompassing a converted Paxinos and Watson rat’s brain atlas. As part of Aim 1, we also propose to develop machine-learning methods to identify and analyze the whole brain Fos signals in 3D space. In Aim 2, we propose to use the methods we developed in Aim 1 to identify brain-wide patterns of neuronal activity (‘neural ensembles’) that encode opioid relapse after voluntary abstinence induced by imposing adverse consequences (electric barrier) that results in long-term cessation of opioid (oxycodone) self-administration. Our proposal addresses the goal of PA-18-437: “to develop, and/or adapt, revolutionary techniques or methods for addiction research.” The anticipated outcomes of our proposal are an open-source software package to automatically analyze iDISCO+ data of rat brains, and a rat whole brain activity map for opioid relapse, assessed using a new rat model. The publicly available software will be easy to modify and can be used by investigators to identify brain-wide neuronal ensembles underlying drug relapse and other motivated behaviors in rats. Project Narrative This project seeks to develop a high-throughput computation system and combine it with the whole brain clearing method iDisco+ and a novel rat model of relapse after voluntary abstinence opioid relapse model to identify brain-wide neuronal ensembles of opioid relapse.

"NorthStar Node of the Clinical Trials Network In CTN-0076-Ot (Clinical Decision Support for Opioid Use Disorders in Medical Settings: Pilot Usability Testing in an EMR (COMPUTE)), our team iteratively developed and piloted a web-based and electronic health record (EHR)-integrated Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) Clinical Decision Support (CDS) system to offer expert guidance to primary care providers (PCPs) on the diagnosis and management of OUD. The OUD-CDS, referred to as Opioid Wizard, was implemented within the EPIC EHR of one large care system and piloted with 55 providers to ensure content validity and provider satisfaction. Through CTN-0095 (COMPUTE 2.0), our team will now implement Opioid Wizard in a large multi-site clinic-randomized controlled trial to evaluate its impact on practice process measures and patient outcomes. We also aim to prepare for scalability (i.e., integration into usual primary care practice after the study is complete) and dissemination by evaluating facilitators and barriers to implementation, determining the costs of implementation and maintenance, and assessing the short-term cost impacts of Opioid Wizard.  The study will include three large diverse care systems and randomize a minimum of 30 clinics to receive Opioid Wizard or usual care (UC). In intervention clinics, Opioid Wizard will identify patients who are at high risk` for OUD or diagnosed with OUD; use data stored in the EHR for each eligible patient to assemble treatment recommendations tailored to each patient’s current needs; display these recommendations to PCPs via the Opioid Wizard user interface; and store analytic data from all targeted visits. In UC clinics, Opioid Wizard will run invisibly in the background to identify high-risk or OUD patients, assemble treatment recommendations tailored to each eligible patient’s needs, and store analytic data from all targeted visits. This study is part of the NIH’s Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative to speed scientific solutions to the national opioid public health crisis. The NIH HEAL Initiative bolsters research across NIH to improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction. There is a nearly 80% treatment gap in the use of medications to treat opioid use disorder (MOUD). Conducting a large-scale trial of Opioid Wizard, an opioid use disorder clinical decision support system for primary care settings, has great potential to increase access to MOUD, and could help reduce the nearly $20 billion in annual healthcare costs related to untreated opioid misuse and OUD.",NorthStar Node of the Clinical Trials Network,10358343,UG1DA040316,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ',

"BRAIN INITIATIVE RESOURCE: DEVELOPMENT OF A HUMAN NEUROELECTROMAGNETIC DATA ARCHIVE AND TOOLS RESOURCE (NEMAR) To take advantage of recent and ongoing advances in intensive and large-scale computational methods, and to preserve the scientific data created by publicly funded research projects, data archives must be created as well as standards for specifying, identifying, and annotating deposited data. The value of and interest in such archives among researchers can be greatly increased by adding to them an active computational capability and framework of analysis and search tools that support further analysis as well as larger scale meta-analysis and large scale data mining. The OpenNeuro.org archive, begun as a repository for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, is such an archive. We propose to build a gateway to OpenNeuro for human electrophysiology data (EEG and MEG, as well as intracranial data recorded from clinical patients to plan brain surgeries or other therapies) – herein we refer to these modalities as neuroelectromagnetic (NEM) data. The Neuroelectromagnetic Data Archive and Tools Resource (NEMAR) at the San Diego Supercomputer Center will act as a gateway to OpenNeuro for NEM data research. Such data uploaded to NEMAR at SDSC will be deposited in the OpenNeuro archive. Still- private NEM data in OpenNeuro will, on user request, be copied to the NEMAR gateway for further user processing using the XSEDE high-performance resources at SDSC in conjunction with The Neuroscience Gateway (nsgportal.org), a freely available and easy to use portal to use of high-performance computing resources for neuroscience research. Publicly available OpenNeuro NEM data will be able to be analyzed by running verified analysis applications on the OpenNeuro system. In this project we will build an application to evaluate the quality of uploaded NEM data, and another to visualize the data, for EEG and MEG at both the scalp and brain source levels, including time-domain and frequency-domain dynamics time locked to sets of experimental events learned from the BIDS- and HED-formatted data annotations. The NEMAR gateway will take a major step toward applying machine learning methods to a large store of carefully collected and stored human electrophysiologic brain data to spur new developments in basic and clinical brain research. The NEMAR gateway to the OpenNeuro.org human neuroimaging data archive will build tools to add human electrical and magnetic brain activity records to the archive, to evaluate its quality for users and visualize its features. The resulting facility will allow applications of new machine learning methods to research on human brain dynamics that can be expected to lead to breakthroughs in understanding how the human brain supports our awareness and behavior in both health and disease.",BRAIN INITIATIVE RESOURCE: DEVELOPMENT OF A HUMAN NEUROELECTROMAGNETIC DATA ARCHIVE AND TOOLS RESOURCE (NEMAR),10228674,R24MH120037,"['Archives ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Libraries ', ' Magnetoencephalography ', ' MEG imaging ', ' magnetoencephalographic imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Mining ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Patients ', ' Privatization ', ' Quality Control ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Running ', ' Scalp structure ', ' Scalp ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' brain surgery ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Evaluation ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' data quality ', ' Data Storage and Retrieval ', ' data retrieval ', ' data storage ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Descriptor ', ' Spottings ', ' Staging ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' tool ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' magnetic ', ' Magnetism ', ' Performance ', ' supercomputer ', ' high-end computing ', ' High Performance Computing ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Modality ', ' response ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Magnetic Resonance ', ' Documentation ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resource Development ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' web services ', ' web-based service ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' cyber infrastructure ', ' cyberinfrastructure ', ' Visualization software ', ' visualization tool ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' data structure ', ' web interface ', ' brain research ', ' tool development ', ' data format ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' cloud computer ', ' BRAIN initiative ', ' Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies initiative ', ' built environment ', ' support tools ', ' hackathon ', ' hack day ', ' hackfest ', ' data archive ', ' data library ', ' preservation ', ' data submission ', ' data deposition ', ' Infrastructure ', ' computational platform ', ' computing platform ', ' data tools ', ' data analysis pipeline ', ' data processing pipeline ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' data curation ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' archive data ', ' archiving data ', ' Data Store ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R24,2021,905255,CA-52
"Quantifying the Metrics of Surgical Mastery: An Exploration in Data Science PROJECT SUMMARY In surgery, it is accepted that there may be a ten to twenty-year learning curve to reach mastery for certain procedures. We believe this timeline can and should be shortened to improve patient care. Our short-term goal is to make a major contribution to the emerging field of Surgical Data Science by building a database of mastery level surgical performance and generating a roadmap for multimodal data collection and analysis procedures. Sharing our process, procedures and results broadly, will help to change measurement culture in healthcare. Through our newly developed partnership (October 2019) with the American College of Surgeons, we have already experienced early success in starting the conversation through the “Surgical Metrics Project” (https://www.facs.org/education/surgical-metrics). Using a standardized data collection platform (a mastery-level hernia simulation), we will deploy and synchronize multiple data capture approaches (motion tracking, video, audio and validated surgical performance checklists) to build our database. Data analysis will quantify surgical mastery and consist of new applications and discoveries in machine learning. Hypothesis: Using multiple, synchronized data capture approaches and machine learning, it is possible to create a database of mastery level surgical strategies that can be translated into a value-added, surgical navigation tool for surgeons. To test this hypothesis, we will empirically investigate the following paraphrased aims: SPECIFIC AIM 1: Quantify surgical mastery (cognitive and technical) during a simulated laparoscopic ventral hernia (LVH) repair by using a post-procedure analysis of multi-modal performance metrics captured from hospital credentialed surgeons (N~125). SPECIFIC AIM 2: Establish validity evidence for surgical mastery metrics by comparing simulation-based LVH performance with operating room LVH performance from the same surgeons (N~60). SPECIFIC AIM 3: Empirically investigate the best implementation strategy for utilization of a surgical navigation tool designed to deliver value-added information regarding mastery-level surgical performance strategies to a new group of hospital credentialed surgeons (N~125). PROJECT NARRATIVE The significance of this study is the opportunity to make a major contribution to the emerging field of Surgical Data Science by: 1) Generating a large multimodal dataset that can be de-identified and shared and 2) Providing a roadmap for predicting and supporting operative mastery with an artificial intelligence powered decision tool.",Quantifying the Metrics of Surgical Mastery: An Exploration in Data Science,10227195,R01DK123445,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Credentialing ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Decision Making ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Feedback ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Hernia ', ' Ventral Hernia ', ' Hospitals ', ' Learning ', ' Motion ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Operating Rooms ', ' Physicians ', ' Research ', ' Surgical Specialties ', ' Surgical Profession ', ' surgery specialty ', ' Students ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Video Recording ', ' Videorecording ', ' video recording system ', ' Work ', ' Technical Expertise ', ' technical skills ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' TimeLine ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' repaired ', ' repair ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' magnetic ', ' Magnetism ', ' Surgeon ', ' early experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Address ', ' Feeds ', ' Data ', ' American College of Surgeons ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' skill acquisition ', ' skill development ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' clinical practice ', ' data sharing ', ' cognitive skill ', ' Data Science ', ' implementation strategy ', ' strategies for implementation ', ' multimodal data ', ' multi-modal data ', ' multi-modal datasets ', ' multimodal datasets ', ' motion sensor ', ' data framework ', ' data standards ', ' data standardization ', ' force sensor ', ' ']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,670975,CA-18
"Development of assistive self-care robot technologies for people with disabilities Towards Autonomy in Daily Living: A Formalism for Intelligent Assistive Feeding Systems  Applicant PI, Tapomayukh Bhattacharjee Overview We propose to develop a design space framework and co-design methodology for the development of assistive self-care robot technologies that are informed by the social model of disability. Our model of assistive robots in the domain of self-care considers an individual's social and environmental context, coping processes and other factors that can affect independent functioning. Our design methods utilize embedded sensing to intelligently respond to these con- siderations. We speciﬁcally focus on assistive feeding tasks, proposing a formalism that enables a robotic system to feed a person with upper-extremity disability. Our guiding principle is that human-level interaction is feasible only if the robot itself relies on human-level semantics. We im- plement this principle by relying on data to learn and develop object-dependent control policies and timing models for acquiring and transferring a bite to a user at a proper time. The system's ob- server detects world states and arbitrator invokes different control policies based on these states. The tangible result will be an intelligent assistive feeding robot whose performance can generalize to different activities, adapt to user preferences, and recover from failures. Objectives and Relevance to NIH A design framework for assistive robots would provide for- malisms that let us address the fundamental challenge of designing robots that are responsive to context of use and support assisted self-care in a variety of social settings. We combine method- ologies from human-robot interaction, cognitive science, machine learning, robotics and haptics with user studies and our formalism to address the following research questions: (Q1) Mechanics of Feeding-Control Policies: How can control policies be designed for dexterous non-prehensile manipu- lation of deformable objects such as food? (Q2) Social Aspects of Feeding-Bite Timing: How should an assistive feeding robot decide the right timing for feeding a user? (Q3) Human-in-the-Loop: How can human-directed feedback be added into the loop for an autonomous assistive feeding system?  The proposed work will allow users with upper-arm disabilities to use this system for intelli- gent assistance with daily feeding tasks. This can in turn help them increase their independence and autonomy making eating easier and more enjoyable. While we presently focus on this spe- ciﬁc application, the tools and insights we gain can generalize to the ﬁelds of robotic assistance and human-robot interaction across other activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living. Thus, our work is clearly motivated by the intent to improve the quality of health and life of the aging population and is very relevant to the theme of NIH. 1 Towards Autonomy in Daily Living: A Formalism for Intelligent Assistive Feeding Systems  Applicant PI, Tapomayukh Bhattacharjee  The proposed work will allow users with upper-arm disabilities to use this system for intelli- gent assistance with daily feeding tasks, potentially increasing their independence and autonomy making eating easier and more enjoyable. The long-term promise of this research is to have robots in society that are able to seamlessly and ﬂuently perform complex manipulation tasks in dynamic human environments in real homes which could impact individuals with other disabilities as well as able-bodied individuals. Through improved access to independent living and customizing to the unique needs and preferences of users, the results of this project can positively impact mil- lions of people worldwide, especially given the vast variability in our target population by being transformational in the scalability of assistive robotics for self-care. 1",Development of assistive self-care robot technologies for people with disabilities,10232054,F32HD101192,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Bite ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Communities ', ' Cues ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Sterile coverings ', ' Dressing ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Environment ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Handicapped ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' disabled ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled people ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Independent Living ', ' Intelligence ', ' Learning ', ' Panthera leo ', ' Lions ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Parents ', ' Play ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Robotics ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Semantics ', ' Societies ', ' Target Populations ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tweens ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Taxonomy ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Bathing ', ' Baths ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' improved ', ' disability ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Robot ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cognitive psychology ', ' Cognitive Science ', ' Life ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Complex ', ' Upper arm ', ' System ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' social model ', ' intergenerational ', ' kinematic model ', ' kinematics ', ' peer ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' care giver stress ', ' caregiver stress ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' Membrum superius ', ' Upper Limb ', ' Upper Extremity ', ' IADL ', ' instrumental activity of daily living ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' feeding ', ' robot assistance ', ' robot assisted ', ' robotic assistance ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' haptics ', ' aging population ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' care recipients ', ' care receiver ', ' human-robot interaction ', ' human-in-the-loop ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' robotic system ', ' assistive robot ', ' Home ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,F32,2021,68562,WA-07
"Improving Hypertension Treatment in African Americans Using Computational Modeling and Predictive Analytics ABSTRACT As compared to whites, African Americans (AA) develop hypertension (HTN) at an earlier age, have a greater frequency and severity of HTN, poorer control of blood pressure (BP), and have twice the mortality rate from HTN. For 47 years our department has been developing computer simulations of integrative physiology for research purposes. The current model, HumMod, is comprised of 14 organ systems, and includes neural, endocrine, circulatory, and renal physiology. We have created tools that generate and analyze large cohorts of computer-generated (virtual) patients. With these techniques HumMod has been used for hypothesis generation and for understanding underlying physiological mechanisms that are not able to be determined in either whole animal or human experiments. This proposed work will use these tools and this mathematical model of human physiology to develop a realistic AA virtual population for studying antihypertensive therapies that have well-known (diuretic or salt reduction), variable (angiotensin converting enzyme, or ACE inhibition), or unclear (renal denervation (RDX), and baroreflex activation therapy (BAT) therapeutic efficacies in AA. Published data from our laboratory show that our model is robust and can realistically simulate salt sensitivity, multiple types of HTN, and device-based antihypertensive therapy. As shown in our preliminary data, we have successfully created a virtual population that was similar to the clinical data (AA population with resistant HTN) in 5-dimensions (blood pressure, heart rate, glomerular filtration rate, cardiac output, and peripheral resistance) and have conducted in silico trials for new device-based therapy currently being evaluated for the treatment of resistant HTN—namely RDX, BAT, and arteriovenous fistula. Based on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that these techniques will allow us to investigate the physiological mechanisms responsible for the variation in response to therapy in a wide range of AA patient types and predict the likelihood of success for a particular treatment. Aim 1 of the proposal will test the hypothesis that a virtual AA population with resistant HTN can be successfully calibrated and validated. Aim 2 of the proposal will test the hypothesis that in silico trials using the calibrated populations from the first Aim can be used for testing and predicting mechanisms of nonresponse to device-based antihypertensive therapies. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that our predictive analytic techniques can be used to identify mechanisms and proxy markers of therapeutic resistance in hypertensive AA. These proposed studies have clinical relevance because they address a leading cause of morbidity and mortality as well as potential mechanisms of therapeutic resistance in an underserved and understudied minority. Furthermore, these applications and the potential insights gleaned from our physiological model and predictive analytic tools may have broad implications for BP control in other resistant hypertensive populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE African Americans develop hypertension and its co-morbidities at an earlier age, have a greater frequency and severity of hypertension, have poorer control of blood pressure, and die disproportionately (2-fold) more from hypertension as compared to whites. Despite these known disparities, there has been little attention or advancement in the management of blood pressure in the African American population. Our laboratory’s advanced physiological model paired with novel analytic tools may mechanistically predict the types of patients that should respond to therapy, ultimately improving patient drug regimens and their success rate in this underserved and understudied population.",Improving Hypertension Treatment in African Americans Using Computational Modeling and Predictive Analytics,10268976,K99MD014738,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Aldosterone Antagonists ', ' aldosterone inhibitor ', ' Angiotensin II ', ' AngII ', ' Animals ', ' Antihypertensive Agents ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Agents ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Drugs ', ' Anti-Hypertensives ', ' Antihypertensive Drugs ', ' Antihypertensives ', ' Hypotensive Agent ', ' Hypotensive Drugs ', ' Hypotensives ', ' Arteriovenous fistula ', ' AV fistula ', ' Arteriovenous Aneurysm ', ' Attention ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Calcium Channel ', ' Calcium Channel Antagonist Receptor ', ' Calcium Channel Blocker Receptors ', ' Calcium Ion Channels ', ' VDCC ', ' Voltage-Dependent Calcium Channels ', ' Cardiac Output ', ' heart output ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' computational simulation ', ' computerized simulation ', ' Denervation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Diuretics ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Feedback ', ' Glomerular Filtration Rate ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A ', ' Angiotensin Converting Enzyme ', ' Angiotensin I-Converting Enzyme ', ' CD143 Antigens ', ' Carboxycathepsin ', ' Dipeptidyl Peptidase A ', ' Kininase A ', ' Kininase II ', ' Laboratories ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' Morbidity -

"mHealth-Community Health Worker tool for comprehensive post-cesarean follow-up in rural Rwanda Project Summary/Abstract Increased access to cesarean sections (c-sections) has contributed to the decline of maternal mortality in sub- Saharan Africa (SSA); however, as the rate of c-sections has increased, so has the rate of c-section related complications. While women who deliver vaginally in rural SSA often receive postpartum follow-up care in their homes from community health workers (CHWs), most programs require that women who deliver via c-section return to health centers or hospitals for follow-up because of the increased complexity of their care. Facility- based follow-up can be financially catastrophic and physically burdensome for mothers, leading to delays in care and increased risk for morbidity. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop a safe mobile health (mHealth) tool to support CHW-led home- based follow-up for women delivering via c-section in rural Rwanda at postoperative days (PODs) 5 and 10. In the first R21 phase, we will develop a software library for an existing photo-based surgical site infection (SSI) diagnostic algorithm to run locally on a smartphone (without internet or cell network connection) (Aim 1a). We will work with Insightiv Technologies to develop the comprehensive mHealth-CHW tool, including incorporating the SSI diagnostic algorithm software library and integrating three CHW usability assessments into the design phase (Aim 1b). Finally, we will test the usability and acceptability of the new tool in a group of 30 CHWs (Aim 2). When we achieve 80% usability and acceptability, we will continue to the second phase. The R33 phase of the grant will study the validity of the mHealth-CHW tool for c-section follow-up (Aim 3) by prospectively following 450 women delivering via c-section and implementing the mHealth-CHW tool and follow- up in their homes at PODs 5 and 10. The women will then return to the hospital at POD 16 for a physical examination and we will compare diagnoses and complications identified via the mHealth-CHW tool to those from the physical exam. We will then evaluate the time-to-diagnosis for c-section complications by randomizing 1350 women to follow-up by the mHealth-CHW tool versus standard of care (Aim 4). Finally, we will assess the acceptability of mHealth-CHW follow-up in 40 women who have delivered via c-section through focus group discussions (Aim 5). We will also conduct two research training series, one in quantitative methods and one in qualitative methods, to strengthen our team's ability to lead mHealth research in the future. Project Narrative In this study, we will develop a comprehensive mHealth-community health worker (CHW) tool for cesarean section (c-section) follow-up that is usable and acceptable to CHWs in rural Rwanda. We will then assess the validity of this tool during a prospective pilot, the impact of this tool on time-to-diagnosis in a randomized trial, as well as the acceptability of the tool to mothers delivering via c-section. This research will support the ability of CHWs to provide safe, accessible, and affordable in-home c-section follow-up care to women in rural Africa, thus decreasing the physical and financial burden of facility-based follow-up for new mothers.",mHealth-Community Health Worker tool for comprehensive post-cesarean follow-up in rural Rwanda,10268606,R21HD103052,"['Africa ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Algorithms ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cesarean section ', ' Abdominal Delivery ', ' C section ', ' Cesarean ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' community health worker ', ' Complication ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' care facilities ', ' Hospitals ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Libraries ', ' Maternal Mortality ', ' maternal death ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Mothers ', ' Physical Examination ', ' Medical Inspection ', ' postcesarean section ', ' post cesarean ', ' post cesarean section ', ' postcesarean ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Rwanda ', ' Ruanda ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Surgical Wound Infection ', ' surgical site infection ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Vagina ', ' Vaginal ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' Postpartum ', ' post-partum ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Recovery ', ' Rural ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Country ', ' experience ', ' care seeking ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Health system ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Research Training ', ' Monitor ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Home visitation ', ' House Call ', ' home visit ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' usability ', ' primary outcome ', ' standard of care ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' arm ', ' Algorithmic Software ', ' Algorithmic Tools ', ' Software Algorithm ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' support tools ', ' postpartum care ', ' post-partum care ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' financial burden ', ' financial distress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial stress ', ' cost estimate ', ' cost estimation ', ' implementation fidelity ', ' Home ', ' ']",NICHD,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R21,2021,206303,MA-07
"Access to Genetic Information Leveraging Innovative Technology (AGILITY) Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The AGILITY (Access to Genetic Information Leveraging Innovative TechnologY) trial will assess layered challenges in realizing precision medicine. This includes a limited genetic counseling workforce to facilitate test decisions, and existing inequities in access to genetic testing. To address these challenges, we will conduct a Type1 Hybrid Trial that includes three specific aims. The first aim is to take an existing clinical genetics chatbot and tailor it for use in population screening of gene variants that can lead to Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer syndromes, Lynch Syndrome, and Familial Hypercholesterolemia. Due to the prevalence of the variants and options for taking actions to reduce negative outcomes, 10 genes have been endorsed for population screening by the National Academy of Medicine and the American College of Medical Genetics. To validate the chatbot for the target population, we will use data from interviews with primary care patients and providers to learn the informational needs to achieve informed test decisions. Once the chatbot is validated, the second aim is to conduct a virtually-implemented randomized controlled trial with primary care patients from a variety of backgrounds. We will test non-inferiority of the chatbot in comparison to standard genetic counseling. We plan to enroll 2,400 adult participants from five racially, ethnically and socioeconomically diverse primary care clinics at the University of Florida Health System. Patients will be eligible to enroll in the trial if they have no higher risks for the screening conditions. [Those with higher risks will be offered the opportunity to undergo targeted genetic testing as is standard of care, and followed as a descriptive study arm.] Participants will be randomized to learn about testing via a clinical chatbot or a genetic counselor. Our primary outcome is informed choice about undergoing genetic testing. As such, those who decline testing are as informative as those who accept. Secondary outcomes include test-related distress, decisional conflict, and testing uptake. Informed choice will be assessed immediately following the decision, after receipt of results for those who accept testing, and 3 and 6 months later for all participants. To ensure success of the AGILITY Trial, investigators at RTI International will work with the Senior Associate Dean of Research, primary care providers, patients and the community advisory board at the University of Florida Health System to develop recruitment, engagement, and retention strategies. The third aim is to conduct an implementation assessment of the clinical chatbot as an intervention to optimize genetic counseling without compromising informed decision-making and to facilitate population screening. To do so, we will analyze interviews with participants, genetic counselors, and primary care providers participating in the trial, using recognized approaches to inform implementation. The AGILITY study will provide evidence in support of workable solutions to address the critical issue of how to provide robust and scalable genetic counseling around predictive genomics in routine clinical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE More efficient ways for people to make decisions about having genetic testing are needed. We will compare use of a chatbot to standard genetic counseling in helping healthy adults in a primary care setting make informed choices. If similar, this intervention can expand access to genetic testing to achieve greater equity.",Access to Genetic Information Leveraging Innovative Technology (AGILITY)

"Advancing SUDEP risk prediction using a multicenter case-control approach Project Summary Patients with epilepsy have a 25-fold elevated risk of sudden death. Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) is the most common disease-related cause of premature mortality in people with seizure disorders, affecting 1 of every 1000 patients annually. Despite this, mechanisms and risk factors of SUDEP remain largely unknown. Having ongoing generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) and no nocturnal supervision are the only definite risk factors, and reducing seizures is the only currently available preventive strategy. Several other clinical factors and potential biomarkers such as prolonged post-ictal generalized EEG suppression (PGES) that follows GTCS, abnormal inter-ictal ECG, and structural brain MRI abnormalities were associated with increased SUDEP risk, but none were rigorously confirmed in a large case-control study. While limitations of single-center studies in accumulating a sufficient number of cases are well recognized, prospective multicenter studies are also severely limited by the time, expense, and loss of follow-up constraining sample size and power. To sidestep these limitations, we propose a retrospective multisite case-control study that will screen >40,000 patients from 86 epilepsy monitoring centers worldwide, with a conservative expected total of >185 SUDEP cases and 370 age/sex-matched controls. Employing our comprehensive approaches to identify SUDEP cases combined with novel data harmonization techniques will allow us to: 1) provide an unprecedentedly large curated dataset of SUDEP, 2) identify clinical, electrophysiological, and imaging predictors of SUDEP using advanced machine learning methods, and 3) develop an individualized model to predict SUDEP risk that can be used in clinic. The proposed study will test the hypothesis that SUDEP cases exhibit different electroclinical and imaging characteristics that can provide an individualized prediction model. We will identify ictal electroclinical and interictal electrophysiological and neuroimaging biomarkers of SUDEP. We will compare markers of seizure severity between SUDEP cases and age/sex-matched living epilepsy patients, including decerebrate or decorticate posturing during GTCS, PGES duration, postictal bradycardia + asystole and post-convulsive central apnea. Additionally, we will assess putative interictal biomarkers including decreased low frequency power in ECG heart rate variability and decreased MRI-derived volumes in the right hippocampus/amygdala and brainstem. We will also employ machine-learning techniques to uncover novel biomarkers from interictal electrophysiological data. Finally, using a Bayesian framework, we will develop an individualized SUDEP risk prediction tool that combines clinical features with measures derived from routine EEG, ECG, and MRI. Our goal is to create a SUDEP case-control dataset to identify clinical risk factors and biomarkers that will help to create a robust model of an individual’s SUDEP risk based on measures derived from routine clinical care and testing such as interictal ECG, MRI and EEG. Such a tool could transform clinical practice, facilitate trials of SUDEP interventions, and ultimately save lives. Project Narrative One in 1000 people with epilepsy die every year due to Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). Identifying risk factors associated with SUDEP remains challenging due to the lack of large controlled datasets enabling rigorous analyses and development of comprehensive prediction models. Our study will address this critical unmet need by screening records of >40,000 patients from >85 epilepsy centers worldwide to obtain a nearly order of magnitude more cases and controls than any prior study, and applying innovative methods to test candidate biomarkers, leading to better understanding of SUDEP mechanisms and developing individualized risk models to better target patients for counseling and interventions.",Advancing SUDEP risk prediction using a multicenter case-control approach,10290017,R01NS123928,"['Affect ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Stem ', ' Brainstem ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Counseling ', ' Data Collection ', ' Sudden Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' ECG ', ' EKG ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Heart Arrest ', ' Asystole ', ' Cardiac Arrest ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Posture ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Scalp structure ', ' Scalp ', ' Seizures ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' awake ', ' Individual ', ' Premature Mortality ', ' Sample Size ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Bradycardia ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' grand mal seizure ', ' Tonic -

"Aligning Patient Acuity with Intensity of Care after Surgery ABSTRACT A key aim of this proposal is to equip the candidate with the training and resources necessary to develop expertise and experience in large-scale, multi-institutional informatics research using electronic health record data and machine learning to develop clinical decision-support tools. This proposal builds toward the candidate’s long-term career goal of becoming an independent surgeon-scientist with expertise in design and implementation of machine learning systems to augment clinical decision-making. To accomplish this goal, the candidate and mentors propose a systematic investigation of postoperative ‘patient acuity’ (i.e., risk for critical illness and death) and ‘intensity of care’ (i.e., triage destination and frequency of vital sign and laboratory measurements). After major surgery, misaligned patient acuity and intensity of care can lead to preventable harm and inappropriate resource use, affecting approximately 15 million inpatient surgeries annually in the US alone. When high-acuity patients receive low-intensity care, postoperative complications can progress to critical illness and cardiac arrest. Providing high-intensity care to low-acuity patients has low value and may cause harm through unnecessary treatments. It is difficult to address these problems systematically because there is no validated, unifying ‘intensity of care’ definition. The overall objective of this application is to understand intensity of care decision spaces in surgical patients and match them to clinical phenotypes and outcomes, leveraging this knowledge to generate precise, autonomous decision-support tools. The central hypothesis of this application is that inappropriate postoperative intensity of care is common, predictable, and associated with increased short- and long-term mortality, morbidity, and hospital costs. The rationale for this work is that integrating electronic health record data, machine learning, and clinical domain expertise offers opportunities to understand postoperative intensity of care decisions and develop decision-support tools capable of optimizing clinical outcomes and resource use. The specific aims of this proposal are to (1) develop and validate postoperative intensity of care definitions, (2) develop and validate interpretable, actionable acuity assessments that elucidate decision spaces, and (3) identify and predict postoperative intensity of care phenotypes. The proposed research is significant because it addresses a problem that affects millions of patients annually and is associated with potentially preventable harm and suboptimal resource use. The approach is innovative because the candidate and mentors are unaware of any prior attempts to classify and adjudicate postoperative intensity of care and understand the phenotypes and characteristics of patients receiving insufficient or excessive care. During the award period, the candidate will apply for an NIH-R01 investigator-initiated award for the prospective clinical implementation of an interpretable, actionable decision support tool incorporating validated intensity of care definitions and knowledge garnered from phenotype clustering, initially in a silent data collection period followed by a live period during which clinicians are provided with model outputs and clinically actionable recommendations. NARRATIVE After major surgery, misaligned patient acuity (i.e., risk for critical illness and death) and intensity of care (i.e., triage destination and frequency of vital sign and laboratory test monitoring) can lead to preventable harm and inappropriate resource use. It is difficult to address these problems systematically because there is no validated, unifying definition of intensity of care.

"Stakeholder Guidance to Anticipate and Address Ethical Challenges in Applications of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Algorithmic Medicine: a Novel Empirical Approach PROJECT ABSTRACT The potential for artificial intelligence applications, specifically machine learning, to prevent, predict, and help manage disease sparks immense hope not only for the individuals affected, but also for the overall health of populations. Particularly exciting examples of these novel computing strategies are increasingly found in the development of deep learning algorithms for medical use. Already embedded in our daily lives, algorithms have begun to impact human-decision making, from recruitment and hiring of employees to criminal sentencing. Outside of medicine, recognition of the ways algorithms may reflect, reproduce, and perpetuate bias has led to an explosion of theoretical and empirical research on the subject. There is an increasing awareness of potential algorithmic weaknesses, including some that raise concerns about fundamental issues of fairness, justice, and bias. The need to anticipate and address emerging ethical issues in algorithmic medicine is time- sensitive. As health care systems increasingly utilize algorithms for patient identification, diagnosis, and treatment direction, the consequences of algorithmic bias yield real and significant costs. Numerous stakeholders are responsible for the development, application and interpretation of algorithms in medicine, and yet there has been very little engagement of stakeholders most affected by these learning systems and tools. The overarching goal of this empirical and hypothesis driven project is to articulate the landscape of ethical concerns and the issues emerging in the context of the development, refinement, and application of machine learning in algorithmic medicine. First, we determine the distinct ethical issues and problems encountered in the development, refinement, and application of machine learning, by querying the perspectives of a diverse array of stakeholders involved—machine learning researchers, clinicians, ethicists, and patients. Using the new insights generated from the first half, we will conduct an evidence-based, information-sharing vignette survey to understand the impact of the contexts of algorithms on the ethically salient perspectives of physicians—those poised to implement such innovation in their own decision-making for the care of patients. Maximizing our established record of expertise in empirical ethics investigations, this sequence of projects leverages access to the exceptional machine learning research conducted at Stanford University, including work by NIH-funded investigators, and provides extensive, systematically collected data on ethical issues encountered and anticipated throughout the development and implementation of algorithms. Finally, the project develops and refines an evidence-informed information-sharing survey for use in better understanding how physicians react to intelligent systems. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Machine learning-driven algorithmic medicine now faces an urgent need to anticipate and address emerging ethical issues. For machine learning applications in algorithmic medicine, the failure to examine ethical issues from the perspective of stakeholders will inevitably limit the ecological validity and utility of the algorithms and threaten society's future embrace of these innovations. A hypothesis-driven, empirical study is needed to anticipate and address ethical concerns, and provide clinicians, machine learning researchers, policymakers, and the public with evidence to better enable ethical application and translation of algorithms in medicine.",Stakeholder Guidance to Anticipate and Address Ethical Challenges in Applications of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Algorithmic Medicine: a Novel Empirical Approach,10267034,R01TR003505,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disclosure ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Explosion ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Interview ', ' Judgment ', ' Justice ', ' Learning ', ' Medicine ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Societies ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Ethical Issues ', ' Ethicists ', ' Ethics Consultants ', ' court ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Funding ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Empirical Research ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' Employee ', ' Familiarity ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' response ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' population health ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' clinical risk ', ' Algorithm Design ', ' Algorithmic Design ', ' Algorithmic Engineering ', ' algorithm engineering ', ' algorithmic composition ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' recruit ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' stakeholder perspectives ', ' stakeholder insights ', ' ']",NCATS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,442905,CA-18
"Accelerating viral outbreak detection in US cities using mechanistic models, machine learning and diverse geospatial data ABSTRACT Since early January 2020, our interdisciplinary research team has conducted several studies to elucidate the emerging threat of COVID-19 and support public health responses throughout the United States, resulting in peer-reviewed publications, online COVID-19 forecasting tools, and extensive engagement with city, state and national decision makers. In our collaboration with the CDC to develop a national modeling resource for pandemic preparedness, we had recently developed a national model for evaluating multi-layered intervention strategies to contain and mitigate outbreaks in US cities. We adapted the model to COVID-19 by incorporating the latest estimates for age- and risk-group specific rates of transmission, disease progression, asymptomatic infections, and severity (including risks of hospitalization, critical care, ventilation and death). The model is designed to flexibly incorporate combinations of social distancing, contact tracing-isolation, antiviral prophylaxis and treatment, as well as vaccination strategies. Our Supplementary Aims propose to build a more granular and data-driven model of COVID-19 to elucidate the transmission, identify high-risk populations, surveillance targets and effective control of this and future epidemics within US cities. Aim S1: Focusing initially on the Austin-Round Rock metropolitan area in Texas, we will apply these models to improve real-time risk assessments and optimize the timing and extent of layered social distancing measures. Aim S2: We will rapidly evaluate strategies for rolling out antiviral prophylaxis and therapy based on clinical trial data. Aim S3: We will develop user interfaces for our Austin and national models to support both scientific research and public health efforts to mitigate COVID-19 and plan for future pandemic threats. These Aims are synergistic with Specific Aim 2 of our parent grant (R01 AI151176-01), in which we are developing high-resolution models of viral transmission to improve the early detection and control of anomalous respiratory viruses, particularly in at risk populations. NARRATIVE Our Supplementary Aims will accelerate the development of a flexible and granular model of COVID-19 emergence, transmission and control within US cities. Leveraging unprecedented data and a high level engagement with city and state leadership in the Austin-Round Rock MSA and Texas, we will rapidly improve our existing models to evaluate strategies for real-time surveillance and multifaceted interventions including non-pharmaceutical measures (eg, adaptive social distancing and cocooning of high risk populations) as well as future antiviral drugs to mitigate COVID-19. Finally, we will develop user-friendly interfaces for our models to support research and public health decision making for COVID-19 and future pandemic threats.","Accelerating viral outbreak detection

"A Virtual Coach to Enhance Surgical Training using Human-Centric Modeling and Adaptive Haptic Guidance PROJECT SUMMARY We aim to reduce surgical robotic errors by developing novel technology to coach experienced practitioners by using real-time data-driven predictive models of operator behavior, task difﬁculty, and expertise levels during complex surgical training tasks. This technology could increase the effectiveness of simulation-based training, particularly for practicing clinicians, as the predictive models will inform the design of adaptive and personalized feedback for the surgeon.  Surgical training typically involves didactic learning, skills labs, and practice on live patients. Safety concerns asso- ciated with training on patients has led to signiﬁcant developments in simulation-based technology; however, existing simulators may lack the ability promote mastery of skills for practicing providers. Improved training is important for both the provider and the patient. An estimated 100,000 death per year occur due to preventable medical errors. In robotic surgeries, the majority of patient injuries can be attributed to inexperience and lack of technical competence of the attending surgeon. These errors could potentially be avoided through personalized and adaptive coaching.  In general, robotic systems can sense and adapt to their environment, even act autonomously to complete a task. However, the majority of surgical robots used today are “teleoperated systems"". These systems only perform tasks directly commanded by the human operator, possibly with some scaling or tremor cancellation. There is a missed opportunity to leverage the intelligence of robotic systems to sense and interpret the movements of the surgeon and to enable some form of adaptive feedback for personalized coaching. Our prior work in human-centric modeling could hold the key to the technical challenge of integrating intelligent methods into existing surgical robotic training platforms by better understanding the technical strengths and weaknesses of the practicing surgeon in a data-driven manner.  The long-term goal of this project is to improve surgical training outcomes by developing a personalized and adaptive surgical robotic coach capable of providing meaningful feedback to the practicing provider to optimize learning and skill transfer. The speciﬁc aims of the proposal include: (1) evaluate the ability of human- centric models to characterize surgeon performance using motion and video data, (2) design adaptive haptic or visual guidance cues to provide learners with real-time feedback and to optimize learning, and (3) evaluate the effectiveness of the adaptive technology coach through end-user validation using procedural-speciﬁc training models for general surgery, urology, and gynecologic oncology. This project could signiﬁcantly improve provider training in robotic surgery. The project could also improve provider training for laparoscopic and open surgery as the models used to develop the virtual coach are inherently human-centric and not tied to any speciﬁc surgical tasks or surgical platforms.  Our team is uniquely positioned to achieve success in this project, bringing together experts in surgical robotics, human-centric modeling, machine learning, and advanced surgical training. We have conducted extensive preliminary studies in areas related to this proposal, supporting feasibility of this project. Our integration with the Simulation Center at UTSW will enable translation of successful outcomes of this project into the surgical training and retraining pipeline. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Human-generated, preventable errors, particularly those made intra-operatively, can lead to morbidity and mortality for the patient and high costs for the hospital. While simple inanimate trainers have been successfully developed for surgical resident education, there is a lack of simulation-based technology for practicing surgeons. This research leverages novel data-driven methods to quantify how, and how well, a surgeon is performing a task for the long-term goal of developing personalized, adaptive virtual coaches for surgical robotic systems, resulting in better patient outcomes.",A Virtual Coach to Enhance Surgical Training using Human-Centric Modeling and Adaptive Haptic Guidance,10265456,R01EB030125,"['Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Credentialing ', ' Cues ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Gynecology ', ' Hand ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Intelligence ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Discipline of obstetrics ', ' Obstetrics ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Robotics ', ' Rotation ', ' Safety ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Standardization ', ' Surgical Error ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Tremor ', ' United States ', ' Urinary Diversion ', ' Urology ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' Competence ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Hospitalization cost ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Intuition ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Bilateral ', ' Shapes ', ' Robot ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Medical Mistakes ', ' Medical Errors ', ' Tactile ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' preference ', ' Medical center ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' visual feedback ', ' kinematic model ', ' kinematics ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Devices ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' virtual reality ', ' Surgical Models ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Gynecologic Oncology ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Funding Mechanisms ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Tissue Model ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' haptics ', ' emotional factor ', ' public health relevance ', ' robotic training ', ' Transferable Skills ', ' Learning Skill ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' recruit ', ' human model ', ' model of human ', ' robotic system ', ' haptic feedback ', ' virtual coach ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' ']",NIBIB,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2021,308003,TX-10
"Swift.ai: research and development of an integrated platform for machine-assisted research synthesis Project Abstract (30 lines of text)  1 Systematic review and evidence mapping, both forms of research synthesis, are formal, sequential processes  2 for identifying, assessing, and integrating the primary scientific literature. These approaches, already  3 cornerstones of evidence-based medicine, have recently gained significant popularity in several other  4 disciplines including environmental, agricultural, and public health research and are increasingly utilized for  5 informed decision making by governmental organizations. It has been estimated that more than 25,000  6 systematic reviews are conducted and published annually and selecting studies for inclusion is one of the most  7 resource intensive steps for any systematic review or evidence map. In Phase I of our research plan, we have  8 developed a web-based, collaborative systematic review web application called SWIFT-Active Screener, an  9 innovative document screening tool that allows users to identify the majority of relevant articles after screening 10 only a fraction of the total number of abstracts. Our goal for the current proposal is to conduct additional 11 research and development required to make SWIFT-Active Screener a commercial success, while also 12 building on and leveraging methods and software we have previously built to address other stages in the 13 systematic review pipeline. Therefore, one of the primary aims of our ongoing research and development is to 14 address this need by expanding the Active Screener application into an integrated platform for research 15 synthesis by uniting it with several of our other related software products. The resulting platform, which we call 16 “swift.ai,” is described in detail in “Aim 1 – Software engineering to create a unified platform for research 17 synthesis.” In “Aim 2 – Improved statistical methods for Active Screener 2.0”, we expand on the methodological 18 research completed during Phase I of this SBIR, to further develop and refine our methods. Specifically, we 19 investigate new ways to integrate state-of-the art methods in deep learning and new ways to better utilize the 20 large amounts of screening data collected from our users in order to improve our models. Finally, in “Aim 3 – 21 Living evidence maps powered by Active Screener 2.0,” we explore new approaches for using machine 22 learning to facilitate evidence mapping. Project narrative Systematic review is a formal process used widely in evidence-based medicine and environmental health research to identify, assess, and integrate the primary scientific literature with the goal of answering a specific, targeted question in pursuit of the current scientific consensus. By conducting research and development to build a unified, web-based, collaborative, systematic review software application that integrates the latest developments in deep-learning, machine learning, natural language processing and artificial intelligence, we will make an important contribution toward ongoing efforts to automate systematic review. These efforts will serve to make systematic reviews both more efficient to produce and less expensive to maintain, a result which will greatly accelerate the process by which scientific consensus is obtained in a variety of medical and health-related disciplines having great public significance.",Swift.ai: research and development of an integrated platform for machine-assisted research synthesis,10259172,R44ES029001,"['Influentials ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Problem Formulations ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Engineering ', ' Computer Software Development ', ' Computer Software Engineering ', ' Testing ', ' Toxicology ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Discipline ', ' Policies ', ' Active Learning ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Review Literature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Evidence Based Medicine ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' success ', ' Speed ', ' simulation ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Update ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' active method ', ' active technique ', ' active treatment ', ' systematic review ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' NIEHS ', ' cost ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' Endocrine disruption ', ' endocrine disrupting ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' user-friendly ', ' evidence base ', ' public health research ', ' data sharing ', ' screening ', ' web app ', ' web application ', ' deep learning ', ' Adoption ', ' Agriculture ', ' agricultural ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Elements ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' ']",NIEHS,"SCIOME, LLC",R44,2021,820314,NC-04
"Predicting Diabetic Retinopathy from Risk Factor Data and Digital Retinal Images African American and Latinx communities nationally and in California not only bear a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 positive cases and deaths but are also not taking part in COVID-19 testing for a wide range of understudied reasons. This can have profound implications in safety net health care settings where vulnerable patients, who are in need of clinical procedures to prevent significant morbidity, are refusing such potentially lifesaving procedures because of fear of COVID-19 testing and/or contracting COVID-19. The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (LACDHS) is the second largest publicly operated county safety net health care system in the United States, serving more than 750,000 patients annually. Timely access to health care in this under-resourced, high-need setting has been an ongoing challenge for its majority Latinx and African American patients. With the current pandemic, COVID-19 testing for patients has become an essential first step in the provision of critical procedural care. However, the range of reasons why patients refuse COVID-19 testing is little understood. To this end, we propose to explore the obstacles to COVID-19 pre-procedural testing and provide COVID-19 specific training to LACDHS Community Health Workers (CHWs) from these same communities to effectively address: a) the primary goal of increasing COVID-19 testing for individual patients, and the secondary goals of b) facilitating needed procedural care in a timely manner for the safety net health system, and c) developing a sustained public health presence in these communities to build trust and preparedness for critical COVID-19 related future needs. Trained CHWs can help to more effectively overcome obstacles to COVID-19 testing, including historical barriers of mistrust, provide COVID-19 health education, help address social determinants of health and help facilitate technological literacy to improve patient access to testing and care in a telehealth environment. The proposal uses a multidisciplinary, mixed-methods approach including unsupervised machine learning and qualitative interviews to systematically explore barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 testing among vulnerable safety net patients. We will then train clinically based, ethnically/linguistically matched CHWs to implement a hypothesis-driven intervention consisting of six group classes and six personalized patient encounters with African American and Latinx safety net patients. This study has the following specific aims: Aim 1- Utilize machine learning methods to assess whether there are characteristics that define African American and Latinx safety-net patients who engage in or refuse COVID-19 testing; Aim 2 - Conduct in-depth interviews with African American and Latinx patients who either declined or accepted COVID testing to explore contextual, behavioral, and attitudinal factors shaping patient circumstances and concerns; Aim 3 - Develop, implement, and pre-test a CHW intervention with the information from Aims 1 and 2, utilizing a randomized control design among African American and Latinx safety net patients to assess the effect of the CHW hypothesis-driven intervention on trust, self-efficacy, and intent to participate in COVID-19 testing. Project Narrative  With the current pandemic, COVID-19 testing for patients has become an essential first step in the provision of critical procedural care. However, the range of reasons why vulnerable patients in safety net health care settings refuse COVID-19 testing is little understood. This grant is an innovative proposal that seeks to (1) bring together machine learning and behavioral methods to understand the reasons why Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (LACDHS) safety net patients who require COVID-19 testing for procedures refuse or accept COVID-19 testing, and (2) utilize the knowledge gleaned to implement a Community Health Worker (CHW)-based intervention, using LACDHS CHWs, that addresses the multilevel obstacles to COVID-19 testing. Insights gained from this research may be of benefit to improve COVID-19 uptake in other similar safety net settings with CHWs and in planning the future uptake of COVID-19 vaccines in such medically underserved settings.",Predicting Diabetic Retinopathy from Risk Factor Data and Digital Retinal Images,10258973,R01LM012309,"['Affect ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' California ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' community health worker ', ' Community Health Services ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diabetic Retinopathy ', ' Environment ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Feedback ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health education ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Services ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Housing ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' literacy ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Marital Status ', ' Medicine ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"CRCNS: US-France Data Sharing Proposal: Lowering the barrier of entry to network neuroscience The field of network neuroscience has developed powerful analysis tools for studying brain networks and holds promise for deepening our understanding of the role played by brain networks in health, disease, development, and cognition. Despite widespread interest, barriers exist that prevent these tools from having broader impact. These include (1) unstandardized practices for sharing and documenting software, (2) long delays from when a method is first introduced to when it becomes publicly available, and (3) gaps in theoretic knowledge and understanding leading to incorrect, delays due to mistakes, and errors in reported results. These barriers ultimately slow the rate of neuroscientific discovery and stall progress in applied domains. To overcome these challenges, we will use open science methods and cloud-computing, to increase the availability of network neuroscience tools. We will use the platform ""brainlife.io"" for sharing these tools, which will be packaged into self-contained, standardized, reproducible Apps, shared with and modified by a community of users, and integrated into existing brainlife.io analysis pipelines. Apps will also be accompanied by links to primary sources, in-depth tutorials, and documentation, and worked-through examples, highlighting their correct usage and offering solutions for mitigating possible pitfalls. In standardizing and packaging network neuroscience tools as Apps, this proposed research will engage a new generation of neuroscientists, providing them powerful new and leading to new discoveries. Second, the proposed research will contribute growing suite of modeling analysis that can be modified to suit specialized purposes. Finally, the Brainlife.io platform will serve as part of the infrastructure supporting neuroscience research. Altogether, these advances will lead to new opportunities in network neuroscience research and further stimulate its growth while increasing synergies with other domains in neuroscience. Structural and functional networks support cognitive processes. Miswiring networks lead to maladaptive behavior and neuropsychicatric disorders. Network neuroscience is a young field that provides a quantitative framework for modeling brain networks. This project will make network neuroscientific tools available to new users via open science and cloud-computing.

"Utility of Predictive Systems to identify Inpatient Diagnostic Errors: The UPSIDE Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  While much research has been conducted on patient safety since the Institute of Medicine published “To Err is Human” in 2000, there is a comparative dearth of research on diagnostic errors in the hospital setting. The broad, long-term objectives of the proposed research is to better understand the incidence, causes, and risk factors for diagnostic errors in the inpatient setting. This work will provide foundational research for the development of interventions to reduce these errors, including predictive tools, targets for intervention, and a methodology for outcome assessment in future trials of interventions. To achieve this overall goal, we will carry out the following specific aims: 1) To determine the incidence of diagnostic errors among patients who die in hospital or are transferred to the ICU two days or more after admission to a general medicine service through a structured, standardized adjudication process of patient records, 2) To combine adjudication data with data from Vizient to determine which specific factors contribute to risks for diagnostic errors, and to use risk estimates to calculate incidence and impact of factors contributing to those errors, and 3)To create machine- learning models that can be used to retrospectively identify patients in whom a diagnostic error was likely to have taken place. The research will involve a retrospective evaluation of 2000 patients admitted to general medicine units at 20 US hospitals participating in a national research collaborative and which also contribute data to a benchmarking and purchasing organization (Vizient). Using the Safer-Diagnosis (Safer-Dx) and Diagnostic Error Evaluation and Research (DEER) taxonomy tools, both adapted for the inpatient setting, adjudicators will review electronic medical record data and determine the presence or absence of diagnostic errors using a rigorous training and continuous review process to ensure reliability across sites, adjudicators, and time. Standard modelling techniques will be used to understand the population-attributable risk of each of the DEER process failure points to diagnostic error as well as the contributions of several patient, provider, and system-level risk factors. Lastly, advanced machine-learning methods will be used to create models that can identify patients in whom diagnostic error occurred, with superior performance to standard approaches such as logistic regression. Together, these approaches will provide a broad and representative picture of the incidence of diagnostic errors among hospitalized patients who have suffered harm, develop models of patient and system-based factors that make a diagnostic error more or less likely, and build advanced, efficient, and scalable tools needed to support future surveillance and improvement programs for a variety of institutions. This research will establish a foundation from which healthcare systems can assess and achieve excellence in diagnosis in the inpatient setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This study seeks to accurately define the incidence of diagnostic errors among patients suffering serious inpatient events in a large network of US hospitals. Without a reliable method for determining the presence of diagnostic errors across many organizations, it is not otherwise possible to understand the incidence, impact, predictors, and underlying causes of these errors, to create and optimize future solutions to reduce diagnostic errors, to directly test the effects of these solutions, or to teach physicians how to avoid diagnostic pitfalls in the future. Our study addresses these issues while being responsive to the RFA’s goals of developing robust estimates of incidence and risk and using approaches that leverage electronic data, and our approach represents a novel application of rigorous outcome adjudication and advanced modeling techniques to the problem of inpatient diagnostic errors.",Utility of Predictive Systems to identify Inpatient Diagnostic Errors: The UPSIDE Study,10254271,R01HS027369,[''],AHRQ,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,496877,CA-12
"Reducing Drug-Related Mortality Using Predictive Analytics: A Randomized, Statewide, Community Intervention Trial PROJECT SUMMARY Overdose deaths have skyrocketed in the United States since 1999. The epidemic has prompted widespread federal and state actions, yet the number of people who die of an overdose continues to increase. In light of the accelerating and rapidly evolving overdose epidemic, new strategies are needed to identify communities most at risk, and to utilize resources more effectively to curb overdose deaths. To address these public health priorities, we will develop a forecasting tool to predict overdose deaths before they occur, and then conduct a randomized, statewide, community-level intervention to evaluate resource targeting based on these predictions. The study will take place in Rhode Island, a state with the 10th highest rate of overdose fatality in 2016. The study has two phases. First, we will develop a predictive analytics model that forecasts future overdose mortality at the neighborhood-level, using publicly available information and data from a multicomponent overdose surveillance system. This tool, called PROVIDENT (Preventing Overdose using Information and Data from the Environment) will be used to predict the likelihood of magnitude of future overdose deaths in every neighborhood across Rhode Island. Next, we will conduct a randomized policy experiment to evaluate whether targeting overdose prevention interventions to neighborhoods at highest risk reduces overdose morbidity and mortality. The state's department of health will receive PROVIDENT model predictions for half of the 39 cities/towns in Rhode Island. Within these cities/town, the health department will work with stakeholders to target overdose prevention interventions to neighborhoods with the highest probability of future overdose deaths. Interventions include efforts to: (1) prevent high-risk prescribing (through academic detailing and other educational efforts); (2) expand access to opioid agonist therapy, including buprenorphine and methadone; (3) increase naloxone distribution (through community and pharmacy-based efforts); and (4) expand street-based peer recovery coaching and referrals. Control cities/town will continue to receive these interventions, but without targeting to specific neighborhoods. Fatal and non-fatal opioid overdose rates in the control cities/towns will be compared to those that received the PROVIDENT model predictions. To achieve these aims, we will leverage a unique partnership between an academic institution and a state's health department, which allows for unprecedented access to and sharing of population-based overdose surveillance data. Our results will improve public health decision-making and inform resource allocation to communities that should be prioritized for evidence-based prevention, treatment, recovery, and overdose rescue services. If found to be effective, the PROVIDENT forecasting model will be disseminated to other states, which could adapt the tool to guide resource allocation and maximize public health impact. In sum, this project is highly responsive to a top research priority of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and directly addresses one of the nation's most challenging public health crises. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objectives of this project are to leverage surveillance data to predict future overdose outbreaks, and to evaluate the impact of a randomized, statewide, community-level intervention trial to target overdose prevention programs to neighborhoods at highest risk of future overdose deaths. This study develops and tests an opioid overdose forecasting tool, which will allow other states to identify and deploy interventions to communities at highest risk of opioid-related death. This results study will significantly improve the allocation of resources to curb the opioid overdose epidemic in the United States.","Reducing Drug-Related Mortality Using Predictive Analytics: A Randomized, Statewide, Community Intervention Trial",10220922,R01DA046620,"['Buprenorphine ', ' Censuses ', ' Cities ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Community Pharmacy ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Emergency medical service ', ' emergency service ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Priorities ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitals ', ' indexing ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Methadone ', ' Adanon ', ' Althose ', ' Dolophine ', ' Methadose ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Naloxone ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Overdose ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Records ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rhode Island ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Recovery ', ' Policies ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Research Priority ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' resource guides ', ' novel ', ' Prevention program ', ' peer ', ' Prevention ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Academic Detailing ', ' Data ', ' Intervention Community Trial ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' intervention for prevention ', ' prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' preventive intervention ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Sum ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Population ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' primary outcome ', ' overdose prevention ', ' overdose death ', ' overdose fatalities ', ' public health priorities ', ' surveillance data ', ' prescription opioid ', ' licit opioid ', ' opiate medication ', ' opioid medication ', ' prescribed opiate ', ' prescribed opioid ', ' prescription opiate ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' opioid use disorder ', ' opiate use disorder ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' opioid policy ', ' opioid guideline ', ' opioid law ', ' opioid legislation ', ' opioid overdose ', ' opiate overdose ', ' opiate related overdose ', ' opioid drug overdose ', ' opioid induced overdose ', ' opioid intoxication ', ' opioid medication overdose ', ' opioid poisoning ', ' opioid related overdose ', ' opioid toxicity ', ' opioid mortality ', ' opiate deaths ', ' opiate mortality ', ' opioid deaths ', ' opioid overdose death ', ' opioid related death ', ' opioid agonist therapy ', ' opioid agonist treatment ', ' referral services ', ' overdose risk ', ' treatment arm ', ' intervention arm ', ' opioid misuse ', ' non-medical opioid use ', ' nonmedical opioid use ', ' opiate misuse ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIDA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,807350,RI-01
"Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients With Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease Abstract: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is associated with impaired leg function, possible limb loss and an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Intermittent claudication (IC) is a classic PAD symptom occurring in 40% of symptomatic patients, and is associated with 5-, and 15-year mortality rates of 30% and 70%, respectively. PAD is a debilitating illness affecting more than 8.5 million Americans of age 40 and older and 202 million people globally. Despite the high prevalence, PAD patients are less likely to receive appropriate treatment for their atherosclerotic risk factors than patients with coronary artery disease. Advances in endovascular therapy have reduced risks associated with intervention, enabling revascularization as a routine procedure in patients with lower extremity ischemia. However, revascularization success rates vary substantially and numerous PAD patients do not improve at 1-year despite technically good revascularization. Previous findings suggest that alterations in the microcirculation due to a paucity of collateralization may contribute to functional impairment in PAD patients. We hypothesize that the change in microvascular perfusion can identify PAD patients who do not improve at 12-months after revascularization. We will utilize contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) to assess skeletal muscle perfusion in PAD patients. The CE-MRI measures will be associated with hemodynamics and symptoms. The early identification of individuals with a likely poor prognosis post intervention could help to improve surgical treatment strategies. We will investigate the association of microvascular perfusion (Aim 1) and measures of arterial hemodynamics (Aim 2) with leg function and PAD symptoms. We will utilize machine learning methodologies to identify predictors of poor leg function and symptoms (Aim 3). Given the high incidence of PAD and the associated high risk of cardiovascular events, it is paramount to identify individuals who are less likely to improve following lower extremity revascularization. The data of this clinical imaging study will provide novel information on the etiology of microvascular blood flow in PAD. Relevance: The proposed research study is of considerable public health importance given that patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) have an increased risk of atherothrombotic cardiovascular events and mortality. The development of improved non-invasive imaging techniques to assess PAD may enable optimized treatment for individuals who are at an increased risk of future cardiovascular events.",Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients With Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease,10219819,R01HL137763,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Ankle ', ' Regio tarsalis ', ' Tarsal Bone ', ' Tarsus ', ' Arteries ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Exercise ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Intermittent Claudication ', "" Charcot's syndrome "", ' Ischemia ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Literature ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Microcirculation ', ' mortality ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Oxygen ', ' O element ', ' O2 element ', ' Partial Pressure ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patents ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Reference Values ', ' Reference Ranges ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Standardization ', ' Time ', ' Toes ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' United States Department of Veterans Affairs ', ' United States Veterans Administration ', ' Veterans Administration ', ' Veterans Affairs ', ' Gender ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Treadmill Tests ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Blood flow ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Measurement ', ' Skeletal Muscle ', ' Voluntary Muscle ', ' Methodists ', ' Methodist Church ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Superficial Femoral Artery ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' skeletal ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' success ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' research study ', ' regional difference ', ' Early identification ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Leg ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Peripheral arterial disease ', ' peripheral artery disease ', ' post intervention ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' two-dimensional ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' high risk ', ' successful intervention ', ' symptomatic improvement ', ' improve symptom ', ' symptom improvement ', ' treatment strategy ', ' non-invasive imaging ', ' noninvasive imaging ', ' contrast enhanced ', ' contrast imaging ', ' treadmill ', ' imaging study ', ' recruit ', ' treatment optimization ', ' therapy optimization ', ' atherosclerosis risk ', ' atherosclerotic risk ', ' Patient imaging ', ' support vector machine ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' limb loss ', ' lost limb ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NHLBI,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2021,496614,PA-10
"Evaluating the impact of e-cigarette social media marketing on e-cigarette use among underage youth. Abstract/Project summary E-cigarettes are a big problem among high school students – with rates of daily use exploding from 12% in 2017 to 28% in 2019. Adolescents are exposed to e-cigarette endorsements from social media influencers who promote these harmful products on behalf of e-cigarette brands as a healthier alternative to conventional cigarettes. This project proposes to comprehensively describe e-cigarette influencer marketing on Instagram (the most widely used platform for e-cigarette influencers) and on other social media platforms popular among U.S. teenagers; to examine associations between exposure to social media marketing and patterns of initiation and change in e-cigarette use; and to explore youth attitudes and ideas related to e-cigarette influencers and e- cigarette prevention campaigns. For Aim 1, we will use innovative, validated deep-learning models - a form of artificial intelligence that automatically discovers patterns in data - to evaluate trends in marketing themes and compliance with federal requirements for warning labels and sponsorship disclosures in e-cigarette promotional images and videos on Instagram, YouTube and TikTok to be collected from 2021 to 2023 (over four million posts, in all). We will use ANOVA tests to examine temporal trends in user engagement with e-cigarette marketing posts and compare the proportion of underaged users among followers of e-cigarette influencers on these platforms over the two-year period. For Aim 2, we will measure the association of exposure to e-cigarette marketing (on Instagram, YouTube, TikTok and Snapchat) with subsequent initiation, escalation or cessation of e-cigarette use among a socioeconomically- and racially-diverse cohort of 5,000 high school students living in urban areas of Southern California via ongoing longitudinal cohort surveys (2021-2023). We will use three waves of survey data in multilevel multinomial logistic regression to measure changes in exposure to- and engagement with e-cigarette marketing on Instagram, YouTube, TikTok and Snapchat; we will use repeated-measures random effects logistic regression models to evaluate the association of exposure to marketing content on these platforms with subsequent changes in e-cigarette use. Ten focus groups among survey participants will complement survey findings and will be analyzed using the Grounded Theory method. Using the social media data, surveys and focus groups, we will also quantify and characterize the level of exposure to- and perception of anti-e-cigarette prevention campaigns on social media. This project will be the first to thoroughly evaluate changes in e-cigarette use habits among youth as a result of exposure to e-cigarette marketing and interaction with e-cigarette influencers on the most popular social media platforms among adolescents. Project Narrative Despite federal regulations, influencers continue to promote e-cigarette products on Instagram and other social media platforms popular among teenagers such as TikTok, YouTube, and Snapchat. This will be the first study to comprehensively evaluate user engagement with e-cigarette influencers, changes in youth e-cigarette use resulting from exposure to- and engagement with e-cigarette marketing content, trends in e-cigarette marketing themes, and compliance with federal regulations for e-cigarette warning labels and sponsorship disclosures. Our findings will allow us to inform regulators about the influence of social media promotional strategies on youth susceptibility to e-cigarettes to help design future public health e-cigarette prevention campaigns that can counter e-cigarette marketing.",Evaluating the impact of e-cigarette social media marketing on e-cigarette use among underage youth.,10218998,R01CA260459,"['Advertising ', ' Analysis of Variance ', ' ANOVA ', ' Variance Analyses ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' California ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Disclosure ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Habits ', ' Influentials ', ' Interview ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Perception ', ' pressure ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States Federal Trade Commission ', ' Federal Trade Commission ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' USFDA ', ' Measures ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' urban area ', ' urban location ', ' urban region ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Period Analysis ', ' Period Analyses ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Exposure to ', ' Frequencies ', ' Pattern ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Radio ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' trend ', ' Teenagers ', ' Teen ', ' teen years ', ' teenage ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' cigarette warning label ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' data sharing ', ' High School Student ', ' Secondary School Student ', ' Secondary Student ', ' Electronic cigarette ', ' e-cig ', ' e-cigarette ', ' ecig ', ' ecigarette ', ' vaping ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' social media ', ' Data Analytics ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Time trend ', ' Temporal trend ', ' Trends over time ', ' secondary analysis ', ' combustible cigarette ', ' conventional cigarette ', ' traditional cigarette ', ' electronic cigarette use ', ' e-cig use ', ' e-cigarette use ', ' ecig use ', ' ecigarette use ', ' deep learning ', ' e-cigarette cessation ', ' e-cig cessation ', ' ecig cessation ', ' quitting e-cigarettes ', ' quitting e-cigs ', ' quitting ecigarettes ', ' quitting ecigs ', ' warning label ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2021,472796,CA-37
"Multimodal monitoring and high-dimensional data for episode prediction in bipolar disorder SUMMARY Bipolar disorder (BD) is a mood disorder with high recurrence and disability rates, high economic burden, and an estimated suicide risk 20 times higher than the general population. While efficacious treatment is available, BD patients spend a large proportion of their life symptomatic. Predicting the onset of episodes is a valuable strategy to decrease suicide and disability rates and to optimize healthcare costs. The overall objective of this (R21) Exploratory/Developmental study is to obtain pilot data to support the feasibility and potential value of a new approach to predict mood episodes in stable adult patients with BD. This proposal aims to develop new data modeling and inference techniques that will enable more tailored clinical signal detection: examining changes within each individual, over time. To do so, we propose integrating multimodal, high-dimensional telemonitoring data, nonlinear techniques and artificial intelligence classification systems. This approach builds on our preliminary work on: (i) nonlinear techniques for the study of mood regulation in BD; (ii) an award-winning simulation using a machine learning technique (Markov Brains) for episode prediction in BD. AIMS: Aim 1 (feasibility): To obtain and integrate multimodal data to perform time-series analysis and to calculate entropy levels in 90 euthymic BD adults. Exploratory Aim 2 (potential value): To use machine learning techniques (Markov Brains) to distinguish participants at higher risk for a depressive or manic relapse based on their time-series and entropy levels (from Aim 1). HYPOTHESES: H1: We will be able to collect enough data in 80% of our participants and to integrate multimodal data to perform time-series analysis and to calculate entropy levels. H2: Markov Brains will identify participants at higher risk for a mood episode based on high (vs. low) auto-correlated time-series and low (vs. high) entropy levels. SIGNIFICANCE: This R21 application challenges more traditional prediction models by conceptualizing inter- and intra-individual variability as a dynamic property of biological systems. By leveraging densely-sampled objective and subjective data, autonomic, clinical and demographic data, this proposal aims to develop inference techniques that will examine changes within each individual, over time, in order to enhance the estimation performance. Ultimately, if we develop the capacity to predict mood episodes, we should be able to prevent them. NARRATIVE The proposed research is clinically relevant as it could develop new data modeling and inference techniques that will enable more tailored clinical signal detection: examining changes within each individual, over time, in order to predict mood changes indicative of an imminent episode of illness in bipolar disorder.

"Markerless Tracking of 3D Posture to Reveal the Sensory Origins of Body Schema The goal of this proposed research is to reveal the sensory origins underlying the body schema representation. Body schema is the brain's internal model of the body's spatial configuration. This internal representation is critical for sensorimotor processing, movement control, and self-awareness, and is continuously updated during movement. Body schema representations are disrupted when somatosensory input is lost. The first step toward discover the neural correlates of body schema is to uncover neural mechanisms that generate body posture representation. We hypothesize that sensory inputs from primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) to the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) are transformed to construct a body posture representation.  To delineate the mechanisms underlying the neural coding of body posture, this project will utilize large- scale monitoring, apply interventional tools, develop new data analysis tools, and integrate new approaches. Our approach is to perform large-scale electrophysiological recording and novel markerless tracking of 3D posture in freely moving mice. To track posture, the first aim is to adapt a markerless tracking pipeline comprised of a deep 3D convolutional neural network to process high-speed videography of mouse behavior from multiple cameras. The second aim is to perform large-scale recording of neurons in S1, S2, and PPC and use advanced computational approaches to determine which postural features best explain the activity of neurons in these cortical areas. Finally, the third aim is to use optogenetic and projection-specific manipulations to address the causal impact of proprioceptive inputs from S1 and S2 on coding of posture in PPC. This research promises to uncover how sensory inputs are involved in generating the body schema representation and guiding behavior.  Extensive training will be required to carry out this project and achieve my goal of earning a tenure-track professor position. The rigorous methodological and intellectual environment in Dr. Fan Wang’s lab and the Duke Neurobiology community will advance my conceptual knowledge and technical skills. I will implement deep learning techniques through training and collaboration with specialists. I will learn new techniques by attending Neuropixel and computational neuroscience courses. Finally, I will develop my professional skills by frequent attendance of seminars, workshops, and meeting with a postdoctoral mentorship committee.  The proposed project will be conducted in the Department of Neurobiology at the Duke University Medical Campus. This interdisciplinary community at Duke will bolster the research and training included in this application through frequent interaction with talented and collaborative faculty, organization of seminars and symposia, numerous opportunities to practice research talks and receive valuable feedback, formation of a personalized postdoctoral mentorship committee, extensive career and professional training, and invaluable support from the postdoctoral association. Project Narrative Body schema, the brain’s internal model of the spatial configuration of its body parts, is normally updated during movement, but can be disrupted following amputation, stroke, or deafferentation. Understanding how neural circuits generate body schema representation in health and disease could pave the way for improvements in surgical practice, stroke recovery therapy, brain-machine interface technology, and prosthetic limb engineering. Furthermore, sustaining an internal model of the body is a key element of awareness of one’s own body and the body of others, so findings on the sensory origins underlying body schema will have implications ranging from sensorimotor processing, motor control, interpersonal representations, and social cognition.",Markerless Tracking of 3D Posture to Reveal the Sensory Origins of Body Schema,10216941,F32MH122995,"['Affect ', ' Amputation ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Elements ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Faculty ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Locomotion ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Posture ', ' Research ', ' Somatosensory Cortex ', ' somesthetic sensory cortex ', ' Vertebral column ', ' Spinal Column ', ' Spine ', ' backbone ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Talents ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Technical Expertise ', ' technical skills ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Experimental Models ', ' Specialist ', ' base ', ' career ', ' computational neuroscience ', ' Label ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Body part ', ' Individual ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Self Perception ', ' Personal awareness ', ' Self image ', ' Self view ', ' self awareness ', ' self knowledge ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Artificial Extremities ', ' Artificial Limbs ', ' prosthetic limb ', ' Limb Prosthesis ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Tactile ', ' Sensory ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' meetings ', ' professor ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Proxy ', ' Speed ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Touch ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch sensation ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' social cognition ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Motor ', ' Research Training ', ' Cognitive ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Deafferentation procedure ', ' Deafferentation ', ' Behavioral ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' stroke recovery ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' brain machine interface ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' somatosensory ', ' research to practice ', ' research into practice ', ' motor control ', ' optogenetics ', ' neural correlate ', ' sensory input ', ' tenure track ', ' tenure process ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' ']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F32,2021,66390,MA-07
"SCH: INT Re-envisioned Chat-assessment for Real-time Investigating of Nursing and Guidance  Two decades have lapsed since the seminal publications of the National Academy of Medicine (formerly the Institute of Medicine), To Err Is Human and Crossing the Quality Chasm, cast a national spotlight on health-care safety and quality, yet US patient outcome indices continue to lag behind those in other industrialized countries. The 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act mandated health-care providers adopt electronic health record (EHR) systems, leading to widespread EHR adoption, albeit primarily for billing purposes rather than research or quality improvement efforts. Thus EHR impact on health-care quality has tended to be in the domains of physician efficiency and guideline compliance. Despite a large body of evidence that nursing quality is directly related to patient outcomes in the acute care selling, nurses often lack timely information to use in improving individual patient outcomes, and indices of outcomes across patient populations are slow to budge over lime. Widespread adoption of EHRs in U.S. hospitals now allows determination of outcome quality indicators for all patients in a hospital for real-time feedback to nurses. Quality indicators are often only determined by piecing together other information to determine occurrence of an incident, e.g., exhuming information buried in nursing notes. The goal is to develop Chart-assessment for Real-lime Investigation of Nursing and Guidance (CARING), an automated machine learning system to report and predict nursing quality indicators in real-time for hospitalized patients to assist nurses in care planning. CARI NG will reflect algorithmic innovations to mine sequential patterns from multi-sourced, heterogeneous data including nursing narratives, yielding robust predictive models that are insensitive to uncertain labels and evolve with changes in health-care practices. CARING will represent EHR data using inter-connected tensors, capturing higher-order relations, temporal weighting, i.e., more recent data receives more weight, and incorporating domain expert feedback in development. Although CARING will be developed initially for the ten hospitals of our industry partner Emory Healthcare, its flexible refinement will enable adaptation at other health-care institutions. Outcomes of this project will give nurses actionable data in real time to improve nursing care quality that they do not receive now. Moreover, this system can be implemented into the health information infrastructure at an institutional level, integrating multi-scale and multi-level clinical, contextual, and organizational data surrounding each patient for real-time reporting and incorporation into predictive models. CARING supports the National Library of Medicine mission 1) by creating an innovative open source suite of tools for advancing patient safety; and 2) through educational efforts: training graduate students and fellows, and developing a Massive Open Online Course (MOOG), ""Big Data Analytics for Nursing,"" covering topics at the confluence of computer science, nursing, and patient outcome quality indicators.

"An Integrated Software Platform for Accelerating Image-Driven Ophthalmic Research and Driving New Insights and Endpoints to the Clinic ABSTRACT More than 20 million patients suffer from age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, or glaucoma. These degenerative eye diseases develop over decades, and their prevalence is increasing. Retinal imaging technologies such as optical coherence tomography and adaptive optics ophthalmoscopy are essential tools in the investigation and management of eye disease. New quantitative biomarkers derived from these and other imaging modalities are critical to the clinical translation of emerging ophthalmic innovations. However, biomarker development in the era of artificial intelligence requires large volumes of annotated images and transparent, reproducible processes, which places new demands on the management of living subjects research, data sharing, and algorithm development. Unfortunately, current software platforms are not effective in integrating these data in a manner that meets specific requirements in ophthalmology, Our goal in this Direct-to-Phase II SBIR, consistent with objectives of the NIH Strategic Plan for Data Science, is to create an integrated platform (PaaS) for the collection, curation, analysis, and sharing of ocular images and data. We will extend the capabilities of systems developed by the Advanced Ocular Imaging Program (AOIP), Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW), which include: (a) LATTICE - a software solution that reduces costs, reduces errors, and improves communications in the management of living-subjects research; (b) MOSAIC - an image processing platform and algorithm library with traditional and AI-trained algorithms; and (c) The AOIP Image Bank - a Repository that houses images and data on 1578 fully-consent human research subjects. To create the integrative platform, we will address four aims: (a) Extend LATTICE to meet the workflow requirements of academic and sponsored research in local and multisite environments, including the extensible direct integration of data relevant to ocular studies; (b) Design and implement a hybrid (local + cloud) REPOSITORY architecture, data schema, knowledge ontology, and query architecture for Owners and Readers of data.; (c) Integrate and demonstrate LATTICE, REPOSITORY and MOSAIC into a continuous ocular science workflow and (d) integrate and demonstrate Lattice, Repository and Mosaic into a continuous ocular science workflow. Our Integrated Translational Imaging platform will enable ophthalmic innovators to translate sight-saving insights and interventions to the clinic faster, with less frustration, and greater confidence. Our proposal fills an important technology gap in the field of ophthalmic data science and biomarker development. While the number and type of imaging devices continues to grow, the tools to develop and deploy new biomarkers and clinical endpoints using these exquisite imaging devices has not kept pace. With this program we will enable a new generation of image-driven innovation to find its way to the clinic. Project Narrative With more than 20 million patients suffering from age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, or glaucoma, it is crucial to develop non-invasive biomarkers as early predictors of eye disease and reliable tests of the safety and efficacy of new preventative and restorative therapies. To meet the unmet need for rapid access and analysis of ophthalmic research data for the discovery of these biomarkers, we will create an integrated platform (PaaS) for the collection, curation, sharing, and analysis of ocular images and data.

"Objective Quantification of Neural Damage for Screening, Diagnosis and Monitoring of Glaucoma with Fundus Photographs PROJECT SUMMARY Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy and the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. As the disease remains largely asymptomatic until late stages, there is a pressing need to develop affordable approaches for screening before visual impairment occurs. Although sophisticated imaging technologies such as Spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (SDOCT) can provide highly reproducible and accurate quantitative assessment of glaucomatous damage, their application in widespread screening or non-specialized settings is unfeasible, given the high cost and operator requirements. Fundus photography is a low-cost alternative that has been used successfully in teleophthalmology programs. However, subjective human grading of fundus photos for glaucoma is poorly reproducible and highly inaccurate, as gradings tend to largely over- or underestimate damage. We propose a new paradigm for assessing glaucomatous damage by training a deep learning (DL) convolutional neural network to provide quantitative estimates of the amount of neural damage from fundus photographs. In our Machine-to-Machine (M2M) approach, we trained a DL network to analyze fundus photos and predict quantitative measurements of glaucomatous damage provided by SDOCT, such as retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and neuroretinal rim measurements. Our preliminary results showed that the M2M predictions have very high correlation and agreement with the original SDOCT observations. This provides an objective method to quantify neural damage in fundus photos without requiring human graders, which could potentially be used for screening, diagnoses and monitoring in teleophthalmology and non- specialized point-of-care settings. In this proposal, we aim at refining and validating the M2M model in suitable, large datasets from population-based studies, electronic medical records, and clinical trial data. Our central hypothesis is that the M2M approach will be more accurate than subjective human gradings in screening, diagnosing, predicting and detecting longitudinal damage over time. In Aim 1, we will investigate the performance of the M2M model to screen for glaucomatous damage using large datasets from 6 population-based studies: Blue Mountains Eye Study, Los Angeles Latino Eye Study, Tema Eye Survey, Beijing Eye Study, Central India Eye and Medical Study and the Ural Eye and Medical Study, which will provide data on over 25,000 subjects of diverse racial groups. In Aim 2, we will investigate the ability of the M2M model to predict future development of glaucoma in eyes of suspects using the data from the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS). In Aim 3, we will investigate the ability of the M2M model in detecting glaucomatous progression over time using data from the Duke Glaucoma Registry, a large database of longitudinal structure and function data in glaucoma with over 25,000 patients followed over time. If successful, this proposal will lead to a validated, inexpensive, and widely applicable tool for screening, early diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma, that could be applied under population-based settings and also at non-specialized point-of-care settings.

"Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population This application extends a long-running NBER program project on the health and wellbeing of an aging population. Our research plan focuses on better understanding health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and the effective use of health care resources to improve outcomes for an aging population in an evolving landscape. Project 1 (Case and Deaton) explores variations in health trends across geography, race and ethnicity, education, and cohort, identifying and analyzing the life circumstances of those whose health and wellbeing have worsened. Project 2 (Maestas) focuses on the increasing prevalence of pain and opioid use, and their relationship to health outcomes, work, and disability program enrollment. Project 3 (Duflo) analyzes the rapid rise in chronic disease in aging, poorer populations (focusing on India), and the potential role of public policy interventions in improving health in a global context. Project 4 (Baicker and Obermeyer) applies machine learning tools to administrative data to identify overuse (reflecting care with little health benefit relative to its cost or risks) and underuse (reflecting missed opportunities for health benefits) of medical services, focusing on the case of diagnostic testing. Project 5 (Kolstad and Handel) analyzes the impact of information technology in physician treatment decisions, and the potential health benefits of expanded use of IT in health care. Project 6 (Chandra and Sacarny) looks at how information about provider quality affects patients' decisions about their medical care, and whether information on quality improves health care market performance through competition. Project 7 (Baicker and Finkelstein) looks at the effect of public health insurance on health care and outcomes for poor adults, using a randomized controlled design enabled by Oregon's health insurance lottery. Project 8 (Williams) looks at policies that stimulate or impede research and innovation in medicine, and the degree to which the “new uses” problem results in underinvestment in innovations with a potentially positive social value. The program project leverages synergies in methods, data sources, and health issues addressed, building on common themes of health trends and disparities, the role of information for patients and providers, and the potential for different policies to improve health. This research has particular importance in the context of societal changes in demographics, population health, health policy, health care organization, and medicine. The program project will also continue to serve as the organizational foundation for a much larger community of scholars engaged in health-related research at the NBER, attracting some of the most talented scientists from each new generation of economists to the study of health issues. Linking this community to health researchers in other disciplines, particularly in medical and clinical fields, is an important new aim of the program, fostering the cross-disciplinary approaches needed to tackle the most pressing health issues facing an aging population. PROJECT NARRATIVE – PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The goal of the program project is to better understand health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and approaches to improving health in an evolving landscape. It does this through eight component research projects on health and health care, and three cores that coordinate, integrate and leverage the program as a whole. Key themes are understanding recent trends in health and morbility, the disparities in health care and health across the population, the role of patient and provider information, and the potential for different policies to improve health outcomes.",Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population,10224045,P01AG005842,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Foundations ', ' Geography ', ' Glues ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' India ', ' Insurance ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Leadership ', ' Maintenance ', ' Medicine ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Oregon ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Public Policy ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Social Values ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Talents ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Data Security ', ' Data awareness ', ' information security ', ' Decision Aid ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Discipline ', ' Fostering ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Health Care Markets ', ' Healthcare Market ', ' Services ', ' health care organization ', ' healthcare organization ', ' healthcare service organization ', ' health care service organization ', ' Performance ', ' cohesion ', ' synergism ', ' cohort ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Update ', ' trend ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' health economics ', ' Information Technology ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' demographics ', ' aging population ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' public health relevance ', ' population health ', ' improved outcome ', ' opioid use ', ' opiate consumption ', ' opiate drug use ', ' opiate intake ', ' opiate use ', ' opioid consumption ', ' opioid drug use ', ' opioid intake ', ' health care disparity ', ' disparate health care ', ' disparate healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' data access ', ' data archive ', ' data library ', ' Health trends ', ' Wellbeing trends ', ' Wellness trends ', ' well being trends ', ' data resource ', ' care outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' public health insurance ', ' public insurance ', ' randomized controlled design ', ' ']",NIA,NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH,P01,2021,1737917,MA-05
"Optimizing BCI-FIT: Brain Computer Interface - Functional Implementation Toolkit SUMMARY  Many of the estimated four million adults in the U.S. with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) resulting from neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative diseases cannot rely on current assistive technologies (AT) for communication. During a single day, or as their disease progresses, they may transition from one access technology to another due to fatigue, medications, changing physical status, or progressive motor dysfunction. There are currently no clinical or AT solutions that adapt to the multiple, dynamic access needs of these individuals, leaving many people poorly served. This competitive renewal, called BCI-FIT (Brain Computer Interface-Functional Implementation Toolkit) adds to our innovative multidisciplinary translational research conducted over the past 11 years for the advancement of science related to non-invasive BCIs for communication for these clinical populations. BCI-FIT relies on active inference and transfer learning to customize a completely adaptive intent estimation classifier to each user's multiple modality signals in real-time. The BCI-FIT acronym has many implications: our BCI fits to each user's brain signals; to the environment, offering relevant personal language; to the user's internal states, adjusting signals based on drowsiness, medications, physical and cognitive abilities; and to users' learning patterns from BCI introduction to expert use.  Three specific aims are proposed: (1) Develop and evaluate methods for optimizing system and user performance with on-line, robust adaptation of multi-modal signal models. (2) Develop and evaluate methods for efficient user intent inference through active querying. (3) Integrate language interaction and letter/word supplementation as input modalities in real-time BCI use. Four single case experimental research designs will evaluate both user performance and technology performance for functional communication with 35 participants with SSPI in the community, and 30 healthy controls for preliminary testing. The same dependent variables will be tested in all experiments: typing accuracy (correct character selections divided by total character selections), information transfer rate (ITR), typing speed (correct characters/minute), and user experience (UX) questionnaire responses about comfort, workload, and satisfaction. Our goal is to establish individualized recommendations for each user based on a combination of clinical and machine expertise. The clinical expertise plus user feedback added to active sensor fusion and reinforcement learning for intent inference will produce optimized multi-modal BCIs for each end-user that can adjust to short- and long-term fluctuating function. Our research is conducted by four sub-teams who have collaborated successfully to implement translational science: Electrical/computer engineering; Neurophysiology and systems science; Natural language processing; and Clinical rehabilitation. The project is grounded in solid machine learning approaches with models of participatory action research and AAC participation. This project will improve technologies and BCI technical capabilities, demonstrate BCI implementation paradigms and clinical guidelines for people with severe disabilities. PROJECT NARRATIVE The populations of US citizens with severe speech and physical impairments secondary to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily caregiving if they had faster, more reliable means that adapt to their best access methods in communication technologies, as proposed in BCI-FIT.

"Leveraging YouTube Video Analytics for Patient Education: A Digital TherapyTool for Clinicians to Retrieve and Recommend Understandable Videos on Chronic Disease Management Project Summary  The easy availability of huge amount of user generated health information on social networks, blogs, YouTube, Twitter, and hospital review sites presents an unprecedented opportunity to investigate how social media can be a channel to inform and communicate healthcare information to patients and facilitate patient- centric health promotion and literacy improvement. YouTube hosts over 100 million healthcare related videos on a variety of medical conditions. This plethora of user-generated content can be leveraged by patients to improve adherence to clinical guidelines and self-care required for management of chronic diseases. In this project, we propose an augmented intelligence-based approach that effectively combines human input from domain experts and consumers with machine learning and natural language processing methods from computer science to winnow down and retrieve relevant, contextualized video materials that clinicians can recommend to patients. The problem of identifying the most relevant videos from a patient perspective is challenging, but provides an immense innovation space for this approach. We will leverage a co-training machine learning framework and incorporate inputs from patient education assessment tools and clinicians to assess diabetes- related videos on two dimensions: the amount of medical information encoded in the videos and video understandability. We will develop a user-centric patient education video recommender system by integrating these two dimensions with the YouTube video ranking results. Furthermore, we will apply a multi-dimensional evaluation strategy that combines computational evaluations, comparisons with YouTube baseline, and causal analysis methods to understand the performance of the automated methods and the relationship between video understandability and collective user engagement. Finally, we will integrate our computational approach in a modular research prototype technology platform that will accept health related YouTube videos as inputs (generated from patients' keyword searches on diabetes) and produce a ranked list of top 10 retrieved videos for further review by clinicians, and evaluated for barriers and facilitators of the technology usage. Recommending relevant educational materials in video format that leverage user-generated content is one way to deliver personalized and contextualized healthcare information, and resources for self-care management, to patients and consumers. As technology continues to advance and evolve, our methods can be refined further and evaluated via clinical trials to improve patient education, empower patients, caregivers and clinicians, and improve societal health and health literacy. Project Narrative This proposal aims to complement and expand existing approaches for health promotion and health literacy improvement in the population by developing and evaluating automated methods for the easy retrieval of understandable, contextualized patient education videos that clinicians can recommend to their patients from the enormous corpus of user generated content on YouTube. This approach offers the potential for significant impact on patient engagement and empowerment due to its scalability and generalizability. Leveraging advanced machine learning methods for automation combined with social science methods for impact evaluation also allows the incorporation of critical elements for improved patient-physician communication such as transparency, credibility and relevance of the recommended materials.",Leveraging YouTube Video Analytics for Patient Education: A Digital TherapyTool for Clinicians to Retrieve and Recommend Understandable Videos on Chronic Disease Management,10212707,R01LM013443,"['Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Self Management ', ' Social Network ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' programs ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' care delivery ', ' computer science ', ' novel ', ' empowerment ', ' literate ', ' Prevention ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Preventive ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Retrieval ', ' point of care ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' health literacy ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Impact evaluation ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' two-dimensional ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' prototype ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' social media ', ' individual patient ', ' care outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' patient engagement ', ' participant engagement ', ' Twitter ', ' augmented intelligence ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' digital treatment ', ' digital therapeutics ', ' digital therapy ', ' Home ', ' Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Automation ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Information Centers ', ' Interview ', ' Libraries ', ' Literature ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Booklets ', ' Brochures ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Physicians ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' ']",NLM,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,347030,PA-18
"Predicting Relapse at the Time of Diagnosis in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia PROJECT SUMMARY  Relapse is the major cause of cancer related mortality in children with leukemia. Despite improvements in overall survival for children with B-cell progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), for the 600 patients who will relapse each year, half will die of their disease. The high mortality of patients who relapse underscores the need for improved risk prediction and treatment strategies to prevent recurrent leukemia. Current approaches to relapse prediction are limited by insufficient accuracy, delayed prediction and the inability to make actionable treatment adjustments based on prediction information. To address these limitations, we applied a single-cell, high-parameter proteomic approach to ALL patient samples at the time of diagnosis, accurately predicting future relapse based on the presence of pre-B cells with activated signaling. This approach was 38% more accurate than standard of care relapse prediction methods. We propose that identifying relapse-predictive cells in ALL at the time of diagnosis using their distinguishing proteomic and genetic features will result in a clinical risk prediction model that is accurate, immediate, and actionable. This approach to relapse prediction will change the clinical paradigm of relapse risk in ALL to reduce the incidence of relapse itself.  Using large multi-institutional, multimodal cohorts of molecularly and clinically annotated diagnostic patient samples, we will apply deep proteomic approaches to identify surface proteins uniquely expressed on relapse predictive pre-B cells enabling direct identification in a diagnosis sample. We will determine how genomic mutations associate with the presence of relapse predictive cells and examine their genomic mutational burden using single-cell exome sequencing. Finally, building on our data-driven, machine learning approaches, we will construct a diagnostic relapse predictor that is more accurate than standard of care models while informing on leukemia biology and targeted therapeutic options for patients at risk. This will enable a more precise approach to patient classification and treatment, reducing the number of children facing relapse and moving closer to precision medicine for children with ALL. PROJECT NARRATIVE Relapse remains a leading cause of death for patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Using single- cell studies of primary diagnosis samples from patients, we can identify cells responsible for future relapse at the time of diagnosis. Building a model of relapse risk prediction based on the presence of these cells will enable rapid, accurate, and actionable relapse prediction moving closer to the goal of preventing relapse.",Predicting Relapse at the Time of Diagnosis in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia,10210902,R01CA251858,"['Adoption ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' B blood cells ', ' B cell ', ' B cells ', ' B-Cells ', ' B-cell ', ' Biology ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cell Adhesion ', ' Cellular Adhesion ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Immunotherapy ', ' Immune mediated therapy ', ' Immunologically Directed Therapy ', ' immune therapeutic approach ', ' immune therapeutic interventions ', ' immune therapeutic regimens ', ' immune therapeutic strategy ', ' immune therapy ', ' immune-based therapies ', ' immune-based treatments ', ' immuno therapy ', ' Incidence ', ' leukemia ', ' B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' Acute B-Lymphocytic Leukemia ', ' B cell progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia ', ' B-ALL ', ' B-Cell  Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia ', ' B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia ', ' Pre-B-Cell Leukemia ', ' Precursor B Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia ', ' Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' Acute Lymphoid Leukemia ', ' Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' Precursor Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' acute lymphatic leukemia ', ' acute lymphogenous leukemia ', ' acute lymphomatic leukemia ', ' Medicine ', ' Membrane Proteins ', ' Membrane Protein Gene ', ' Membrane-Associated Proteins ', ' Surface Proteins ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Relapse ', ' Risk ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Recurrent disease ', ' Relapsed Disease ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Gene Alteration ', ' Gene Mutation ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Proteomics ', ' immune drugs ', ' immune-based therapeutics ', ' immunologic preparation ', ' immunologic therapeutics ', ' immunotherapeutics ', ' immunotherapy agent ', ' Immunotherapeutic agent ', ' Genomics ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Pediatric Leukemia ', ' children with leukemia ', ' leukemia in children ', ' Childhood Leukemia ', ' SYK ', ' Spleen Tyrosine Kinase ', ' Tyrosine-Protein Kinase SYK ', ' SYK gene ', ' CREB ', ' CREB1 ', ' cAMP Response Element-Binding Protein 1 ', ' CREB1 gene ', ' Address ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' DNA mutation ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' genomic alteration ', ' DNA Sequence Alteration ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Leukemic Cell ', ' Molecular ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Oncogenic ', ' chemotherapy ', ' therapeutic target ', ' prototype ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' standard of care ', ' treatment strategy ', ' exome sequencing ', ' exome-seq ', ' clinical risk ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' differential expression ', ' differentially expressed ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' individual patient ', ' prospective test ', ' mutational status ', ' mutation status ', ' relapse prediction ', ' predict relapse ', ' relapse risk ', ' clinical implementation ', ' risk prediction model ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,615576,CA-18
"Clinical and genetic analysis of retinopathy of prematurity Project Summary The long-term goal of this project is to establish a quantitative framework for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) care based on clinical, imaging, genetic, and informatics principles. In the previous grant period, we have developed artificial intelligence methods for ROP diagnosis, but real-world adoption has been limited by lack of prospective validation and by perception of these systems as “black boxes” that do not explain their rationale for diagnosis. Furthermore, although biomedical research data are being generated at an enormous pace, much less work has been done to integrate disparate scientific findings across the spectrum from genomics to imaging to clinical medicine. This renewal will address current gaps in knowledge in these areas. Our overall hypotheses are that developing a quantitative framework for ROP care using artificial intelligence and analytics will improve clinical disease management, that building “explainable” artificial intelligence systems will enhance clinical acceptance and educational opportunities, and that analysis of relationships among clinical, imaging, environmental, and genetic findings, in ROP will improve understanding of disease pathogenesis and risk. These hypotheses will be tested using three Specific Aims: (1) Evaluation performance of an artificial intelligence system for ROP diagnosis and screening prospectively. This will include: (a) recruit a target of over 2000 eye exams including wide-angle retinal images from 375 subjects at 5 centers, (b) optimize an image quality detection algorithm we have recently developed, and (c) analyze system accuracy for ROP diagnosis and screening (using a novel quantitative vascular severity scale). (2) Improve the interpretability of our existing artificial intelligence methods for ROP diagnosis. This will include: (a) increase “explainability” of systems by combining deep learning with traditional feature extraction methods, (b) develop neural networks to identify changes between serial images, and (c) evaluate these methods through systematic feedback by experts. (3) Develop integrated models for ROP pathogenesis and risk. This will include: (a) build and improve ROP risk prediction models based on clinical, image, and demographic features, and (b) integrate genetic, imaging, clinical, and environmental variables through genetic risk prediction by machine learning, by investigating casual relationships with genetic variants and genetic risk scores, and by incorporating SNP associations with gene expression measurements to identify functional genes of ROP. Ultimately, these studies will significantly reduce barriers to adoption of technologies such as artificial intelligence for clinicians, and will demonstrate a prototype for health information management which combines genotypic and phenotypic data. This project will be performed by a multi-disciplinary team of investigators who have worked successfully together for nearly 10 years, and who have expertise in ophthalmology, biomedical informatics, computer science, computational biology, ophthalmic genetics, genetic analysis, and statistical genetics. Project Narrative ROP is a leading cause of childhood blindness in the US and throughout the world, and the number of infants at risk for disease is increasing as the rate of premature birth rises.

"Stanford Advanced Wound Care Center Clinical Research Unit SUMMARY   Approximately  25%  of  diabetic  patients  experience  diabetic  foot  ulcers  (DFUs).  This  is  a  significant  clinical  problem since there are no effective biomarkers for predicting outcomes, no drug candidates that have recently  been  FDA-­approved  and  no  therapies  that  are  widely  effective  in  treatment.  The  Stanford  Advanced  Wound  Care  Center  (AWCC)  was  opened  in  2014  with  the  sole  purpose  of  facilitating  clinical  trials,  conducting  translational  research  and  providing  care  for  patients  with  chronic  wounds.  Stanford  AWCC  receives  patients  from the University Healthcare Alliance, which spans 60 clinics and 2.5 million people in the San Francisco Bay  Area.  Despite  being  in  a  relatively  prosperous  area,  Stanford  AWCC  treats  patients  from  diverse  socio-­ demographics. In the past two years, Stanford has treated 6000 patients with wounds, of whom 705 had DFUs.  50%  of  the  patients  enroll  in  clinical  trials  and  there  is  a  very  low  dropout  rate  (less  than  5%).  Under  Dr.  Geoffrey  Gurtner’s  leadership,  the  Stanford  AWCC  has  conducted  over  25  clinical  trials,  where  we  have  measured biomarkers and tested novel therapeutic interventions (Aim 1).     It is known that wound healing trials experience a significantly higher failure rate in Phase III studies compared  to  any  other  drug  trial.  This  is  primarily  due  to  the  poorly  controlled  procedural  component  of  wound  care.  At  Stanford,  we  address  these  issues  by  (i)  practicing  a  multi-­disciplinary  approach  overseen  by  physicians,  (ii)  standardizing  the  measuring  and  reporting  of  healing  outcomes,  (iii)  emphasizing  rigorous  and  efficient  operational  processes  during  clinical  trial  conduct  and  (iv)  collaborating  with  other  major  academic  centers  (Aim  2).  Looking  forward,  it  is  critical  to  optimize  patient  engagement  during  their  treatment  regimens  and  inculcate  a  shared  decision-­making  process.  Clinical  studies  in  medical  fields  such  as  cancer  have  indicated  that  such  patient-­centered  approaches  lead  to  the  adherence  of  treatment  regimens  and  clinical  trials.  This  is  currently  lacking  in  with  patients  with  DFUs.  With  Dr.  Arden  Morris’s  expertise,  the  Stanford  AWCC  practices  new approaches that centers around the patient, with a focus on improvement in their quality of life (Aim 3).     Dr.  Nigam  Shah,  the  Director  of  Bioinformatics  at  Spectrum,  Stanford’s  Clinical  and  Translational  Sciences  Award  has  worked  with  the  Stanford  AWCC  and  developed  computational  tools  that  predict  wound  healing  outcomes. These models have been developed using data from the Healogics database, the country’s largest  network  of  wound  care  clinics  and  a  Stanford  AWCC  operational  partner.  Dr.  Shah  also  has  expertise  in  analyzing electronic health records of patients from large databases such as TRUVEN and OPTUM, which will  allow  for  the  determination  of  unique  biomarkers  for  wound  healing  through  computational  modeling.  These  models can be executed across the entire Diabetic Foot Consortium (Aim 4).    Narrative    The  Stanford  Advanced  Wound  Care  Center  (AWCC)  was  opened  in  October  2014  to  fill  both  a  clinical  and  academic  need  by  integrating  clinical  trials  and  research  in  wound  care.  Since  its  launch,  the  number  of  patients  with  DFUs  at  Stanford  AWCC  has  doubled  in  each  of  the  past  two  years  and  the  unit  has  been  financially  successful,  ensuring  its  long-­term  viability.  Here,  we  demonstrate  the  ability  of  Stanford  AWCC  to  serve  as  a  Clinical  Research  Unit  (CRU)  by  displaying  access  to  patients  with  DFUs  from  a  wide  sociodemographic, emphasizing quality of clinical research conducted, demonstrating ways of patient-­centered  collaborative decision making and using big data to accurately predict and quantify wound healing outcomes.           ",Stanford Advanced Wound Care Center Clinical Research

"Algorithm for the Real-Time Detection of Absence Seizures from Oculometric Data Abstract Eysz, Inc. is developing an algorithm and software solutions to reliably and affordably detect seizures in an ambulatory setting using existing smart glass technologies. In a proof-of-concept study, Eysz was able to detect >75% of all absence seizures longer than 10 s in duration using only oculometric variables (e.g., pupil size, pupil location, eccentricity, blink frequency) detected using off-the-shelf eye-tracking technology. Eysz seeks to build on this finding by developing and commercializing highly sensitive and specific seizure detection algorithms using eye-movement data as input, with eventual expansion to additional seizure types. This technology has the potential to transform the detection and treatment of seizures for those with epilepsy, one of the most common neurological disorders worldwide. Timely treatment can reduce the chance of additional seizures by half, making early detection and treatment critical. Unfortunately, detection and diagnosis can be difficult using current technologies, especially in types of epilepsy with few observable symptoms such as absence seizures. The gold standard for detecting and characterizing seizure activity is electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring with video and subsequent review by a trained clinician, but this does not translate well to the outpatient setting. While attempts to develop ambulatory EEGs have been made, these have significant drawbacks, including poor patient acceptability, poor detection capability, and continued reliance on asynchronous review. Additional non-EEG- based motion detection devices are limited to tonic-clonic seizures, which are responsible for a small fraction of all seizure activity. Thus, there is a critical need to reliably detect seizures outside of the clinic to provide physicians with necessary information to guide therapeutic decision making. To address this need, Eysz is developing a digital health platform that leverages existing eye tracking technology to meet this significant unmet gap in the market and is technically feasible, capital-efficient, robust, and innovative. Eysz plans to use existing smart glass technology to export the necessary oculometric data to be analyzed by our seizure detection algorithm. We will also build out databases, software systems, and user interfaces enabling the resulting data to be stored in the cloud and visualized/analyzed by physicians. In this Phase I SBIR, Eysz will advance the development of the seizure detection algorithms by: 1) obtaining oculometric video and EEG data on ≥100 absence seizures from multiple patients, and 2) using ML and statistical methods to optimize an algorithm for identifying absence seizures using eye-tracking data, with a target sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 90%. Lessons learned from this study will be applied (with different training sets) to additional seizures types, such as focal impaired awareness (formerly called complex partial) seizures, the most prevalent seizure type in adults. This work is of critical importance to the field, as demonstrated by support from the Epilepsy Foundation and receipt of both the judges' and people's choice awards in the Epilepsy Foundation's 8th Annual Shark Tank Competition. Narrative More than 70 million people worldwide suffer from epilepsy, a debilitating, unpredictable chronic condition that results in significant disability and increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Seizure detection and characterization is critical to choosing an appropriate treatment regimen, and appropriate anticonvulsants can decrease seizures by 50%. Eysz's proposed seizure detection solution will provide unobtrusive, objective, automated detection of seizure activity in an outpatient setting in near real time, improving medical decision- making, decreasing time to treatment, reducing mortality, and ultimately improving quality of life for those with epilepsy.",Algorithm for the Real-Time Detection of Absence Seizures from Oculometric Data,10372655,R43NS119015,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anticonvulsants ', ' Anticonvulsant Agent ', ' Anticonvulsant Drugs ', ' Anticonvulsive Agents ', ' Anticonvulsive Drugs ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Blinking ', ' eye blink ', ' eyeblink ', ' Capital ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Electrodes ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Absence Epilepsy ', ' Absence Seizure Disorder ', ' Absence Seizures ', ' Childhood Absence Epilepsy ', ' Juvenile Absence Epilepsy ', ' Minor Epilepsy ', ' Petit Mal Convulsion ', ' Petit Mal Epilepsy ', ' Pykno-Epilepsy ', ' Pyknolepsy ', ' petit mal seizure ', ' Eye Movements ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Glass ', ' Gold ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Pupil ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Risk ', ' Seizures ', ' Shark ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Work ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Letters ', ' Therapeutic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Location ', ' grand mal seizure ', ' Tonic - clonic seizures ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' eye tracking ', ' visual tracking ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Devices ', ' partial seizure ', ' Focal Seizure ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electroencephalogram ', ' Advanced Development ', ' software systems ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' commercialization ', ' high risk ', ' Algorithmic Software ', ' Algorithmic Tools ', ' Software Algorithm ', ' improved outcome ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' algorithm development ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' digital health ', ' detection platform ', ' detection system ', ' ']",NINDS,"EYSZ, INC.",R43,2021,52000,CA-13
"Oklahoma Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in Basic Biology of Aging A Data Science Workshop (DSW) hosted at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC) originated as a small gathering of local scientific computing specialists to share techniques and methods. However, as high-throughput data generation and AI/ML have gained prominence, there has been greatly increased demand from non-specialists, including PIs, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students whose work mostly entails bench biology, for introductory and intermediate training in all aspects of data acquisition, storage, and analysis. They are generally computer-savvy already and able to program to some degree, and their interest is in short, hands-on demonstrations of how to apply AI/ML methods to data either generated or accessible via their research. The interest in data science classes is growing at OUHSC, but this need is still not met. Currently, the DSW is a volunteer effort, and the nascent OUHSC data science curriculum has minimal instruction on how to make data AI/ML ready or how to follow FAIR principles. This supplement will enable us to develop material on these topics and promulgate it via workshops, coursework, and freely accessible online content.

"Predicting and Preventing Gun Violence: An Evaluation of READI Chicago Abstract Young Black men are 20 times as likely to be fatally shot than their White counterparts, and more lose their lives to homicide than the next nine leading causes of death combined (CDC 2020). Chicago, which saw homicides spike by over 50% in 2016 and 2020, is a stark example of this problem: over 90% of cases involved a firearm. As in many cities, the victims are overwhelmingly young Black men from a handful of disadvantaged neighborhoods. Despite the extremely high social cost generated by this kind of violence, few interventions have considered the effectiveness of finding those most likely to be involved in shootings, and providing them with economic, behavioral, and personal support services instead of more law enforcement. This project is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a new intervention for men at the highest risk of gun violence, designed to test a behaviorally-informed, social service-based approach. The Rapid Employment and Development Initiative (READI) identifies men in Chicago at the highest risk of being involved in a shooting via three methods: machine learning predictions based on administrative arrest and victimization records; referrals from street outreach staff working in the communities served; and screening among those leaving prison and jail. READI then provides 18 months of supported, subsidized work alongside cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and personal development programming. READI builds on evidence from prior RCTs of CBT- based programming that find it can dramatically reduce violence and other criminal behavior (Blattman et al., 2017; Heller et al., 2017), suggesting it may be possible to reduce the most socially costly forms of violence without incurring the collateral costs of stepped-up law enforcement efforts. Over three years, 2,456 men were randomly assigned either to a treatment group offered READI or a control group free to pursue other available services. This is the largest RCT of an individual-level gun violence intervention conducted to date. The study’s primary goal is to measure impact results on serious violence involvement and other criminal behavior using administrative arrest and victimization records. The rich data sources and experimental design also gives us the opportunity to learn how well each of the recruitment methods anticipates actual shooting and violence involvement. Since there could be a trade-off between a participant’s risk level and their responsiveness to treatment, we will also analyze what the variation in risk, take-up rates, and program impacts across recruitment methods teach us about socially optimal targeting. Lastly, we will combine impact results, qualitative data collection, and a benefit-cost comparison to draw out broader policy implications about cities’ efforts to address the enormous social costs of serious violence. Project Narrative Intentional gun violence injures or kills 170 people a day in the U.S., with young Black men over 20 times as likely to die as White men of the same age. Despite gun violence’s enormous health and social costs, there is little settled evidence on effective strategies to prevent shooting and homicide involvement—especially ones that avoid the social costs of stepped-up law enforcement. Our randomized experiment aims to provide such evidence by first identifying those at highest risk for gun violence and then testing the effectiveness of a cognitive behavioral-informed social service intervention designed to reduce their involvement in shootings and other serious violence.",Predicting and Preventing Gun Violence: An Evaluation of READI Chicago,10400479,R01MD017194,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Chicago ', ' Cities ', ' Cognition ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Costs and Benefits ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Sources ', ' Economics ', ' Employment ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Federal Government ', ' National Government ', ' Firearms ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Homicide ', ' Illinois ', ' Inpatients ', ' Learning ', ' Los Angeles ', ' male ', ' Memory ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Persons ', ' New York City ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Prisons ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' State Government ', ' Provincial Government ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Police ', ' falls ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' violence prevention ', ' prevent violence ', ' Law Enforcement ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' criminal behavior ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Nongovernmental Organizations ', ' Non-governmental Organizations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Victimization ', ' Adopted ', ' Reaction ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Services ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' American ', ' authority ', ' City Government ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' peace ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' parole ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Jail ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Interruption ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Cognitive ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' gun violence ', ' firearm violence ', ' Outcome ', ' high risk men ', ' men at high risk ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' high risk ', ' policy implication ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' young man ', ' adolescent man ', ' adolescent men ', ' screening ', ' treatment group ', ' neighborhood disadvantage ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' recruit ', ' gun homicide ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' effectiveness testing ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' black men ', ' black male ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2021,1867461,IL-01
"Protein Signatures of APOE2 and Cognitive Aging Improving AI/ML readiness of data generated under the R01: Protein signatures of APOE2 and AG061844 “Protein signatures of APOE2 and cognitive aging”, we are generating proteomic and metabolomics data in a cohort of centenarians, their offspring, and unrelated controls from the New England Centenarian Study (NECS). Study participants have been characterized with detailed medical history, genetic profiles, and longitudinal assessment of physical and cognitive functions. The goal of the parent R01 is to validate a proteomic signature of APOE genotypes, and to evaluate its value together with metabolic profiles to predict patterns of cognitive function change in aging individuals. We plan to share data through the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) portal, and the new extreme longevity (EL) portal that is currently under development. Sharing the data in an unrestricted manner is not possible because they include HIPAA identifiers, particularly age >89. Unrestricted sharing of data would be an attractive option for AI/ML investigators, and the goal of this request for administrative supplement is to cognitive aging. Funded by the NIA: R01 use advanced machine learning techniques to generate high-fidelity, privacy-preserving, synthetic versions of the data obtained in the parent achine learning methods have emerged that can be used to generate synthetic data using a model that is trained in the real data. This model can be used to generate a synthetic data set in which no single data point corresponds to a real person in the original data set, but the synthetic data can be analyzed to produce results that are like those derived from the original data. This approach has received substantial attention in the past few years, and it has been adopted to compromise between data sharing and privacy, including generation of synthetic data for the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C). We have put together a team of data scientists and partners from the company Syntegra R01 so they can be shared without restriction. M , to generate and validate a synthetic data set that matches the data generated with the parent R01. Our proposal is structured in three aims. In Aim 1, we will share with Syntegra real data from the NECS that include proteomics and metabolomics, genetic variables and patients’ characteristics including assessment of cognitive function. This real data will be used to train the data generation model and create synthetic data sets. In Aim 2 we will d evelop a protocol for validation of the synthetic data sets that includes fidelity to a variety of results of machine learning analyses and metrics to assess the deidentification of data. In Aim 3 we will conduct the analysis in the real and synthetic data sets and compare the results. Impact. This is a high risk, but potentially high return proposal. If the approach works, we will be able to generate data that can be widely shared with the community. The approach will also be applicable to several other studies of aging that struggle with the issues of data sharing to enhance scientific research while preserving privacy. Narrative The goal of this application is to develop a model trained in real data generated from the parent R01 and use the model to simulate a high-fidelity, privacy-preserving, synthetic versions of the real data that can be shared without restriction. The impact of this strategy is to simplify sharing data with the AI/ML community, thus increasing the usability of the data and the potential impact of the parent R01.

"STABILITY' (symptomatic review during biologic therapy) Review in Inflammatory Bowel Disease PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal responds to the NOSI funding opportunity announcement for women’s complementary/alternative health approaches in IDeA states to more effectively manage women’s health. Immune-mediated diseases typically show a female preponderance and looking at all autoimmune diseases combined, 8 of 10 patients are females. Although not as prominent, gender differences in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have been reported for epidemiology, disease presentation, disease course and complications, medical and surgical therapies, adherence, psychosocial functioning, and psychiatric co-disorders (Greuter et al., 2020). IBD (including Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)) has significant and progressive health issues affecting women. The Department of Gastroenterology and Internal Medicine subdivision of LSU Health Sciences Center in Shreveport serves a predominantly minority-based urban population with a large rural catchment area. Our IBD patients historically received their infusions of biologic therapy (Remicade, Cimizia) as a ‘nurse only visit’ at our infusion center. However, starting March 2019, we started having one of the GI fellows and faculty see all IBD patients during these infusion visits. These brief visits included an interview with the patient about his/her current symptoms, review of their labs and drug levels and assessed if there was need to complete any care gaps (endoscopy, abdominal imaging, vaccinations, etc.). These ‘STABILITY’ (symptomatic review during biologic therapy) visits took ~15 minutes. Based on our first preliminary study of symptomatic review during biologic infusion therapy (STABILITY) in IBD patients in this service area for the period of March 2019 to March 2020 this approach improves disease control at earlier phases and maintains patient clinical progress at reduced cost and with fewer hospitalizations. Surveyed patients expressed unanimous enthusiasm for continued STABILITY review with their doctors during infusion visits Hypothesis. Based on these preliminary findings, it is our hypothesis that very modest changes in disease review in female patients with IBD can dramatically improve their outcomes and reduce hospitalizations. Aim 1. Determine in which female patients (African-American vs. white, age group, socioeconomic status, insurance status, etc.) does ‘STABILITY’ review improve patient outcomes, their quality of life while at the same time reducing overall costs of care. Aim 2. Which clinical features of IBD (such as disease severity, CRP, calprotectin, sedimentation rate and other inflammatory biomarkers) are best improved by ‘STABILITY’ review. Aim 3. Incorporate the results of our study into the clinical decision support system providing individualized symptom management recommendations to clinicians at the point of care to improve outcomes of female IBD patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE US has some of the highest rates of IBD and with majority of IBD diagnosed before the age of 30, and the impact on women’s health is profound. Our project incorporates STABILITY review to build a clinical decision support system for individualized point of care improvements that result in improved women’s patient care and outcomes.

"Neural signatures of virtual and real-world navigation and spatial learning PROJECT SUMMARY Navigation is one of our most foundational behavioral capacities, and substantial work using rodent models has established the hippocampus as a critical contributor to this complex behavior. However, efforts to model these effects in humans have been limited, both in scope and generalizability. Little work has explored the interaction in the hippocampus between navigation and foundational non-navigation learning processes, like statistical learning, and it therefore remains unclear how navigation processes are integrated with and may be supported by these learning mechanisms. Further, studies in humans have primarily consisted of virtual navigation, limiting applicability and relevance of the established neural signals to real-world navigation behavior. Understanding how navigation and statistical learning compete or cooperate in the human hippocampus will significantly inform models of memory systems and consolidation, and addressing these questions in a real-world paradigm will close a wide gap in our understanding of human navigation. This requires a multimodal approach, coupling the high temporal and spatial resolution of intracranial EEG (iEEG) in epilepsy patients with quantitative behavioral measures of human navigation and learning. In my doctoral dissertation work thus far, I have used behavioral, computational, and iEEG methods to test hypotheses about the interaction between statistical learning and spatial navigation in the human hippocampus and related structures. My work has produced impactful findings via novel computational modeling techniques and innovative multivariate iEEG analyses. In my proposed research and training program, I will use a cutting-edge research method to collect direct neural recordings from chronic brain implants in human participants as they physically ambulate in the real world. Through my multidisciplinary research mentors, this experience will provide me training with novel research methodology and ecologically valid experiment design, as well as clinical perspectives, considerations, and practices for working with patients with epilepsy. In my proposed postdoctoral training phase, I will pursue a more clinical focus, returning to the question of how modern cognitive neuroscience can guide assessments and therapies for hippocampal disease. I will gain theoretical and practical experience with high-resolution imaging and data collection with hippocampal atrophy populations, including epilepsy and Alzheimer’s patients. This research program has the potential to inform and substantially extend models of human navigation and memory by exploring the intersection of multiple processing demands on the hippocampus as a shared neural resource, and how these processes operate in the real world. This work represents the convergence of disparate literatures on hippocampal function, and informs diagnosis and treatment of hippocampal patients. This program will equip me not only with expertise in behavioral, computational, and neuroscientific methodologies, but the basic and clinical theoretical acumen necessary to conduct independent investigation as a principal investigator across disciplines. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research program seeks to evaluate and extend theories of spatial navigation and learning in humans by assessing the complex role of the hippocampus. The series of proposed projects stands to significantly benefit public health by exploring behavioral and neural assays of hippocampal disease in patient populations, with the potential to ultimately influence therapies for associated navigational and memory deficits. Integration of behavioral, neurophysiological, and neuroimaging methods, across basic and clinical approaches, are key components of this project which will enable empirically and theoretically supported paths forward in addressing this particularly debilitating form of neurodegeneration.",Neural signatures of virtual and real-world navigation and spatial learning,10393754,F99NS125835,"['Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Felis catus ', ' Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Feline Species ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cognition ', ' classical conditioning ', ' Associative Learning ', ' Pavlovian conditioning ', ' associative conditioning ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Environment ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Fire -

"A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The world’s population is aging and the increasing number of older adults with chronic health conditions is a challenge our society must address. While the idea of smart environments is now a reality, there remain gaps in our knowledge about how to scale smart homes technologies for use in complex settings and to use machine learning (ML) and activity learning technologies to design automated health assessment and intervention strategies. The long-term objective of the parent project is to improve human health and positively impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The primary objective of this supplement project is to extend the design of our ‘clinician-in-the-loop’ smart home to include computational methods for recognizing and reporting on bias in ML algorithms. Bias in ML algorithms is a public health hazard. A secondary objective is to add to the scarce body of knowledge regarding ML techniques for assessing and quantifying algorithm bias. In this supplement study, we will demonstrate how to operationalize bioethics principles such as autonomy (the right to make informed decisions about care and right to be informed about any associated risks) into actionable design requirements to close the gap between principles and practice. We will then share these with the ML healthcare application (ML- HCA) research community by creating a new open source online course containing 3 modules. This supplement proposal builds upon our extensive experience in the CASAS lab at Washington State University and prior collaboration on the development of smart home design, activity recognition, and the use of these technologies for functional health monitoring, assessment, and intervention. This supplement effort will allow us to expand our sample size and enhance the robustness of pervasive-computing-based behavior monitoring and machine learning to further advance the quality of health monitoring, including bias recognition. We will offer new advances in computational methods for anti-bias algorithm development using data from smart homes and smart watches that are monitoring the daily activities of underrepresented persons. Our course modules will support knowledge development regarding how to operationalize bioethics principles for practice at each stage of ML-HCA design. In the online course we will also address the importance and impact of multidisciplinary teams in designing for transparency, fairness, and non-discriminatory ML-HCA applications such as the health smart home. Given that ML models are known to introduce bias and risk to members of minority groups and given our national conversation on equity, fundamental human rights, and the risks associated with living as a minority person, it is critical that health technology-human interface with underrepresented persons is improved. Anti-bias ML training techniques that could be broadly applied in the development of ML-HCAs would be of significant value to minority individuals and families and all of society. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposed supplement builds on the parent “clinician-in-the-loop” smart home study that automatically identifies health events for adults with chronic conditions in their own homes. In this supplement, we will use smart home and wearable data from minority persons for developing clinician-guided novel computational methods to train our ML models to recognize and report on bias of sensitive demographic features (e.g., race, low SES) to mitigate the negative impacts of bias on informed consenting and autonomous decision-making regarding health monitoring that uses an intelligent agent. This research is relevant to public health because technologies that do not perpetuate bias would be of significant value to minority individuals and families and to all of society.",A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions,10367017,R01NR016732,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Bioethics ', ' Biomedical Ethics ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Decision Making ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health delivery systems ', ' health services delivery ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Rights ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Intelligence ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Minority People ', ' Minority Population ', ' Persons ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Rights ', ' Risk ', ' Self Determination ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Societies ', ' Technology ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Health Hazards ', ' Training Technics ', ' Training Technique ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' behavior change ', ' experience ', ' Proxy ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' cognitive change ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' Behavior monitoring ', ' behavioral monitoring ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' open source ', ' parent project ', ' mindfulness ', ' intervention effect ', ' course module ', ' class module ', ' online course ', ' E-course ', ' online curriculum ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' Data Analytics ', ' brain health ', ' smart watch ', ' smartwatch ', ' health assessment ', ' aging in place ', ' age in place ', ' smart home ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' intelligent agent ', ' learning algorithm ', ' algorithm development ', ' Home ', ' ']",NINR,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,144139,WA-05
"Human-Machine Collaborations to Improve Prognosis and Clinical Decision-Making in Advanced Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Advance care planning and palliative care represent evidence-based, high-quality care for patients with advanced cancer. Early identification of patients at risk of short-term mortality is a promising strategy to increase advance care planning and palliative care. However, this is limited by prognostic inaccuracy among oncology clinicians, who overestimate prognosis for 70% of their patients with advanced cancer. While recent advances in electronic health record (EHR) infrastructure and machine learning (ML) have allowed accurate identification of patient' mortality risk, there is a fundamental gap in understanding how to integrate ML prognostic algorithms alongside clinician intuition (“human-machine collaborations”) in the routine care of patients with cancer. Dr. Parikh's research objective is to develop and test human-machine collaborative systems that leverage ML algorithms to improve clinicians' prognostic accuracy in order to prompt earlier advance care planning and palliative care among patients with advanced cancer. In prior work, Dr. Parikh has prospectively validated and embedded into the EHR an automated ML algorithm to predict short-term mortality risk among patients with cancer. In this application, Dr. Parikh proposes to take a fundamental next step in this work by exploring strategies to improve prognostic accuracy and decision-making among oncologists treating patients with advanced cancer. In Aim 1, Dr. Parikh will retrain and validate the existing ML mortality risk prediction algorithm by integrating recently-available patient-generated health data. In Aim 2, Dr. develop prognostic that Parikh will a vignette-based survey to assess optimal strategies of presenting ML predictions to improve accuracy. He will administer this survey to a large national sample of medical oncologists to ensure clinician perspectives are incorporated into interventions.In Aim 3, Dr. Parikh will develop two models of human-machine collaborative systems to generate real-time mortality estimates that integrate clinician and algorithm predictions. In a pragmatic multi-institutional clinical trial among patients with advanced cancer, Dr. Parikh will test the impact of human-machine collaborations on prognostic accuracy and rates of advanced care planning and palliative care referral. These findings will have important implications for patients with cancer, their caregivers, oncology clinicians, and health systems. More broadly, the methods proposed may serve as a blueprint to develop and evaluate human-machine collaborations in oncology. This facilitate judgment highly-qualified Dr. development improving research will t raining in areas vital to Dr. Parikh's career goals: dvanced predictive modeling, survey methods and and decision-making, human-machine interfaces, and pragmatic clinical trials. Dr. Parikh has two and committed mentors: Dr. Justin Bekelman, an expert i n cancer care delivery r esearch, and Jinbo Chen, an expert in EHR-based predictive model development.

"Development of a program to assess and treat distress in glaucoma patients using an automated EHR-derived AI algorithm PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Glaucoma is a disease that results in irreversible blindness and due to its chronic, progressive nature, imposes a psychosocial burden on patients. Appropriately, the focus of ophthalmologists is on controlling the disease to prevent vision loss. Yet, patient’s psychosocial distress during and after therapy has not been routinely addressed and is another important target of care. Psychosocial distress (i.e., anxiety, depression) negatively impacts all outcomes in glaucoma and is associated with poor follow-up and medication adherence, worse vision-related quality-of-life and disease severity, and faster rates of visual field progression. Direct assessment and treatment of psychosocial distress is likely to improve glaucoma outcomes. While uncommon in glaucoma clinics, psychosocial distress screening has been occurring with some consistency in other medical settings (e.g., oncology) for more than a decade, leading to referrals for intervention and improvements in psychosocial distress and subsequently overall health. Our overarching scientific premise is that a screening program for psychosocial distress (i.e., anxiety, depression) in glaucoma clinics would enhance the patient’s adherence to medical recommendations, and quality-of-life, ultimately leading to improvements in vision-related outcomes (e.g., visual field progression). Patient-reported outcome measures are the gold standard measures of distress, however are not routinely collected in patients with glaucoma due to perceived time and cost burdens. To remedy this, the PI proposes an automated pre-screening framework, motivated by preliminary analyses that demonstrate that distress can be reliably identified using predictive modeling based on glaucoma clinical risk factors from electronic health records (EHR) data. This predictive model will be developed in aim 1 using an existing EHR database, the Duke Glaucoma Registry, and will yield automated risk estimates of distress that can be used to inform clinical decision making, regarding the administration of a distress survey; therefore, limiting distress assessment to a subset of high-risk patients. Secondary aims will focus on external validation of the automated technique, and gauging acceptability to distress screening in a glaucoma clinic (aim 2), and the refinement of a behavioral intervention to improve coping skills for distress in patients with glaucoma (aim 3). This research will positively impact patient well- being in glaucoma, serving as an evidence-based assessment of a distress screening program. The proposal also details a training plan to help the PI transition from a postdoctoral scholar to an independent researcher. The mentored phase of the award will be supervised by the primary mentor, Dr. Felipe Medeiros, and multidisciplinary mentoring team including Dr. Tamara Somers (Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences), Dr. David Page (Biostatistics & Bioinformatics), and Dr. Kevin Weinfurt (Population Health Sciences). Performing the proposed research, formal coursework, and mentored career development will provide the PI with highly sought-after skills and experiences to help ensure a successful transition to independence. PROJECT NARRATIVE Psychosocial distress is a common comorbidity associated with the glaucoma experience and left untreated can contribute to worse outcomes, including worse vision-related quality-of-life and disease severity, faster rates of visual field progression, and poor follow-up and medication adherence, and glaucoma comprehension. The work described in this proposal will introduce and validate an automated assessment and treatment screening program for distress in glaucoma, through innovative predictive modeling of existing healthcare and research database systems. The outcome of this project will shed light on the importance of recognizing distress in the course of glaucoma clinical care, and provide evidence to support new approaches and paradigms to assess and treat glaucoma-induced distress.",Development of a program to assess and treat distress in glaucoma patients using an automated EHR-derived AI algorithm,10282287,K99EY033027,"['Algorithms ', '

"From atoms to mechanisms - Artificial Intelligence augmented molecular simulations for mechanistic ligand design While there have been numerous advances in computational methods aiding in rational drug design, most approaches so far take a static view of the drug target, ignoring the complexities associated with the dynamics and thermodynamics of conformational transitions. There is thus a pressing need for new computational methods that are accurate, tractable and automatable for large scale drug discovery and chemical biology studies that account for the changing nature of a generic drug target. Built on strong theoretical and computational preliminary results, this program seeks to understand and guide design of new inhibitors of tyrosine kinases and model riboswitches in a mechanistically guided paradigm. Our research program is driven by the central hypotheses that (a) mechanistically aware ligand design strategies can outperform traditional strategies guided only by structure, and (b) artificial intelligence (AI)- integrated molecular dynamics (MD) simulation methods can help learn mechanisms in a high-throughput fashion. Our program can be split into two overarching yet complementary thematic areas. In the first area, we will develop sampling algorithms at the interface of statistical mechanics, MD simulations and AI to probe mechanisms for rare event processes, such as drug unbinding and conformational change. Specifically we will build on our preliminary work in using ideas from neural information processing and natural language processing, and adapt them for advanced sampling methods that learn reaction coordinate, thermodynamics and kinetics on-the-fly as the simulation progresses. In addition, we will also be interacting closely with other leading computational groups to integrate our sampling methods with theirs and to facilitate efficient, accurate sampling for polarizable force-field development. In the second area, we will use our algorithms to guide mechanistically driven design of inhibitors of Src, Abl kinases and PreQ1 riboswitches. We will take a mechanistically driven perspective wherein we will map out the different conformations of a given target and understand how an existing ligand interacts with these, and then propose ligand modifications based upon this understanding. We will use our AI-augmented MD methods to understand the dissociation mechanisms of ligands in one uninterrupted “atoms to mechanism” workflow with minimal human intervention. All our predictions will be validated in different ways by our experimental collaborators at Stony Brook University and the National Cancer Institute This MIRA proposal will develop sampling algorithms at the interface of statistical mechanics and artificial intelligence to probe mechanisms for rare event processes, such as drug unbinding and conformational change in drug targets. These algorithms will be used to guide mechanistically driven design of inhibitors of Src, Abl kinases and PreQ1 riboswitches.",From atoms to mechanisms - Artificial Intelligence augmented molecular simulations for mechanistic ligand design,10275014,R35GM142719,"['Algorithms ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Awareness ', ' Biology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Drug Design ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Kinetics ', ' Learning ', ' Ligands ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Phosphotransferases ', ' Kinases ', ' Phosphotransferase Gene ', ' Transphosphorylases ', ' Research ', ' Thermodynamics ', ' Thermodynamic ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Generic Drugs ', ' Non-proprietary Drugs ', ' Nonproprietary Drugs ', ' Dissociation ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Chemicals ', ' Nature ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' Reaction ', ' Molecular Dynamics Simulation ', ' molecular dynamics ', ' neural information processing ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' drug discovery ', ' PTK Inhibitors ', ' Protein Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors ', ' TK Inhibitors ', ' Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' Statistical Mechanics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' conformational conversion ', ' conformational transition ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' augmented intelligence ', ' ']",NIGMS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R35,2021,373755,MD-05
"Peripheral Artery Disease: Long-term Survival & Outcomes Study (PEARLS) Project Summary/Abstract Background: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a common and highly morbid condition. Nearly 25% of patients die within 3 years of diagnosis, likely due to a high incidence of cardiovascular (CV) events: myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke. A significantly larger proportion experience disability due to leg pain, poor mobility and amputation. The cost of PAD-related hospital care alone exceeds $21 billion. However, research regarding long-term survival, CV, and limb outcomes in PAD and the impact of existing treatments remain limited in large part due to the poor accuracy of PAD diagnosis codes. Our team has developed a novel approach using natural language processing (NLP) to identify PAD patients with a high degree of accuracy within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Significance: The Peripheral Artery Disease: Long-term Survival & Outcomes Study (PEARLS) study will advance scientific knowledge for PAD in several ways. We will use our NLP tool to assemble one of the largest cohorts of PAD in the world and follow them long-term to assess the trajectory of survival and clinical outcomes, evaluate utilization of recommended treatments (medications, risk factor control and revascularization) and the association of above treatments with the above outcomes. Collectively, our work will address important gaps in PAD research and yield insights regarding strategies to improve care delivery in this high-risk population. Innovation: The use of an informatics-based method to assemble a cohort of newly diagnosed PAD patients in a large integrated health system is highly innovative. We believe that our approach for cohort identification will be transformational and promote big data analytics for research, improving care delivery, and future clinical trials. Specific Aims: A1. Develop a national cohort of Veterans with newly diagnosed PAD using a novel NLP algorithm. A2. Examine patterns of medical and invasive management and determine patient- and facility-level correlates. A3. Determine the impact of medical and invasive management of PAD on long-term outcomes. Methodology: We will implement our NLP algorithm to identify patients with new PAD diagnosis in VHA during 2015-2020 and obtain data on clinical and treatment related variables. We will follow our cohort longitudinally for mortality, CV events (MI, stroke) and limb events (amputation). We will examine utilization of PAD treatments and risk factor control, identify patient-level and hospital-level predictors of treatment using multi-level models. We will use discrete survival models to evaluate the association of PAD treatments with long-term outcomes. Implementation/Next Steps: Key deliverables will include a) an understanding of which patient groups are at greatest risk for mortality and adverse outcomes; (b) determining the relative impact of PAD treatments on long- term outcomes which can be useful for decision-making and c) an assessment of site-level variation in treatment patterns. We envision that our findings will help us develop comprehensive disease management program to improve quality of care and reduce disparities in use of effective treatments. Project Narrative Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a common and highly morbid condition that is a major cause of leg amputation, and associated with a high risk of heart attack, stroke and death. We propose to create a large cohort of PAD patients who will be identified using a novel method developed by our research team and followed long-term to advance our understanding of the trajectory of survival and clinical outcomes in PAD and the impact of existing treatments on patient outcomes.

"Real-time spectroscopic photoacoustic/ultrasound (PAUS) scanner withsimultaneous fluence and motion compensation to guide and validateinterventions: system development and preclinical testing. Abstract The goal of this project is to develop a clinical real-time spectroscopic photoacoustic/ultrasound (PAUS) system for molecular guidance of interventional procedures through a partnership between UW and GE Research. Recently, we proposed a new, fast-sweep concept for PA imaging. To put this concept into practice, we first developed a unique, compact, diode-pumped, tunable (700 -900 nm) laser operating at very high (up to 1000 Hz) repetition rates and relatively low (~ 1 mJ) pulse energies, and a fiber-optic delivery system to sequentially couple laser pulses into the imaging probe. In addition to US B-mode, and all other US modes, the system simultaneously produces real-time (50 Hz) spectroscopic PA images, which were combined for the first time for real-time PAUS imaging. A unique feature is automatic on-line laser-fluence compensation and motion correction, enabling quantitative optical absorption spectroscopy at every image pixel. Spectroscopy can identify substances opaque to US based on their molecular constituents (drugs/contrast agents), and quantify tissue functional changes (e.g., blood oxygenation and its concentration) within the image; in addition, manipulation with a needle is better visualized with PA. UW will work with GE Research to integrate spectroscopic PAUS into a high-end US scanner to create a clinical-grade PAUS system, and test whether it can improve interventional procedure guidance in general and, particularly, in ethanol (EA) ablation therapies of recurrent thyroid tumors. The prognosis for most people with thyroid cancer after primary treatment is very good, but the recurrence rate or persistence can be up to 30%. If recurrent cancer is confirmed, image-guided nonsurgical procedures such as EA or radio frequency ablation (RFA) are commonly used alternatives to more invasive procedures. Although US helps position EA and RFA needles, on-line imaging of the ablative area and confirmation of ablation remain difficult for US. When the recurrent nodule (especially the capillary network in it) is not entirely treated, the cancer will return with possible metastasis. We hypothesize here that real-time spectroscopic PAUS will improve the efficacy of ablation procedures and dramatically reduce procedure repetitions. If successful in this initial stage, the project will move to a clinical trial to both guide and validate ablative therapies and explore real-time spectroscopic PAUS for other interventional procedures. SA1 will integrate our unique laser and scanning fiber-optic delivery system with a clinical GE US scanner for real-time spectroscopic PAUS. Then, SA2 will develop real-time signal processing tools for motion correction and fluence compensation and imaging protocols for spectroscopic PAUS. SA3 will focus on optimizing the PAUS system using phantom and ex vivo studies. Finally, in SA4 the developed PAUS system will be used to test the clinical applicability of PAUS guidance with three in vivo models, including small animal studies of thyroid cancer, an animal model approximating human anatomy, and pilot measurements on human subjects. Real-time spectroscopic photoacoustic/ultrasound (PAUS) scanner with simultaneous fluence and motion compensation to guide and validate interventions: system development and preclinical testing Narrative Real-time ultrasound (US) is commonly used to guide interventional procedures, but for injections of therapeutic agents such as ethanol, the drug itself cannot be directly visualized. Photoacoustics (PA), combining pulsed light delivery to the body with US detection of light absorbing structures within the body, has been proposed to bring a molecular dimension to US to help view molecular substances such as drugs, but its clinical translation has been greatly limited by both fundamental issues related to tissue motion and wavelength-dependent light intensity variations within the body and practical issues related to the size, speed, and expense of the laser systems typically used for imaging. Here we present a completely new approach integrating PA and US (PAUS) imaging to directly address both fundamental and practical issues limiting clinical translation, and will test it by developing and evaluating a clinical real-time PAUS system as a robust molecular guidance tool for interventional procedures.",Real-time spectroscopic photoacoustic/ultrasound (PAUS) scanner withsimultaneous

"Identifying brain networks to predict treatment resistance and post-surgical outcome: An ENIGMA-Epilepsy initiative ABSTRACT  Epilepsy is a devastating neurological illness that affects over 50 million people worldwide. Approximately one-third of patients do not respond to anti-seizure medication (ASM) and require additional diagnostic work-up, including consideration for surgery. Structural neuroimaging plays a pivotal role in the diagnostic evaluation of epilepsy, identifying visible lesions in many patients that co-localize with the seizure focus. However, up to 40% of patients have normal-appearing MRIs and this number is growing. As a result, there is increased interest in identifying subtle brain network abnormalities that could help to delineate the epileptogenic network and aid in the prediction of treatment response (i.e., response to ASMs and surgical outcomes). Unfortunately, methods for reliably identifying which patients will be drug-responsive versus drug- resistant, and which patients will achieve successful versus unsuccessful surgical outcomes are lacking.  A major barrier to progress in this field has been obtaining quantitative imaging, including structural MRI (sMRI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (dMRI), clinical, and genetic data on large, geographically diverse samples of patients in whom different treatment outcomes can be evaluated. In the past, sample sizes have been insufficient to detect subtle, but reliable, brain abnormalities in patients with focal or generalized epilepsies that are genuinely associated with epilepsy and not with vicissitudes related to small or geographically restricted samples.  A new, large-scale data initiative, ENIGMA4-Epilepsy, coupled with technological advancements that enable improved data harmonization are now lifting these barriers and allowing us to combine multi-site sMRI/dMRI, clinical, genetic data to predict important clinical outcomes, and making the results generalizable to a global epilepsy community. In this grant, we will leverage data collected through ENIGMA-Epilepsy—a consortium of 24 epilepsy centers from 14 countries (more than 2,250 patient and 1,727 healthy control sMRI/dMRI datasets) and the Human Epilepsy Project (HEP). We will include new network models (i.e., individualized connectomes) and polygenic risk scores (PRS) to test whether a combination of imaging, clinical, and genetic risk can accurately predict two clinical outcomes: drug-resistance and post-operative seizure outcome. Our scientific premise is that MRI-based assessment of whole-brain network properties, in combination with clinical data and PRS derived from genetic data, are able to predict (i) drug response in recently diagnosed epilepsy cases and (ii) postsurgical outcomes in individuals with drug-resistant epilepsy.  This R01 addresses NIH's call for more reproducible studies by introducing a highly-powered design capable of capturing variability across patients with diverse clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes. This grant is also directly aligned with NINDS's 2020 Epilepsy Benchmarks (IIIB), which encourage the identification of genetic, clinical, and imaging biomarkers capable of predicting treatment response in epilepsy. NARRATIVE Epilepsy is a devastating neurological illness, affecting over 50 million people world-wide. In this project, we will leverage the ENIGMA-Epilepsy infrastructure to address how quantitative, non-invasive neuroimaging, clinical and genetic data can be used to predict (1) which patients will respond to anti-seizure medications versus which will remain drug-resistant and (2) which patients will achieve favorable versus unfavorable surgical outcomes. The research will be accomplished by applying a series of hypothesis-driven and data- driven (i.e., machine learning) approaches to clinical and imaging data on an exceptionally large cohort of patients with common epilepsy syndromes, providing unprecedented power to tackle critical treatment-related questions in epilepsy.",Identifying brain networks to predict treatment resistance and

"Learning to Predict Delayed Cerebral Ischemia with Novel Continuous Cerebral Arterial State Index Project Summary  Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is the most devastating complication after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) and has an incidence rate of 30%. Current practice relies on intermittent assessment of neurological status and daily cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) by Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) to guide medical management to prevent DCI. Only after medical management fails, is endovascular treatment (EVT) including intraarterial vasodilator infusion and/or intracranial angioplasty initiated. This reactive practice does not account for early predictors of DCI and may miss the optimal EVT window at an early stage of DCI development before symptoms or severe deviations from normal hemodynamics. The goal of this project is to develop algorithms to predict DCI and related targets at an early stage in their development. An accurate prediction of DCI will enable a more proactive strategy to prevent and treat the underlying cause of DCI.  The following three aims will be pursued towards the goal of the project: 1) Develop aSAH-specific intracranial pressure (ICP) pulse-based cerebral arterial state index; 2) Develop and validate predictive models of targets related to delayed cerebral ischemia after aSAH; 3) Conduct a prospective institution- specific adaption and validation of the developed models.  Our DCI predictive algorithms only need data available in current clinical practice hence they can be readily adopted. If validated, these algorithms will enable clinicians to monitor risk of DCI continuously and to proactively deliver appropriate treatment. The proposed prospective study of algorithm implementation and adaptation will well prepare future clinical trials to test the efficacy of algorithm-informed interventions.

The goal of this project is to develop algorithms to predict DCI and other related targets at an early stage in their development to enable a more proactive strategy to prevent and treat the underlying cause of DCI.",Learning to Predict Delayed Cerebral Ischemia with Novel Continuous Cerebral Arterial State Index,10251348,R01NS113541,"['Algorithms ', ' Blood Flow Velocity ', ' Cerebrovascular Circulation ', ' brain blood flow ', ' cerebral blood flow ', ' cerebral circulation ', ' cerebrocirculation ', ' cerebrovascular blood flow ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complication ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Dilatation - action ', ' Dilatation ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Hydrocephalus ', ' Hydrocephaly ', ' hydrocephalic ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Intracranial Pressure ', ' Subarachnoid Pressure ', ' Learning ', ' Maps ', ' Physiologic Monitoring ', ' Physiological Monitoring ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vasodilator Agents ', ' Vasodilating Agent ', ' Vasodilator Drugs ', ' Vasodilators ', ' TimeLine ', ' Angioplasty ', ' intraluminal angioplasty ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Distal ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Transcranial Doppler Ultrasonography ', ' Doppler Transcranial Sonography ', ' transcranial doppler ultrasound ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Cerebrum ', ' cerebral ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' Cerebral perfusion pressure ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' Infusion ', ' Infusion procedures ', ' Performance ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' novel ', ' Appearance ', ' Neurologic status ', ' Neurological status ', ' Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhages ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cerebral Ischemia ', ' Pulse Pressure ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' electronic data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' vector ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prospective ', ' clinical practice ', ' efficacy testing ', ' constriction ', ' temporal measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' data streams ', ' ']",NINDS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,582524,NC-04
"Neuroinformatics platform using machine learning and content-based image retrieval for neuroscience image data This project aims to develop NeuroManager™, an innovative neuroinformatics platform for advanced parsing, storing, aggregating, analyzing and sharing of complex neuroscience image data. A core technology that we will develop in NeuroManager will be Image Content Analysis for Retrieval Using Semantics (ICARUS), a novel, intelligent neuroimage curation system that will enable image retrieval based on visual appearance or by semantic concept. ICARUS will use machine learning applied to content-based image retrieval - (CBIR) to build and refine models that summarize microscopic and macroscopic image appearance and automatically assign semantic concepts to neuroimages. Neuroscience research generates extensive, multifaceted data that is considerably under-utilized because access to original raw data is typically maintained by the source lab. On the other hand, there are many advantages in sharing complex image data in neuroscience research, including the opportunity for separate analysis of raw data by other scientists from another perspective and improved reproducibility of scientific studies and their results. Unfortunately, none of the neuroscience data sharing options that exist today fulfill all the needs of neuroscientists. To solve this problem, NeuroManager will include the following distinct, significant innovations: (i) versatility for handling two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional neuroimaging data sets from animal models and humans; (ii) functionality to share complex datasets that extends secure, privacy-controlled paradigms from institutional, laboratory-based and even public domains; (iii) flexibility to implement NeuroManager within an institute’s IT infrastructure, or on most cloud-based virtualized environments including Azure, Google Cloud Services and Amazon Web Services; (iv) and most importantly, the ICARUS technology for CBIR in neuroimaging data sets. The benefit of NeuroManager for the neuroscience research community, pharmacological and biotechnological R&D, and society in general will be to foster collaboration between scientists and institutions, promoting innovation through combined expertise in an interdisciplinary atmosphere. This will open new horizons for better understanding the neuropathology associated with several human neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions at various levels (i.e., macroscopically, microscopically, subcellularly and functionally), ultimately leading to an improved basis for developing novel treatment and prevention strategies for complex brain diseases. In Phase I we will prove feasibility of this novel technology by developing prototype software that will perform CBIR on 2D whole slide images of coronal sections of entire mouse brains from ongoing research projects of our collaborators. Work in Phase II will focus on developing the commercial software product that will include all of the innovations mentioned above. A competing technology with comparable functionality, addressing the full breadth of needs for modern neuroscience research, is currently not available commercially or otherwise. There are many advantages in sharing complex image data in neuroscience research, including the opportunity for separate analysis of raw data by other scientists from another perspective and improved reproducibility of scientific studies and their results; however none of the neuroscience data sharing options that exist today fulfill all the needs of neuroscientists.

"Use of Machine Learning on Integrated Electronic Medical Record, Genetic and Waveform Data to Predict Perioperative Cardiorespiratory Instability Project Summary/Abstract  The objective of this K01 application is to give Dr. Hofer the necessary training and research experience to establish himself as an independent investigator focused on using machine learning (ML) on a variety of healthcare data to predict outcomes during the perioperative period. The career development activities consist of escalating coursework on machine learning beginning with an online course of ML fundamentals and ending with a UCLA course on ML applications in healthcare. Augmenting these courses are tutorials on the application of these techniques to healthcare data and a research program is designed to use ML on healthcare data to predict perioperative cardio-respiratory instability (CRI) – specifically hypotension and arrhythmia.  To achieve these goals, Dr. Hofer has established an outstanding team of leaders in machine learning, perioperative medicine, and clinical informatics. Dr. Maxime Cannesson, his primary mentor, is an expert in perioperative medicine and the use of ML on physiologic signals. Dr. Eran Halperin, the co-mentor for this pro- posal, is an expert in ML and its application to genomic and other healthcare data. Dr. Hofer has ongoing collab- orations with Drs. Cannesson and Halperin on joint projects. Both Drs. Cannesson and Halperin have a strong track record of mentoring individuals who have progressed to independent and productive academic careers. Dr. Hofer will be aided by an advisory committee consisting of Dr. Douglas Bell (who will provide guidance on integrating data from multiple sources), Dr. Mohammed Mahbouba (providing support regarding data security and creating enterprise level analytic solutions) and Dr. Jeanine Wiener-Kronish (providing guidance on the most relevant questions in perioperative outcome prediction).  Challenges managing CRI have been implicated in the more than 15 million annual postoperative com- plications, costing more than $165 billion, however no scores exist to predict CRI. This study will leverage unique infrastructure at UCLA where whole EMR data has been combined with physiologic waveforms and genomic data on more than 30,000 patients. This proposal will use a variety of ML techniques on these data to create predictive models for CRI.  In summary, this proposal will provide Dr. Hofer with both technical training in ML and hands on experi- ence in using ML to predict perioperative outcomes. This study has the potential to create models that will help clinicians predict, and thus avoid, perioperative instability, thereby improving patient outcomes. Additionally, this program will provide Dr. Hofer with the tools he needs to successfully compete for a R01 focusing on using ML models on a variety of healthcare data to predict the downstream effects of CRI – perioperative complications. Project Narrative During the perioperative period hemodynamic instability is the norm rather than the exception; the ability of clinicians to manage this instability has been associated with postoperative complications affecting more than 15 million Americans and costing more than $165 billion each year. There are no current risk scores that predict instability in real time, however the recent widespread adoption of electronic medical records and creation of genomic biobanks creates unique opportunities to develop scores that are both accurate and precise. We will use machine learning techniques to create risk scores for perioperative cardiorespiratory instability – specifically hypotension and arrhythmia – using combined electronic medical record, genomic and physiologic waveform data.","Use of Machine Learning on Integrated Electronic Medical Record, Genetic and Waveform Data to Predict Perioperative Cardiorespiratory Instability",10247089,K01HL150318,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Arrhythmia ', ' Cardiac Arrhythmia ', ' Heart Arrhythmias ', ' Atlases ', ' California ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Hypotension ', ' Low Blood Pressure ', ' Vascular Hypotensive Disorder ', ' Inpatients ', ' Joints ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Manuals ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Modernization ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Postoperative Complications ', ' post-operative complications ', ' pressure ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' African American ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' Data Security ', ' Data awareness ', ' information security ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Latino ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' stress response ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Medical History ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' acute stress ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Genetic Data Banks ', ' Genetic Data Bases ', ' Genetic Databanks ', ' Genetic Information Databases ', ' Genetic Databases ', ' Genomics ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Population Analysis ', ' Subgroup ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Perioperative ', ' Process ', ' electronic data ', ' cost ', ' feeding ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Perioperative complication ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' genetic information ', ' online course ', ' E-course ', ' online curriculum ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' Infrastructure ', ' random forest ', ' long short term memory ', ' multiple data sources ', ' structured data ', ' phenotyping algorithm ', ' automated algorithm ', ' automatic algorithm ', ' diverse data ', ' data diversity ', ' prognostic model ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K01,2021,175284,CA-33
"Organ Procurement and Information Process Optimization Project Summary: Organ Procurement and Information Process Optimization A recent White House initiative titled Advancing American Kidney Health outlines the current administration's plans to increase the supply of kidneys in the US, along with other measures that attempt to correct the imbalance between supply and demand for kidneys. In alignment with this White House initiative, the principal investigator (PI) of this project will develop algorithms to assist Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs) make donor disposition decisions with the goal of increasing the supply of transplantable organs. The PI will harness the vast amount of data collected by OPOs, and customize as well as develop new Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) algorithms to identify good donors. These algorithms will reduce case coordinators workload and improve the accuracy of their decisions. The PI's objective is to quantity the impact of AI-assisted decision-making on increasing the supply of kidneys by ﬁnding missed opportunities on account of the current manual processes. Even a few more potential donors per OPO will help reduce the organ shortage problem when scaled to all 58 OPOs across the country.  This project will leverage unique data sets to generate and test hypotheses concerning which fac- tors aﬀect donor disposition decisions, and which information processing protocols produce greater referral-to-donor conversion rate. It will also customize classiﬁcation algorithms to assist case co- ordinators make donor disposition decisions. The focus will be on improving both the accuracy and speed of such decisions. As a follow up of this project, the PI will conduct a broader study involving at least ﬁve additional OPOs. The ﬁve OPOs will be selected to represent the diversity in size, population, and geography among the 58 OPOs across the country. Results of this and the follow-up study will be shared freely with all OPOs. The proposed research has the potential to increase the number of donors, free up staﬀ time, and lower OPO labor costs.  The potential impact of this project lies in the formulation and testing of hypotheses that can beneﬁt OPO decision-making and people on transplant wait list, customization of existing machine learning algorithms and computational techniques for sequential decision-making in a novel setting, and laying the groundwork for the development of new methods in the future.  The PI has the necessary disciplinary expertise, and management and leadership experience to succeed in the proposed eﬀorts. He has access to advanced computing resources and administrative help from the University of Texas. Finally, he has obtained the necessary IRB approval to proceed with this project. 1 Project Narrative: Organ Procurement and Information Process Optimization The widespread use of electronic medical record systems by hospitals, and electronic capture of referrals data by the organ procurement organizations (OPOs) makes it possible to harness large amounts of data to augment human decision-making and ask whether this can increase the supply of organs, speciﬁcally kidneys. The PI in this project will focus on improving the speed and accuracy of case coordinators' donor-disposition decisions by developing and testing customized machine learning and sequential decision-making algorithms using data from two OPOs. These eﬀorts will help quantify the potential beneﬁt of leveraging OPO data to increase kidney supply and pave the way for a larger study focusing on multiple OPOs.",Organ Procurement and Information Process Optimization,10246800,R03HS027671,[''],AHRQ,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R03,2021,58019,TX-10
"Global Health Catalyst (GHC) Summit Project Summary Recently, leaders in cancer policy from the USA and 14 economically diverse countries concluded that successful campaigns to control cancer will increasingly depend on concerted international collaborations. The recent World Health Organization Cancer Report highlights urgency for such international collaborations, with over 60% of 14 million new cancer cases and 70% of 8.2 million deaths per year occurring in low and middle income countries (LMIC), some of which, sadly, are the least capable of dealing with cancer without some form of collaboration. These major disparities in cancer deaths are in part a reflection of poignant underlying disparities in Radiation Oncology. For example, radiotherapy, which is needed in the treatment of over 50% of cancer patients, is not available in about half of Africa's 54 countries, and preliminary research shows major safety concerns in implementation of radiotherapy where available. The overall goal of this proposal is to organize yearly global health catalyst (GHC) cancer summits designed to catalyze high impact international collaborations between US and African Institutions to address the growing global burden of cancers, and associated disparities. This GHC summits, will build on the success and lessons learned over the past years during previously organized summits, that have catalyzed collaborations to support cancer healthcare institutions in different African countries, supported education and training efforts to build human/research capacity, and established fecund research collaborations, along with disease prevention and advocacy programs in global oncology. An innovative component of the summit is the focus on outreach engagement of under-represented minorities and the resource-laden Africans in Diaspora (AiD) to turn the devastating effects of brain drain to gain against cancer. Outcomes will include: new and strengthened collaborations involving partners from both USA and African institutions each year, significant increase in participation of under-represented minorities and diaspora in global oncology, peer-reviewed publications co-authored by both USA and African collaborators, joint patents resulting from research collaborations, and continuous growth to engage more participation from USA and African Institutions to address the growing global burden of cancer and associated disparities. Project Narrative The overall goal of this project is to organize Global Health Catalyst cancer summits which will catalyze sustainable high impact USA-Africa collaborations designed to significantly enhance cancer research and education benefiting both USA and African countries.

"Relationship between Glaucoma and the Three-Dimensional Optic Nerve Head Related Structure Project Summary Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness globally, and is characterized by optic nerve damage that leads to the death of retinal ganglion cells with accompanying visual field (VF) loss. The optic nerve head (ONH) is the site of injury to the optic nerve fibers and plays a central role in glaucoma pathogenesis and diagnosis. Traditionally, glaucoma is diagnosed based on fundus inspection of the ONH, which provides information about the surface contour of the ONH. However, the optic nerve damage occurs in the deeper layers. With the development of optical coherence tomography (OCT) techniques for three-dimensional (3D) retinal imaging, parameters derived from the 3D ONH related structure (e.g., Bruch's membrane opening minimum rim width, peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, disc tilt etc.) have been studied to better understand glaucoma pathogenesis, and are used to supplement clinical diagnosis. In addition, studies of the ONH biomechanics have also shown that the strain level at the ONH at any given intraocular pressure level depends on the 3D geometry of the ONH related structure. A high strain level is hypothesized to contribute to retinal ganglion cell injury. Previous research has suggested that the 3D ONH related structure is correlated to glaucoma pathogenesis and critically important to glaucoma diagnosis. However, to date, a systematic study using clinical data to determine the impact of the 3D ONH related structure on glaucoma has not been conducted.  We propose to study the relationship between the 3D ONH related structure and glaucoma with a diverse set of combined techniques including image processing, computational mechanics and machine learning. The specific aims of this project are to: (1) Derive features from the 3D ONH related structure and study their implications on VF loss patterns (K99 Phase). (2) Investigate the impact of the strain field patterns at the ONH on glaucoma (K99 Phase). (3) Study the effect of the 3D ONH related features on OCT diagnostic parameters (R00 Phase). (4) Model central vision loss from the 3D ONH related structural features (R00 Phase). Collectively, these studies will provide new insights and perspectives into the structure-function relationships in glaucoma and establish ocular anatomy specific norms of retinal nerve fiber layer profiles, which will advance our current understanding of glaucoma pathogenesis and improve glaucoma diagnosis. Our research is of high clinical relevance and can be potentially translated into clinical practice for better glaucoma diagnosis, monitoring and treatment.  Through the proposed research and training plans, the applicant will build a solid knowledge base in ophthalmology and further improve his expertise in mathematical modeling and data science. This project will provide critical training opportunities to further enhance the applicant's capabilities to become an independent computational vision scientist in ophthalmology.

"Bio-digital Rapid Alert to Identify Neuromorbidity The silent development and progression of neurologic morbidity, or neuromorbidity, among hospitalized, critically ill patients represents a newly recognized and emerging epidemic. This includes patients admitted to intensive care units with primary neurologic diagnoses, those at increased risk based on their underlying disease (e.g. neurotropic viral infections including COVID19), and those where the development of neuromorbidity is occult and unexpected. Neuromorbidity associated with critical illness can be caused by physiologic instability, biochemical derangements, side effects of medications, invasive mechanical support, immobility, and/or other therapies used to prevent death. It spans the age spectrum from neonates to the elderly, occurs across gender and race, and is underrecognized in patients with systemic illnesses (e.g. sepsis, viral infections, and other inflammatory conditions) and critical organ failure (e.g. acute respiratory distress syndrome, cancer, hepatic and renal failure). In the U.S. the incidence of neuromorbidity ranges from 5-47% in critically ill children and adults, thus impacting hundreds of thousands of patients annually. Often neuromorbidity evolves undetected until after clinical manifestations emerge and is irreversible. Neuromorbidity can strike acutely, e.g. seizures, stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, cerebral edema, and/or delirium, or in a more protracted fashion, e.g. neuromuscular weakness and/or cognitive decline, and is often permanent, endured throughout the remainder of a person’s lifetime. No standard clinical tool exists to identify patients at risk for neuromorbidity or for real-time neurologic monitoring, in stark contrast to the heart, kidney, liver, and many other organs.  To fill this gap and transform the way clinicians detect and monitor for evolving brain injury, we developed a Bio-digital Rapid Alert to Identify Neuromorbidity (BRAIN) that continuously feeds electronic health record (EHR) variables in 9 clinical domains (A through I) into proprietary informatics and machine learning platforms. Prototype BRAIN A-I models are robust and predict clinician concern for neuromorbidity before clinical action is taken. To link biological and digital signatures, we have defined a panel of serum biomarkers that can identify time-documented neuromorbidity before clinical detection. Using a “Bayesian to Bedside” approach, we have created a live data pipeline bridging the EHR and a dedicated host server, establishing the infrastructure necessary to operationalize BRAIN A-I as an embedded predictive analytic and decision-driving support tool.  In this proposal we will test the hypothesis that digital signatures in the EHR coupled with brain-specific biomarkers can rapidly detect neuromorbidity in critically ill children. Successful deployment of interoperable, 24/7 point-of-care neurologic monitoring for early detection of neuromorbidity would represent a breakthrough for the clinical management of critically ill patients. The silent development and progression of neurologic morbidity, or neuromorbidity, among hospitalized, critically ill patients represents a newly recognized and emerging epidemic. Despite this, no standard clinical tool exists to identify patients at risk for neuromorbidity or for real-time neurologic monitoring, in stark contrast to the heart, kidney, liver, and many other organs. To fill this gap and transform the way clinicians detect and monitor for evolving brain injury, we propose to validate and deploy a bio-digital process for 24/7 point-of-care neurologic monitoring for early detection of neuromorbidity in critically ill patients.",Bio-digital Rapid Alert to Identify Neuromorbidity,10313294,R01NS118716,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cerebral Edema ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Brain Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Parenchymal Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebrum Hemorrhage ', ' Intracerebral Hemorrhage ', ' Consultations ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Delirium ', ' delirious ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemic ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Heart ', ' Hospitals ', ' Pediatric Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Incidence ', ' Infant ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Pediatric Intensive Care Units ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Laboratories ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' ARDS ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' Adult ARDS ', ' Adult RDS ', ' Da Nang Lung ', ' Shock Lung ', ' Stiff lung ', ' wet lung ', ' Risk ', ' Seizures ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' viral infection ', ' virus infection ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' Gender ', ' Encephalopathies ', ' Liver Failure ', ' Hepatic Failure ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Blinded ', ' Caring ', ' Intracranial Hemorrhages ', ' Custom ', ' Critically ill children ', ' critically ill child ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Biochemical ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Link ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' brain damage ', ' brain-injured ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Inflammatory ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' functional status ', ' cohort ', ' Informatics ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Organ failure ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Feeds ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' point of care ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' neuromuscular ', ' vector ', ' neonate ', ' digital ', ' Sepsis ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' prospective ', ' Coupled ', ' interoperability ', ' neurotropic ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' support tools ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' specific biomarkers ', ' Infrastructure ', ' side effect ', ' data pipeline ', ' Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources ', ' FHIR ', ' COVID-19 ', ' COVID19 ', ' CV-19 ', ' CV19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' biomarker signature ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,651658,PA-18
"Personalizing AAV Management by Leveraging Big Data: Targeting Complication Clusters PROJECT SUMMARY ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a small vessel vasculitis associated with disease- and treatment-related complications that contribute to reduced quality of life and excess mortality compared to the general population. In the context of improving rates of flare and mortality with contemporary treatments, increasing attention is shifting to complications (e.g., renal failure, infection, cardiovascular disease) as clinically-relevant and patient-oriented outcomes. However, our understanding of how best to address and prevent complications is limited because they are typically studied in isolation from a “single disease framework.” We do not understand how complications tend to co-occur in individuals in complication clusters. Moreover, with several available treatment options for AAV, comparative effectiveness studies using real-world experience data and relevant outcomes like complication clusters are needed to guide treatment decisions in a manner that personalizes care, improves quality of life, and reduces mortality. However, we do not have the methods to accurately and efficiently assemble an AAV cohort using state-of-the-art algorithms that leverage heterogeneous claims and electronic health record (EHR) data. The aims of this proposal are to (1) apply advanced clinical informatics methods (i.e., machine learning and natural language processing) to identify AAV cases in big data to assemble a large cohort and (2) determine complication clusters in an AAV cohort by applying latent transition analysis. To achieve these aims, we will leverage methodologic expertise developed through collaborations established during the PI’s K23 and use a novel data source that includes EHR data linked to Medicare and Medicaid claims. The PI’s team has previously demonstrated that unstructured (i.e., free-text) EHR data can be used to study topics mentioned in clinical notes of AAV patients and that keywords in these notes can help identify AAV patients but neither machine learning nor sophisticated natural language processing have been previously used to identify AAV cases. In addition, our prior work has examined AAV complications in isolation (e.g., renal disease, cardiovascular disease) but here we seek to identify phenotypes of complications (complication clusters) that tend to co-occur in patients, how patients transition between clusters over time, and what factors predict a person’s membership in a complication cluster. The major goal of this proposal is to build further preliminary data in preparation for an R01 application over the next 24 months. The planned R01 will focus on comparative effectiveness studies in AAV using cohorts assembled in big data and clinically-relevant, patient-oriented outcomes, like complication clusters. The results of these studies can then be used as inputs in simulation models built during my K23 to guide optimal patient-oriented treatment decisions. Ultimately, the goal of this research program is to improve quality of life and reduce complications and mortality by using data to inform personalized approaches to AAV treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite treatment advances, ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) remains associated with disease- and treatment-related complications that contribute to a reduced quality of life and an increased risk of death compared to the general population. To further improve these outcomes, we need to understand which medications work best to treat AAV and this requires a large group of patients to study and a better understanding of complications in AAV. This R03 proposal focuses on applying advanced clinical informatics to assemble a large AAV cohort and characterizing how complications co-occur (i.e., complication clusters) in AAV.",Personalizing AAV Management by Leveraging Big Data: Targeting Complication Clusters,10198103,R03AR078938,"['Algorithms ', ' Attention ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Complication ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease Clusterings ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' disease of the lung ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Remission Induction ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Research ', ' Respiratory Tract Infections ', ' Respiratory Infections ', ' Rheumatism ', ' Musculoskeletal Pain Disorder ', ' Rheumatic Diseases ', ' Rheumatologic Disorder ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Time ', ' Vasculitis ', ' Angiitis ', ' vasculitides ', ' Work ', ' Excess Mortality ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies ', ' ANCA ', ' Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Collaborations ', ' Metabolic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Test Result ', ' respiratory ', ' experience ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Informatics ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' case finding ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Sampling ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Flare ', ' Preparation ', ' Modification ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' ANCA vasculitis ', ' ANCA associated vasculitis ', ' Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody associated vasculitis ', ' Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody vasculitis ', ' antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody associated vasculitis ', ' antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody vasculitis ', ' Outcome ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' person centered ', ' high risk ', ' Medicare claim ', ' patient population ', ' treatment strategy ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' compare efficacy ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized care ', ' Precision care ', ' individualized care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' personalized approach ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' precision approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' Treatment-related toxicity ', ' therapeutic toxicity ', ' therapy toxicity ', ' treatment toxicity ', ' improved outcome ', ' data resource ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' structured data ', ' unstructured data ', ' treatment comparison ', ' compare treatment ', ' comparative effectiveness study ', ' ']",NIAMS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R03,2021,105843,MA-08
"Detection and characterization of critical under-immunized hotspots Detection and characterization of critical under-immunized hotspots  Emergence of undervaccinated geographical clusters for diseases like measles has become a national concern. A number of measles outbreaks have occurred in recent months, despite high MMR coverage in the United States ( 95%). Such undervaccinated clusters can act as reservoirs of infection that can transmit the disease to a wider population, magnifying their importance far beyond what their absolute numbers might indicate. The existence and growth of such undervaccinated clusters is often known to public health agencies and health provider networks, but they typically do not have enough resources to target people in each such cluster, to attempt to improve the vaccination rate. Preliminary results show that not all undervaccinated clusters are “equal” in terms of their potential for causing a big outbreak (referred to as its “criticality”), and the rate of undervaccination in a cluster does not necessarily correlate with its criticality.  However, there are no existing methods to estimate the potential risk of such clusters, and to identify the most “critical” ones. Some of the key reasons are: (i) purely data-driven spatial statistics methods rely only on immunization coverage, which does not give any indication of the risk of an outbreak; and (ii) current causal epidemic models need to be combined with detailed incidence data, which has not been easily available.  This proposal brings together a systems science approach, combining agent-based stochastic epidemic models, and techniques from machine learning, high performance computing, data mining, and spatial statistics, along with novel public and private datasets on immunization and incidence, to develop a novel methodology for identifying critical clusters, through the following tasks: (i) Identify spatial clusters with signiﬁcantly low immunization rates, or strong anti-vaccine sentiment; (ii) Develop an agent based model for the spread of measles that incorporates detailed immunization data, and is calibrated using a novel source of incidence data; (iii) Develop methods to ﬁnd and characterize critical spatial clusters, with respect to different metrics, which capture both epidemic and economic burden, and order underimmunized clusters based on their criticality; and (iv) Use the methodology to evaluate interventions in terms of their effect on criticality. A highly interdisciplinary team involving two universities, a health care delivery organization and a state department of Health, will work together to develop this methodology. Characterization of such clusters will enable public health departments and policy makers in targeted surveillance of their regions and a more efﬁcient allocation of resources. Project Narrative  This project will develop a new methodology to quantify the potential risks of under-vaccinated spatial clusters for highly infectious diseases. It will rank the clusters based on their economic and epidemic burden which will enable public health ofﬁcials in targeted surveillance and interventions, to mitigate their risk.",Detection and characterization of critical under-immunized hotspots,10197938,R01GM109718,"['Affect ', ' California ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health delivery systems ', ' health services delivery ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease Clusterings ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Exhibits ', ' Geography ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Immunization ', ' Immunologic Sensitization ', ' Immunologic Stimulation ', ' Immunological Sensitization ', ' Immunological Stimulation ', ' Immunostimulation ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Measles ', ' Rubeola ', ' morbilli ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Minnesota ', ' New Jersey ', ' New York ', ' Oregon ', ' Privatization ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Registries ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' statistics ', ' Systems Analysis ', ' Systems Analyses ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine ', ' MMR Vaccine ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Bayesian Method ', ' Bayesian Methodology ', ' Bayesian Statistical Method ', ' Bayesian approaches ', ' Bayesian classification method ', ' Bayesian classification procedure ', ' Bayesian posterior distribution ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scanning ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' high-end computing ', ' High Performance Computing ', ' novel ', ' economic cost ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' health organization ', ' Herd Immunity ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Population Analysis ', ' Resolution ', ' Vaccinated ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Characteristics ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' demographics ', ' economic outcome ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' population based ', ' public health intervention ', ' social media ', ' Immunize ', ' provider networks ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' diverse data ', ' data diversity ', ' vaccine hesitancy ', ' hesitant to vaccination ', ' vaccination hesitancy ', ' vaccine hesitant ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2021,321062,VA-05
"A magnetic capsule endoscope for colonoscopy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease We propose to develop, optimize, and conduct first in-human measurements of our Magnetic Flexible Endoscope (MFE) robotic platform that may provide a safer and more intelligent alternative to standard colonoscopy (CLS) for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Patients with IBD are at increased risk for colorectal cancer and therefore surveillance has been recommended to occur at intervals less than that recommended for the general population. Thus, over the course of their lifetime, they are subjected to more frequent CLS than their non-lBD counterparts, resulting in a more than 6-fold increase in adverse events. The main risks of CLS are related to procedural sedation, patient discomfort, or perforation of the colon from looping. Looping and mesenteric stretching occur due to the design of the colonoscope. Special maneuvers can be performed to minimize looping, making CLS a procedure that requires a great degree of technical skill and experience to perform safely. By using the proposed robotic platform, the endoscopist will be able to control the motion of the MFE to perform navigation, diagnosis, and therapy (i.e. biopsy, polyp removal/retrieval, injection) inside the human colon. MFE motion is achieved by magnetic coupling between an external permanent magnet (attached to a robotic arm outside the patient's body) and an internal permanent magnet (located inside the proximal head of the MFE). A small-diameter flexible tether between the head of the endoscope and the distal control module (outside the patient's body) allows for passage of commercially available therapeutic tools, insufflation, irrigation, suction/aspiration, and electrical wiring. Employing magnetic attraction at the head of the endoscope, for advancement and manipulation, permits the tether to follow passively-reducing the risk of mesenteric stretching or looping when compared to the traditional colonoscope. We will leverage our experience and extensive preliminary results to test the hypotheses that (1) intelligent robotic control and assistive autonomy in endoscopic tasks improves endoscopic performance, (2) quantifying the portion of colon lumen visualized provides valuable feedback to improve MFE operation and diagnostic yield, and (3) that the MFE is safe and successfully functions in the human colon in a manner similar to conventional CLS. The investigative team, combining engineering and clinical faculty, is uniquely positioned to achieve success of this study-collectively possessing expertise in endoscopic device design, clinical CLS, assessment and validation of innovative gastrointestinal technologies, robotics, magnetism, image processing, artificial intelligence, and translation of research-engineering developments into clinical applications. Additionally, the investigators have a long-standing history of close and fruitful collaboration including R01 EB018992. If successful, this approach will demonstrate first in-human use of the MFE that reduces potential adverse events in an at-risk population (IBD patients), is intuitive to control, and integrates intelligent guidance into colon exploration and inspection. The robotic platform we propose has the potential to provide a safer, more accessible, and potentially painless alternative to standard colonoscopy for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Ulcerative Colitis or Crohn's disease)-a disease that impacts the lives of over three million Americans, who are at a 6-fold increased risk for post-colonoscopy adverse events when compared to their non-lBD counterparts. The platform uses magnetic actuation, intelligent closed-loop control, and integrated assistive autonomy of our diagnostic and therapeutic magnetic flexible endoscope (MFE) to facilitate intuitive endoscopist-directed motion under precise control with a novel colon-visualization-index (CVI) that provides feedback to the endoscopist with estimates of the portion of colon lumen successfully imaged to maximize the yield of exam.

"iGLAMOUR Study:  Innovations in Glaucoma Adherence and monitoring Of Under-Represented minorities PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Glaucoma affects more than 70 million people worldwide and is the world's leading cause of irreversible blindness. The only current method to delay its development and progression is by lowering intraocular pressure (IOP), achieved with topical administration of eyedrops. Adherence rates for glaucoma eyedrop administration are poor, in many cases below 50%, resulting in disease progression, eventual blindness, and a more than 2-fold increase in healthcare costs. African Americans and Latinos carry a significantly higher glaucoma burden compared with Caucasians. Minorities have additionally been found to have disproportionately lower rates of medication adherence. Previously studied interventions aimed at improving glaucoma adherence had key limitations that particularly affect minorities, including unreliable self-reported measures of adherence, lack of consideration of individual circumstances influencing glaucoma medication management, and developing/testing interventions in predominantly Caucasian populations. Health information technology has experienced rapid advancement in the last decade with the electronic health record (EHR), the proliferation of accessory mobile health technologies, and the advancement of artificial intelligence. Although their integration holds great promise to enable screening tools for diagnosis and risk prediction, successful integration to aid minority populations in real-world settings depends on: understanding how the collected information relates to the patient's other (e.g. clinical) data and the patient's socio-cultural context; seamless information exchange and interoperability with the EHR, the central portal of healthcare delivery; and integration of algorithmic findings into workflows involving both providers and patients to deliver information and/or recommendations in a simple, actionable manner. Glaucoma is a complex chronic disease, spanning decades of patients' lives and requiring ongoing monitoring and evaluation, thus making it an ideal application for the use of health IT to reduce racial disparities. In this proposal, we aim to accomplish this by: demonstrating the effectiveness of a flexible electronic eyedrop sensor to generate granular digital signatures of an individual's adherence and contextualizing this data in a socio- cultural context with patient interviews (Aim 1), combining adherence data with EHR variables to construct machine learning models to predict IOP control and enhance clinical risk stratification (Aim 2), and prototyping a dynamic dashboard for intervention coordination (Aim 3). Altogether, success of this innovative, comprehensive, culturally-tailored, and scalable health IT framework will improve medication adherence and slow disease progression among minorities, therefore narrowing this important racial health disparity. PROJECT NARRATIVE African Americans and Latinos carry a disproportionate burden of glaucoma, a blinding eye disease that can lead to severely decreased quality of life. Promoting adherence with topical medications that lower intraocular pressure, the primary therapeutic target for reducing the risk of glaucoma progression, represents a critical opportunity for technology-driven interventions. The iGLAMOUR (innovations in GLaucoma Adherence and Monitoring Of Under-Represented minorities) Study aims to develop and evaluate a health information technology framework incorporating flexible sensor electronics, machine learning-based predictive models, a patient- facing mobile interface, and a clinician-facing clinical dashboard to facilitate early identification and intervention for

"Predicting Epilepsy Surgery Outcomes Using Neural Network Architecture Abstract Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is one of the most common forms of pharmacologically resistant epilepsy. The resection or ablation of medial temporal structures can be curative for many patients. Unfortunately, approximately one third of patients who undergo TLE surgery continue to have disabling seizures post- procedurally. The reasons for suboptimal outcomes are not well understood and therefore constitute a very important knowledge gap in epilepsy care. A better understanding of this difference in surgical response phenotype could be used to improve surgical planning, treatment, outcome prediction and counseling. Promising preliminary studies suggest that TLE surgical outcomes can be inferred by neuroimaging computational tools assessing the cumulative degree of abnormalities in the topological organization of structural networks involving limbic and extra-limbic regions. Nonetheless, network abnormalities are not routinely or systematically used and quantified in the pre-surgical evaluation of epilepsies, and their assessment requires refinement and further validation. The purpose of this proposal is to perform a prospective study to test the hypothesis that the degree of limbic and extra-limbic network abnormalities in TLE, systematically assessed using a connectome approach based on optimized diffusion MRI (dMRI), can be used to predict and better understand epilepsy surgery outcomes. This hypothesis builds on the well-defined basic science and neurobiological premises that epilepsy is associated with pathological alterations in networks that are related to seizure onset and seizure propagation. Importantly, network abnormalities are not visible on routine MRI, but their detection using connectomes constitutes a modern approach to quantifying the location and magnitude of “lesional epilepsy,” where broad computational network abnormalities imply worse outcomes. We will prospectively gather clinical and imaging data at six epilepsy centers using the NIH epilepsy common data elements. This project will be fundamentally based on standard of care data, thus minimizing the burden of extra data collection and ensuring feasibility. Furthermore, this project will be embedded in the ENIGMA-Epilepsy framework, which is a collaborative platform for clinical and neuromaging multi-center research. Specific Aim 1 will define the accuracy, reproducibility, and predictive values of the pre-surgical dMRI tractography connectome model towards surgical results in TLE. We will perform hypothesis-driven tests of specific limbic and extra-limbic networks in relationship with clinical data and surgical outcomes. Specific Aim 2 will test if the neuroimaging-clinical outcome model can be further improved with advanced diffusion methods (multi-shell diffusional kurtosis imaging), resting state functional MRI networks, or a multimodal approach. We believe that this research will have an important impact on our understanding of the mechanisms related to TLE treatment. NARRATIVE While some patients can become seizure free with epilepsy surgery, others persist with disabling seizures and the reasons for vastly dissimilar outcomes are not well understood. Increasing evidence suggests that epilepsy-related neuronal network reorganization is at the core of the mechanisms underlying epilepsy severity and seizure control. This project will use individualized mapping of white matter neural networks to better understand the pathophysiology of epilepsy, identify reasons for treatment success, and guide strategies to improve surgical treatment.",Predicting Epilepsy Surgery Outcomes Using Neural Network Architecture,10158551,R01NS110347,"['Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Mapping ', ' Counseling ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diffusion ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electrocoagulation ', ' Electrocautery ', ' Endocavitary Fulguration ', ' Fulguration ', ' Galvanocautery ', ' Surgical Diathermy ', ' Thermocoagulation ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Tonic-Clonic Epilepsy ', ' Grand Mal Convulsions ', ' Grand Mal Epilepsy ', ' Grand Mal Seizure Disorder ', ' Major Epilepsy ', ' Major Motor Seizure Disorder ', ' Tonic Clonic Convulsions ', ' Tonic Clonic Seizure Disorder ', ' Tonic-Clonic Convulsion Disorder ', ' Tonic-Clonic Convulsion Syndrome ', ' Tonic-Clonic Seizure Syndrome ', ' Temporal Lobe Epilepsy ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Future ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Scalp structure ', ' Scalp ', ' Seizures ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Medial ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Refractory ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Lesion ', ' Fiber ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' millimeter ', ' Severities ', ' Contralateral ', ' Location ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Ablation ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' neuronal circuit ', ' neuronal circuitry ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Organization Charts ', ' organizational structure ', ' Modality ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Refractory epilepsy ', ' drug-resistant epilepsy ', ' Intractable Epilepsy ', ' Anterior Temporal Lobectomy ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Common Data Element ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' hippocampal atrophy ', ' hippocampal atropy ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' standard of care ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' connectome ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' tractography ', ' recruit ', ' surgery outcome ', ' surgical outcome ', ' neural network ', ' neural network architecture ', ' neural net architecture ', ' ']",NINDS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2021,638854,SC-01
"Accelerating viral outbreak detection in US cities using mechanistic models, machine learning and diverse geospatial data Project Abstract/Summary Our interdisciplinary research team will develop algorithms to accelerate the detection of respiratory virus outbreaks at an unprecedented local scale in US cities. We propose to advance outbreak detection by combining machine learning data integration methods and spatial models of disease transmission. The dynamic models that will be developed will provide mechanistic engines for distinguishing typical from atypical disease trends and the optimization methods evaluate the informativeness of data sources to achieve specified public health goals through the rapid evaluation of diverse input data sources. Working with local healthcare and public health leaders, we will translate the algorithms into user-friendly online tools to support preparedness plans and decision-making. Our proposed research is organized around three major aims. In Aim 1, we will apply machine learning and signal processing methods to build systems that track the earliest indicators of emerging outbreaks within seven US cities. We will evaluate non-clinical data reflecting early and mild symptoms as well as clinical data covering underserved communities and geographic and demographic hotspots for viral emergence. In Aim 2, we will develop sub-city scale models reflecting the syndemics of co-circulating respiratory viruses and chronic respiratory diseases (CRD) that can exacerbate viral infections. We will infer viral transmission rates and socio-environmental risk cofactors by fitting the model to respiratory disease data extracted from millions of electronic health records (EHRs) for the last nine years. We will then partner with clinical and EHR experts to translate our models into the first outbreak detection system for severe respiratory viruses that incorporates EHR data on CRDs. Using machine learning techniques, we will further integrate other surveillance, environmental, behavioral and internet predictor data sources to maximize the accuracy, sensitivity, speed and population coverage of our algorithms. In Aim 3, we will develop an open-access Python toolkit to facilitate the integration of next generation data into outbreak surveillance models. This project will produce practical early warning algorithms for detecting emerging viral threats at high spatiotemporal resolution in several US cities, elucidate socio-geographic gaps in current surveillance systems and hotspots for viral emergence, and provide a robust design framework for extrapolating these algorithms to other US cities. Project Narrative We will develop innovative algorithms for detecting emerging respiratory viruses within US cities. To do so, we will model the syndemic dynamics of respiratory viruses and chronic respiratory diseases and apply machine learning to combine geospatial data that track early indicators of emerging threats. Working with local public health and healthcare collaborators, we will translate this research into practical tools for addressing socio- geographic gaps in surveillance and accelerating the detection, prevention and mitigation of severe outbreaks.","Accelerating viral outbreak detection in US cities using mechanistic models, machine learning and diverse geospatial

"Focal nerve fiber layer reflectance analysis for glaucoma evaluation PROJECT SUMMARY Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness, and effective glaucoma management requires early detection. Nerve fiber layer (NFL) thickness measurement by optical coherence tomography (OCT) is useful for confirming the diagnosis of glaucoma, but its diagnostic sensitivity is not sufficient to be used alone for population-based screening.  NFL reflectivity is reduced in glaucoma subjects, presumably due to loss of axons and axonal microtubule content. But its diagnostic value is diminished by its dependence on the incident angle of the OCT beam, which is highly variable in routine clinical imaging. We hypothesize that the diagnostic accuracy can be boosted by reducing incidence angle effects with azimuthal filtering of NFL reflectance profile, and by analysis of focal rather than average reflectance changes. The preliminary result, bases on 100 normal and glaucoma eyes, showed that the diagnostic sensitivity was significantly improved from 71% for average NFL thickness to 97% for focal NFL reflectance loss in PG eyes, at a 99% specificity cutoff. We propose to validate this result in the large Advanced Imaging for Glaucoma (AIG) study dataset that comprises 249 perimetric glaucoma (PG), 252 pre-perimetric glaucoma (PPG), and 145 normal participants. The AIG study has an average follow-up of more than 4 years, which also allows assessment of the accuracy in predicting glaucoma progression. 1. Reproduce the high diagnostic accuracy of focal NFL reflectance loss analysis using the large AIG  dataset. If we could again demonstrate high diagnostic accuracy in the AIG dataset, especially in the PPG  and early PG subgroups, this could bring OCT glaucoma evaluation into the realm of population screening.  The primary performance metric will be the diagnostic sensitivity at a fixed 99% specificity cut point. 2. Use focal NFL reflectance loss to predict visual field (VF) conversion and progression. In the AIG  study, focal thinning of the macular ganglion cell complex (GCC) and peripapillary nerve fiber layer (NFL)  were found to be the best predictors of VF conversion (development of glaucomatous VF abnormality in an  eye with normal baseline VF) and progression (significant worsening of VF). We hypothesize that focal  NFL reflectance loss would have even better predictive accuracy. Predictive accuracy will be assessed  using the area under the receiver operating curve (AROC) and logistic regression (odds ratio). 3. Combine OCT reflectance and structural maps using machine learning to improve glaucoma  diagnostic accuracy. A combination of disc, peripapillary, and macular thickness parameters had  previously been shown to be synergistic, producing higher AROC than any single parameter. We  hypothesize that the addition of the novel NFL reflectance loss map to the set of input parameters will  further enhance the diagnostic accuracy of a machine learning algorithm. PROJECT NARRATIVE Nerve fiber layer (NFL) thickness using OCT is widely used in clinic for glaucoma diagnosis, but the diagnostic sensitivity is limited. Combination of NFL reflectivity and other structural OCT information promises to improve the diagnostic accuracy to a level where population-based screening would be feasible.",Focal nerve fiber layer reflectance analysis for glaucoma evaluation,10108277,R21EY032146,"['Algorithms ', ' Axon ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Glaucoma ', ' glaucomatous ', ' Incidence ', ' Maps ', ' Microtubules ', ' Micro-tubule ', ' Nerve Fibers ', ' Odds Ratio ', ' Cross-Product Ratio ', ' Relative Odds ', ' Risk Ratio ', ' Patients ', ' Retina ', ' Specificity ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Visual Fields ', ' eye field ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Evaluation ', ' ganglion cell ', ' gangliocyte ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Scanning ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Sampling ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Diagnostic Sensitivity ', ' Diagnostic Specificity ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Management ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' macula ', ' macular ', ' Population ', ' population based ', ' screening ', ' clinical imaging ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' ']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,192500,OR-03
"Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The long-term goal of our ongoing project, “Discovering and applying knowledge in clinical databases,” is to learn from data in the electronic health record (EHR) and to apply that knowledge to understand and improve health. The EHR, because of its broad capture of human health, greatly amplifies our ability to carry out observational research, opening the possibility of covering emerging problems, diverse populations, rare diseases, and chronic diseases in long-term longitudinal studies. Unfortunately, the strength of EHR data—its breadth and flexible nature—imposes additional challenges. We have found that the biggest challenge comes from the inaccuracy, incompleteness, complexity, and resulting bias inherent in the recording of the health care process. We previously showed that health care process bias exists to the extent, for example, that simple use of the data can create signals implying the opposite of what we know to be true. One of the most important factors is sparse, irregular sampling; we found that sampling bias can be reduced by reparameterizing time and that prediction techniques that can accommodate EHR-specific data and resist their biases like data assimilation can be used on EHR data to produce good estimates of glucose and HA1c. The previous cycle of this project produced 75 publications. We propose to develop methods to accommodate health care process bias, using both knowledge engineering and experience with health care process bias as well as advanced statistical techniques that employ dynamical models and latent variables. We hypothesize that heuristics and models combined with knowledge can improve our ability to generate inferences and learn phenotypes despite health care process bias. Our aims are as follows: (1) Taking a knowledge engineering approach, study the effect of preprocessing and analytic choices on reducing health care process bias, and using machine learning techniques, learn more about health care process bias. (2) Taking a more empirical approach, use dynamic latent factor modeling and variation inference to accommodate health care process bias, learning how a patient's health state and health processes affect censoring, exploiting information from many variables at once. (3) Use data assimilation and mechanistic models to learn otherwise unmeasurable physiologic phenotypes despite irregular, sparse sampling typical of electronic health records. (4) Use the developed models and generated phenotypes to answer clinical questions, and disseminate the results. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project studies the biases that health care processes bring to electronic health record data, and it develops methods to overcome those biases to improve reuse of the data for purposes such as clinical research and quality improvement.",Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases,10116464,R01LM006910,"['abstracting ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Award ', ' Sampling Biases ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Engineering ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Insulin ', ' Humulin R ', ' Novolin R ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Learning ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Assimilations ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Nonlinear Dynamics ', ' Non-linear Dynamic ', ' Non-linear Dynamics ', ' Nonlinear Dynamic ', ' Training ', ' Measurement ', ' Active Learning ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' heuristics ', ' Orphan Disease ', ' Rare Disorder ', ' orphan disorder ', ' Rare Diseases ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Data ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' deep learning ', ' clinical database ', ' data reuse ', ' data re-use ', ' Drug Side Effects ', ' ']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,568584,NY-13
"Big Data Methods for Comprehensive Similarity based Risk Prediction Project Summary Electronic health records (EHR) provide rich source of data about representative populations and are yet to be fully utilized to enhance clinical decision-making. Conventional approaches in clinical decision-making start with the identification of relevant biomarkers based on subject-matter knowledge, followed by detailed but limited analysis using these biomarkers exclusively. As the current scientific literature indicates, many human disorders share a complex etiological basis and exhibit correlated disease progression. Therefore, it is desirable to use comprehensive patient data for patient similarity. This proposal focuses on deriving a comprehensive and integrated score of patient similarity from complete patient characteristics currently available, including but not limited to 1) demographic similarity; 2) genetic similarity; 3) clinical phenotype similarity; 4) treatment similarity; and 5) exposome similarity (here exposome defined as all available attributes of the living environment an individual is exposed to), when some of the aspects may overlap and interact. We will optimize information fusion and task-dependent feature selection for assessing patient similarity for clinical risk prediction. Since currently there does not exist a pipeline that is able to extract executable complete patient determinant data, to achieve the research goal described above, we propose first deliver an open- source data preparation pipeline that is based on a widely used clinical data standard, the OMOP (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership) Common Data Model (CMD) version 5.2. Moreover, to mitigate common missingness and sparsity challenges in clinical data, we describe the first attempt to represent patients' sparse clinical information with missingness, including diagnosis information, medication data, treatment intervention, with a fixed-length feature vector (i.e. the Patient2Vec). This project has four specific aims. Aim 1 is to develop a clinical data processing pipeline for harmonizing patient information from multiple sources into a standards-based uniformed data representation and to evaluate its efficiency, interoperability, and accuracy. Aim 2 is to leverage a powerful machine learning technique, Document2Vec, from the natural language processing literature, to create an open-source Patient2Vec framework for the derivation of informative numerical representations of patients. Aim 3 is to develop a unified machine learning clinical- outcome-prediction framework for Optimized Patient Similarity Fusion (OptPSF) that integrates traditional medical covariates with the derived numerical patient representations from Patient2Vec (Aim 2) for improved clinical risk prediction. Aim 4 is to evaluate our similarity framework for predicting 1) the risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in general EHR patient population and 2) the risk of death among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The project focus on developing a novel data science pipeline which includes a clinical data processing pipeline to format comprehensive patient health determinants from a variety of sources of clinical, genomic, socioenvironmental data, and a clinical-outcome-prediction framework that optimally fuses relevant patient health determinants to define patient similarity for improved clinical risk predictions.",Big Data Methods for Comprehensive Similarity based Risk Prediction,10087958,R01LM013061,"['Automation ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Literature ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Individual ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Informatics ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Preparation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Derivation procedure ', ' Derivation ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Health Professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' vector ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' biomed informatics ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' interoperability ', ' open source ', ' patient population ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' clinical risk ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' health data ', ' support tools ', ' Data Science ', ' open data ', ' open science ', ' open-source data ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' clinical decision support ', ' Big Data Methods ', ' Big Data Analytics ', ' Big Data Tools ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' data analysis pipeline ', ' data processing pipeline ', ' feature selection ', ' data standards ', ' data standardization ', ' patient health information ', ' patient health record ', ' patient medical record ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,455669,NY-13
"Machine Learning of Physiological Waveforms and Electronic Health Record Data to Predict, Diagnose, and Treat Hemodynamic Instability in Surgical Patients Project Summary / Abstract If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) during surgery, then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve postoperative outcome and more effectively use healthcare resources. But signs of shock often occur late once organ injury is already present. The goal of this proposal is to develop, validate, and test real-time intraoperative risk prediction tools based on electronic health record (EHR) data and high-fidelity physiological waveforms to predict CRI and make the databases of intraoperative data and waveforms used for these developments freely accessible. This is extremely relevant because although 5.7 million Americans are admitted to an Intensive Care Units (ICU) in one year, more than 42 millions undergo surgery annually. Previous and ongoing studies conducted in the ICU and in the step down unit have built the architecture to collect real-time high-fidelity physiological waveform data streams and integrate them with patient demographics from the EHR to build large data sets, and derive actionable fused parameters based on machine learning (ML) analytics as well as display information in real time at the bedside to drive clinical decision support (CDS) in the critical care setting. The goal of this proposal is to apply these ML approaches to the complex and time compressed environment of high-risk surgery where greater patient and disease variability exist and shorter period of time is available to deliver truly personalized medicine approaches. The work will be initiated using an already existing annotated intraoperative database from the University of California Irvine including EHR and high-fidelity waveform data. This operating room database already exists and needs only to be extracted. This data will be used for the initial training and development of the ML model that will then be tested on prospectively collected University of California Los Angeles and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center databases. Simultaneously, this approach will use existing knowledge of CRI patterns derived from previous step down unit / intensive care unit cohorts, MIMIC II data, University of California Irvine data, and animal studies to create smart alarms and graphic user interface for clinical decision support based on functional hemodynamic monitoring principles. The next step will then leverage the focus on the issues and strengths of the intraoperative environment, some of which can be listed as: 1) Known patients characteristics before surgery to define pre-stress baseline, allowing functional hemodynamic monitoring stress evaluations, preconditioning, and other preoperative calibrations, 2) High degree of direct observation and data density during most phases of surgery allowing close semi-autonomous monitoring and titration of novel treatment algorithms early, 3) Defined stages in the initial part of surgery (induction, intubation, skin incision) allowing ML approaches to build large common relational database registries, and 4) Defined surgical procedure and stressors (anesthesia induction, intra-abdominal air insufflation, and other surgery-specific interventions), which will alter the impact of CRI on measured variables. Project Narrative The purpose of this study is to first develop multivariable models through data-driven classification techniques to predict parsimoniously cardiorespiratory instability, etiology and response to treatment in patients undergoing high-risk surgery. Using high-fidelity intraoperative physiological waveform data augmented with extensive electronic health record derived annotation and applying machine learning approaches we will characterize and quantify common patterns in subjects destined to develop cardiorespiratory instability during high-risk surgery. We will use these inputs in simulated real-time bedside management to develop an iteratively designed prototype clinical decision support system suitable for intraoperative care.","Machine Learning of Physiological Waveforms and Electronic Health Record Data to Predict, Diagnose, and Treat Hemodynamic Instability in Surgical Patients",10086996,R01HL144692,"['clinical risk ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' support tools ', ' predictive tools ', ' clinical decision support ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' neural network algorithm ', ' surgical risk ', ' surgery risk ', ' data streams ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' organ injury ', ' injury to organs ', ' simulation environment ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' Air ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anesthesia procedures ', ' Anesthesia ', ' Animals ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Calibration ', ' California ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Critical Care ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hypotension ', ' Low Blood Pressure ', ' Vascular Hypotensive Disorder ', ' Insufflation ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Intraoperative Care ', ' Peroperative Care ', ' intra-operative care ', ' Intraoperative Period ', ' intra-operative period ', ' Intubation ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Los Angeles ', ' mortality ', ' Operating Rooms ', ' Pathologic Processes ', ' Pathological Processes ', ' Patients ', ' Postoperative Complications ', ' post-operative complications ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative ', ' pressure ', ' Recommendation ', ' Registries ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resuscitation ', ' Running ', ' Shock ', ' Circulatory Collapse ', ' circulatory shock ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Hospital Mortality ', ' In-house Mortalities ', ' Inhospital Mortality ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Titrations ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Surgical incisions ', ' Otomy ', ' incision ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' stressor ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' preconditioning ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' model development ', ' Skin ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Data ', ' Intra-abdominal ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Perioperative ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' electronic data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' data integration ', ' information display ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' interoperability ', ' data structure ', ' graphical user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' software user interface ', ' iterative design ', ' demographics ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' database structure ', ' data base structure ', ' relational database ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,734363,CA-33
"SCH: Active Learning for Medical Applications Cancer is considered one of the most dilapidating health problems that the world is facing due to its physical, emotional, financial, and spiritual toll. Automating cancer diagnosis can ultimately impact its treatment and recovery. Computational algorithmic methods can greatly improve the efficiency of pathologists through partial or complete automation of the diagnostic process. Computer-aided diagnosis has augmented preventive check-ups for many medical conditions like breast cancer, colonic polyps, and lung cancer. Digitization of tissue slides has thus opened up the process of diagnosis through analysis of digital images. The dearth of highly trained pathologists who can address the growing diagnostic needs heightens the importance of such automation. Recent advances in big data analytics and in particular machine learning can possibly impact greatly the domain of computer-aided cancer diagnosis. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in particular have already revolutionized the domain of computer vision with performances in various cases compared to that exhibited by humans. One of the main factors that fueled the recent resurgence of CNNs is the availability of large datasets. CNNs adjust, via training, millions of parameters allowing them to learn complex and highly nonlinear dependencies among data (i.e., images). However, collecting such large amounts of annotated data (assigning them to one of many possible categories, e.g., benign vs. cancerous vs. other stages) is either challenging or very expensive or in many cases unavailable. This is definitely the case of the medical domain. Tissue slides from suspected cancerous regions are examined under a microscope and are classified as benign or malignant. CNNs offer a promising pathway to achieve some degree of automation in identifying cancerous cases in image data. This research work will explore the challenges· of discovering the underlying discriminative features, hidden in the image and possibly different than those used by human experts, in order to improve the accuracy of diagnosis. We will also focus on algorithms to minimize the amount of data required to train the neural network without sacrificing performance and generalization. Cancer has been a major health concern and one of the leading causes of death in the US and around the world. Automating cancer diagnosis can impact cancer staging and ultimately its treatment, effectively leading to higher survival rates.

"Leveraging Social Media to Identify and Connect Teens with Eating Disorders to a Mobile Guided Self-Help Mobile Intervention Project Summary Clinical or subclinical eating disorders (EDs) impact 10% of individuals in their lifetime and are marked by significant functional impairment, early mortality, chronicity, and emotional distress. ED symptoms often emerge in adolescence, with peak onset age in the teenage years. Early recognition and treatment of these devastating illnesses are needed to prevent long-term consequences and a chronic course. Most (80%) individuals with EDs, including teens with EDs (TwEDs), do not receive treatment. Due to major barriers to access and to the delivery of treatment for TwEDs, there is a need for a new model of service delivery that can identify and help TwEDs. We have studied ED-related networking on social media and have demonstrated our ability to harness social media, which is used ubiquitously among teens, to identify and efficiently recruit large numbers of TwEDs. At the same time, our team has successfully developed a guided self-help cognitive- behavioral therapy (CBT)-based mobile app, StudentBodies-Eating Disorders (SB-ED), which includes personalized coaching and interactive sessions to address key ED treatment targets and has demonstrated efficacy among college women with EDs. This tool has great potential to be adapted to address the specific needs of TwEDs. In Aim #1 of the proposed study, we will update and adapt SB-ED to create #ByeED for TwEDs by 1) simplifying language and making content relevant to adolescent issues, 2) including a rewards feature to motivate continued app use, 3) including a within-app social networking feature to facilitate group exchanges and coach-led weekly group sessions, and 4) harnessing machine learning to digest users’ social networking data within #ByeED to respond to potential recovery setbacks in real-time and tailor coaching interactions. Following a small focus group of TwEDs to assess initial impressions of the app, #ByeED will be piloted among 20 TwEDs recruited from Instagram, garnering feedback via a mixed methods approach on the efficiency, technical effectiveness, and satisfaction with #ByeED. The app will be further refined for a small pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Aim #2, where we will again leverage Instagram for recruitment of TwEDs who are not engaged in treatment. This RCT will approximate the preliminary effectiveness of #ByeED (n=50) versus a control group (encouraging in-person treatment in their communities, n=50) in reducing ED symptoms, improving quality of life, increasing uptake of care, and impacting targets that are associated with outcomes. We will explore within-app predictors of outcomes, potential moderators of treatment effects (e.g., psychiatric comorbidity), and participant perspectives on potential additional parental involvement in #ByeED. Effect size and attrition estimates will aid in the planning of a larger RCT (R01 mechanism) where we will further expand #ByeED (e.g., automated coaching, parental involvement) and test the app on a larger scale to improve its potential to reduce the extraordinary burden of EDs among teens. Relevance to Public Health Eating disorders often emerge in adolescence and most of these teens do not receive treatment. We will use social media to reach teens networking about eating disorder behaviors and test a mobile app specifically developed for teens, including a social networking component, to help reduce eating disorder symptoms and improve their quality of life. We will also obtain teen perspectives on acceptable approaches to include parents in this intervention to inform a future version of the app.",Leveraging Social Media to Identify and Connect Teens with Eating Disorders to a Mobile Guided Self-Help Mobile Intervention,10085684,R34MH119170,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Anxiety ', ' Body Image ', ' body perception ', ' Body Weight ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Control Groups ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating Disorders ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Language ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Parents ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rewards ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' satisfaction ', ' uptake ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' restraint ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' interest ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' preference ', ' impression ', ' self help ', ' Participant ', ' behavioral test ', ' behavior test ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' feeling distress ', ' feeling upset ', ' emotional distress ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' DSM-5 ', ' DSM5 ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-V ', ' DSM-V ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Update ', ' Teenagers ', ' Teen ', ' teen years ', ' teenage ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' parental involvement ', ' treatment effect ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile device application ', ' individualized medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapeutic strategy ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' social media ', ' reduced food intake ', ' eat less ', ' reduced eating ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' recruit ', ' Service delivery model ', ' Service model ', ' care delivery model ', ' health care delivery model ', ' healthcare delivery model ', ' barrier to care ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' service delivery ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' acceptability and feasibility ', ' digital health ', ' dietary ', ' ']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R34,2021,232006,MO-01
"Prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease by Simulation Modeling to Improve the Health of Minority Populations Project Summary/Abstract Significant health disparities exist in chronic kidney disease (CKD), CKD progression, and end stage renal disease (ESRD) in ethnically diverse populations. African Americans (AAs) have ~25% higher prevalence of CKD, 3-fold higher rate of ESRD, and the highest risk of mortality among those with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 45-95mL/min/1.73m2. The most significant traditional risk factors for CKD and ESRD are diabetes and hypertension accounting for >60% CKD and >70% of new ESRD cases, respectively. Non- traditional risk factors for CKD such as environmental, cultural-behavioral factors, geographic, education, insurance coverage, socioeconomic status and unequal access to optimal healthcare, disproportionately affect CKD health in ethnic minorities. The unique combination of these factors on CKD progression in the real world remains poorly defined. Identification of modifiable risk factors that may reduce CKD disparities would be invaluable to improve quality of life, life expectancy, and decrease economic burden. Simulation models have been successfully applied in other clinical domains, but are limited in CKD development and CKD progression, due to small datasets and the absence of modeling techniques using longitudinal observational health data. Further, no models have been tested in a real-world minority population to uncover the potential for interventional studies that would reduce CKD disparities on a larger scale. To our knowledge, we have created the largest, comprehensive database from electronic health records of >10 million individuals seen between 2006-2016 from a 2-year partnership between UCLA (1.8 million) and Providence St. Joseph Health (PSJH; 9.2 million) systems. From the UCLA Registry population, we identified significant differences in eGFR trajectory decline between AAs and non-AAs according to baseline eGFR, indicating a pattern shift from a higher to a lower, steeper eGFR trajectory suggesting there may be critical windows for interventions to reduce CKD disparities in AAs. Race/ethnicity differences from linear mixed models of all ethnic cohorts persisted even after controlling for demographic and clinical variables known to influence eGFR trajectories. We hypothesize that the use of ethnically diverse populations in the joint UCLA PSJH CKD/At-risk CKD Registry can identify a novel combination of CKD risk factors; and improve the performance of existing simulation models to predict CKD progression. The specific aims are to: 1) develop and test a machine learning-based simulation model for CKD and eGFR trajectories using the UCLA PSJH CKD/At-risk CKD Registry; and conduct internal validation of the models and comparisons with existing CKD risk models, 2) stratify and test simulation models based on different racial/ethnic groups, including external validation based on cross-institution comparisons, and 3) conduct focus groups with UCLA primary care physicians, who manage racial/ethnic patients, to elicit their perspectives on existing and designed simulation models to reduce CKD health disparities. These innovative approaches will facilitate our long-term goal to inform clinical decision support methods to reduce/eliminate CKD health disparities. Project Narrative Disparities in chronic kidney disease (CKD) disproportionately affect the development of CKD and CKD progression in ethnic minorities. The ability to use large datasets of patient information to reduce these disparities is greatly lacking. We will conduct simulation modeling to identify a unique set of risk factors that predict CKD and CKD progression, that can be targeted for individualized treatment in patients with highest risk of kidney function decline, with valuable input on the potential utility of this resource from focus groups consisting of primary care physicians.",Prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease by Simulation

"Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years in the U.S., problems associated with opioid prescriptions, including non-medical use and overdose, increased to historically unprecedented levels and represent a public health crisis. Emergency departments (EDs) play an important role in opioid prescribing, particularly to individuals at high risk for adverse opioi-related outcomes. Half of all ED visits are for a painful condition, and one third of all ED visits result in an opioid being prescribed. Moreover, in our pilot work, a quarter of patients surveyed at the ED study site reported non-medical opioid use in the prior three months. Despite the importance of this problem, strategies to reduce non-medical opioid use after an ED visit have not been well-studied. Our recent trial of a motivational intervention delivered to patients in the ED by a therapist resulted in modest reductions in non- medical use after the ED visit compared to a control condition. However, the intervention was unable to address the implications of opioids prescribed as a result of the ED encounter on post-ED opioid use behavior. This project will adapt the intervention for delivery after the ED visit through mobile technology in order to directly address the use of ED-provided opioids. Patients (n=600) will be recruited during an ED visit for a randomized controlled trial of the adapted intervention based on having used opioids non-medically in the prior three months and being given an opioid by an ED prescriber. In the intervention condition, interactive voice response calls will repeatedly assess non-medical opioid use and pain level and deliver intervention content. The intervention will include several potential actions that vary in intensity: assessment only, a brief message, extended messaging, or connection to a therapist by phone. Because the most helpful intensity of intervention is unknown and likely to vary between patients, the project will use an artificial intelligence stratey called reinforcement learning (RL). The RL system will continuously ""learn"" from the success of prior actions in similar situations with similar patients in order to select the action most likelyto reduce non-medical opioid use for each participant during each call. The RCT will be complemented by qualitative interviews to inform later implementation. The specific aims are to: (1) Adapt and enhance an existing motivational intervention to decrease non-medical opioid use after an ED visit by optimizing intervention intensity and duration through RL; (2) Examine the impact of the intervention on non-medical opioid use level during the six months post-ED visit; (3) Examine the impact of the intervention on driving after opioid use, overdose risk behaviors, and subsequent opioid-related ED visits. Secondary Aims are: (1) to examine differences in intervention effects between participants with high and low baseline levels of non-medical opioid use; and (2) to understand barriers and facilitators of implementation. This project will use a highly innovative strategy, artificial intelligence, to address a highly significant problem, non-medical opioid use. Ultimately, this study can lead to reductions in opioid- related harms and move forward the field of mobile health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Non-medical use of opioid pain medications has increased substantially over the last decade, and ensuring the safe use of opioids prescribed as part of medical care has become a critical public health priority. Emergency Departments (EDs) are on the front lines of this emerging public health problem. This randomized controlled trial will test the impact of a mobile health intervention, which incorporates an innovative artificial intelligenc component to determine intervention duration and intensity, on non-medical opioid use and related harms for adult ED patients treated with opioids and who have a history of non-medical opioid use.",Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention,10098312,R01DA039159,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Opioid Analgesics ', ' opiate analgesia ', ' opiate analgesic ', ' opiate pain medication ', ' opiate pain reliever ', ' opioid analgesia ', ' opioid anesthetic ', ' opioid pain medication ', ' opioid pain reliever ', ' opioid painkiller ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Behavior ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Future ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Methodology ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Overdose ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Public Health ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Opioid ', ' Opiates ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Severities ', ' System ', ' Co-ordination disorder ', ' Coordination Disorder ', ' Dyscoordination ', ' Incoordination ', ' Lack of Coordination ', ' Abnormal coordination ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Reporting ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Emergency Care ', ' ED care ', ' ER care ', ' Emergency Department care ', ' Emergency Room care ', ' Emergency health care ', ' Emergency healthcare ', ' Emergency medical care ', ' post intervention ', ' drugged driving ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' motivational intervention ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' intervention effect ', ' brief motivational intervention ', ' clinical practice ', ' nonmedical use ', ' non-medical use ', ' public health priorities ', ' prescription opioid ', ' licit opioid ', ' opiate medication ', ' opioid medication ', ' prescribed opiate ', ' prescribed opioid ', ' prescription opiate ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' screening ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' Emergency Department patient ', ' ED patient ', ' ER patient ', ' Emergency Room patient ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' individualized medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapeutic strategy ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' learning progression ', ' continuous learning ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile technology ', ' opioid use ', ' opiate consumption ', ' opiate drug use ', ' opiate intake ', ' opiate use ', ' opioid consumption ', ' opioid drug use ', ' opioid intake ', ' opioid therapy ', ' opiate therapy ', ' recruit ', ' overdose risk ', ' opioid misuse ', ' non-medical opioid use ', ' nonmedical opioid use ', ' opiate misuse ', ' comparison intervention ', ' compare intervention ', ' clinical encounter ', ' implementation intervention ', ' implementation facilitators ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,552775,MI-12
"Model Development for Prediction of Surgical Outcome in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Patients: Incorporation of the Correlation between Post-Surgical Reorganization Phenotypes and Pre-Surgical Data Project Summary For epileptic patients who undergo brain resection or ablation interventions, it is the postoperative brain that will dictate seizure status, whether controlled or relapsed. Yet, it is data from the preoperative brain that drives the postoperative prediction process – a critical process for both patient and doctor, and one that is only clinically meaningful when seizure outcomes are predicted presurgically to optimize surgical-decision making. Accordingly, we propose to develop a multi-step model that will establish more accurate predictors of post- surgical seizure outcome in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) emphasizing post-surgical status, for it is the areas of the brain spared during surgery that form the neural substrates generating postoperative seizures. A second perspective motivating our project is the need to identify those changes in functional and structural brain network organization that support adaptive versus maladaptive seizure outcomes following brain surgery. These are the network changes (e.g., the new seizure generators) that dispose and place a potential surgical candidate on a specific outcome trajectory. Therefore, identifying the phenotypes of brain reorganization and change, and incorporating their status into presurgical predictive models of outcome will likely prove crucial to enhancing our ability to predict postoperative neuroplastic responses. While existing outcome prediction models in TLE have focused on clinical variables (e.g., lesional status), we choose instead to focus on structural and functional measures of network reorganization (communication dynamics, regional interactions, structural control). This stems from our belief that capturing network changes throughout the whole postsurgical brain offers a better practical method for identifying and predicting the latent seizure foci (epileptogenesis) that will emerge after surgery. Through machine learning techniques we will deliver an algorithm to be used with new, potential surgical patients, an algorithm that utilizes solely presurgical data, but incorporates our innovative prediction about postsurgical brain organization. Accordingly, our approach provides both a methodologic and conceptual (reorganization phenotypes) advance. The scientific premise leading to our hypotheses is that the failure in the literature to account for the impact of unresected/ablated brain regions, and the brain reorganizations these areas compel, has seriously impeded the predictive power of previous outcome models. Project Narrative For epileptic patients undergoing brain surgery, it is the postoperative brain that will dictate whether seizures are controlled or not. Accordingly, we propose to develop a model that predicts post-surgical seizure outcome in temporal lobe epilepsy, emphasizing the reorganization and change in brain network communication and control that comes with post-surgical status, for it is these features that will actually generate postsurgical seizures. Our innovation is the use of post-operative brain reorganization phenotypes to predict on a presurgical basis who will be disposed to a good vs poor outcome trajectory, highlighting that it is the failure to account for the impact of spared regions, and the brain organization changes these compel, which has seriously impeded the predictive power of prior outcome models.",Model Development for Prediction of Surgical Outcome in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Patients: Incorporation of the Correlation between Post-Surgical Reorganization Phenotypes and Pre-Surgical Data,10134456,R01NS112816,"['Algorithms ', ' Belief ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Generalized Epilepsy ', ' Generalized Seizure Disorder ', ' Temporal Lobe Epilepsy ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' central nervous system plasticity ', ' neural plasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Relapse ', ' Rest ', ' Seizures ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Organizational Change ', ' base ', ' brain surgery ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Lesion ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Ablation ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' model development ', ' Brain region ', ' Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' Output ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Epileptogenesis ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' stem ', ' standard measure ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' recruit ', ' surgery outcome ', ' surgical outcome ', ' random forest ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' ']",NINDS,THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,442761,PA-03
"Improving Outcomes Assessment in Chronic Graft versus Host Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can cure many hematologic cancers and other life- threatening hematologic diseases but 20-50% of survivors develop chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in transplant survivors. Chronic GVHD is an iatrogenic complication that can affect multiple organs, leading to clinical manifestations similar to autoimmune diseases such as systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren’s syndrome, and lichen planus. Chronic GVHD requires prolonged treatment with potent immunosuppressive agents and is associated with high symptom burden and poor quality of life. The precise pathophysiology is unclear in humans. There are data supporting involvement of T and B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, cytokines, chemokines and other proteins. However, information is derived from studies with few patients having heterogeneous clinical manifestations. This renewal application will address key gaps in our understanding: Can we identify biologically relevant cGVHD subgroups by studying large numbers of patients and using sophisticated analytic techniques to identify “clusters” of similar patients? Is personalized medicine possible based on knowledge of underlying pathophysiology and the likelihood of response? To address these questions, we will use our extensive biorepository to test whether plasma proteins and peripheral blood cellular populations cluster with clinical manifestations. While these studies are ongoing, a new cohort will be enrolled to prospectively test the cluster findings and to investigate early biomarkers for treatment response. Participants will be enrolled prior to starting a new systemic initial or second-line cGVHD treatment, then followed at 1, 3 and 6 months later to assess clinical response. Successful completion of these aims will advance our understanding of the biologic underpinnings of the different forms of human cGVHD and guide therapeutic approaches, in order to decrease the morbidity and mortality of this common transplant complication. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is the leading cause of morbidity and non-relapse mortality in survivors of allogeneic transplantation. Our understanding of the biologic abnormalities associated with different clinical phenotypes is lacking, preventing our ability to rationally choose cGVHD treatments.

"Patient-Generated Health Data to Predict Childhood Cancer Survivorship Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  There are approximately 500,000 childhood cancer survivors in the U.S. today. Childhood cancer survivors are vulnerable to late effects of therapy including chronic health conditions and premature death. Predicting survivor-specific risk of late effects, discussing how to manage these risks, and offering early preventions and interventions are critical components of survivorship care. Over 75% of childhood cancer survivors have prevalent symptoms, and constantly poor or worsening symptoms are associated with onset of medical late effects. However, regular symptom monitoring is uncommon in survivorship or primary care. The core concept of this R01 grant proposal is to enable regular monitoring of patient-generated health data (PGHD), including symptoms, physical activity, energy expenditure, sleep behavior and heart rate variability, and utilize these data in predicting survivor-specific risk of late effects to improve survivorship care and outcomes.  The proposed application will enroll 620 adult survivors of childhood cancer from the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study who are ≥5 years post diagnosis and currently ≥18 years of age at enrollment to achieve the following 3 specific aims: Aim 1) use a mobile health platform to collect dynamic PGHD data over 3 months and use them to develop and validate risk prediction models for future quality-of-life (QOL); Aim 2) develop/validate risk prediction models and establish personalized risk prediction scores for other outcomes (unplanned care utilization, physical performance deficits, onset of chronic health conditions) using the same approach as Aim 1; and Aim 3) create a web-based tool to calculate and report personalized outcome-specific risks, and facilitate integration of risk scores into the survivor’s patient portal and hospital’s Electronic Health Record (EHR).  We have a series of preliminary data to support this R01 grant proposal: a) in a pilot study assessing 20 common symptoms with a mobile health platform, childhood cancer survivors completed 90% of all required evaluations over 3 months; and b) in a prediction analysis from ongoing cohort of childhood cancer survivors, the inclusion of longitudinal symptom data generated a superior model performance in predicting future QOL (prediction measure, AUC=0.85) compared to the use of only age, sex, and childhood cancer type (AUC=0.63).  Linking through a mobile health platform, we will use a smartphone to collect symptom data, a wrist-worn accelerometer to collect momentary activity/behavioral data, and a finger sensor to collect heart rate variability data. We will predict patient-reported outcomes (poor QOL, unplanned healthcare utilization) and clinically- assessed outcomes (physical performance deficits, onset of chronic health conditions) on the 12th and 24th months after collecting risk factors. We will apply state-of-the-art machine/statistical learning techniques to capture features of dynamic changes in PGHD to predict these outcomes. We will build a Central Cancer Survivorship Platform to integrate predicted risks presented with interpretable scores into a patient portal and EHR, and to inform clinicians and survivors about potential adverse-event risks for risk management/intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE  We propose to develop survivor-specific risk models to predict adverse outcomes of childhood cancer through collecting daily symptoms and other patient-generated health data (physical activity, sleep behavior, heart rate variability) using mobile health devices. We will apply machine/statistical learning methods to develop and validate risk prediction models, and use qualitative methods to receive input from clinicians and survivors for developing a user-friendly dashboard and decision support tools. Our risk prediction tool will facilitate informing individualized levels of specific adverse outcomes, and providing key information for clinicians and survivors to discuss in view of preventive

"The Effects of Insurance Benefit Design Innovation on Patient Health Abstract My research in health economics has focused on how information and targeted consumer cost-sharing influences how patients choose providers and the financial savings of incentivizing patients to choose low-price providers. I have also examined the opposite side of the market, how patient use of information and targeted consumer incentives spurs provider price competition. These topics provided the framework for my research as a PhD student in Health Economics at the University of California, Berkeley and I continue to build on these topics while a policy researcher at the RAND Corporation. A natural next step for my career is to expand this line of research but in a more in-depth manner and using more advanced statistical methods. Performing mentored research in these areas will help me successfully make the transition from directed to independent research. The proposed study will help me to (1) contribute to a deeper understanding of patient health effects of an innovative insurance benefit design that is particularly relevant for the aging population; (2) continue to build capabilities working with large medical claims data sets and develop expertise in innovative statistical methods from different disciplines; (3) gain training in aging-related health-services research; (4) expand my exposure to the aging, health economics, and health services research communities; and (5) develop my abilities as an independent health services researcher and build the foundations to successfully compete for R01-level grants.  In this project, I propose to examine whether reference pricing for colonoscopies and pharmaceuticals decreases adherence to recommended colorectal cancer screening and medication therapies among the near- elderly population. I will also examine the impact of reference pricing on patient health outcomes and the aging process. To do so, I intend to apply novel machine-learning statistical methods that have been recently developed in the computer science and statistics fields. As part of this proposal, I have built a formal training plan to develop expertise in these methods. This project will provide me with the flexibility and support to develop a long-term research agenda that focuses on using innovative statistical methods to evaluate the comprehensive effects of consumer cost- sharing programs. Although this study focuses on a single cost- sharing program, reference pricing, the skills I gain through this award will allow me to independently lead evaluations of future benefit designs. The application of machine-learning methods to the setting of reference pricing will provide a framework that I or other researchers can use to evaluate other insurance benefit designs or alternative patient populations. ! Narrative An increasingly popular insurance benefit design, reference pricing, provides targeted financial incentives for consumers to receive care at low-cost providers. While the financial savings from reference pricing programs are well-known, the health impacts have yet to be studied. The proposed career grant will apply machine learning techniques to develop a long-term research agenda focused on understanding the patient health effects of reference pricing for colonoscopies and medication therapies, which are services that are especially relevant for the aging population. !",The Effects of Insurance Benefit Design Innovation on Patient Health,10188375,K01AG061274,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' California ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Deductibles ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' services research ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incentives ', ' Inpatients ', ' Insurance ', ' Insurance Benefits ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' Internal Medicine ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' New England ', ' Northeastern United States ', ' Patients ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Retirement ', ' Savings ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Cost Sharing ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' CRC screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' detect colo-rectal cancer ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Side ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' computer science ', ' Employee ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' response ', ' Provider ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' patient cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' treatment compliance ', ' compliance behavior ', ' Adherence ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' health economics ', ' asthmatic patient ', ' asthma patient ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' treatment effect ', ' aging population ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' patient population ', ' financial incentive ', ' financial reward ', ' monetary incentive ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' doctoral student ', ' Ph D student ', ' Ph D. student ', ' Ph.

"Semi-supervised Approaches to Denoising Electronic Health Records Data for Risk Prediction Project Summary While clinical trials remain a critical source for oncology research, their study findings may not be gener- alizable to the real world due to the restricted patient population. In recent years, due to the increasing adoption of electronic health records (EHR) and the linkage of EHR with specimen bio-repositories and other research registries, integrated large datasets now exist as a new source for translational research. These integrated datasets open opportunities for developing accurate EHR-based prediction models for disease progression and treatment response, which can be easily incorporated into clinical practice. These models can also be contrasted with models derived from clinical trials, bridging the gap between clinical trials and the real world. However, efficiently deriving and evaluating personalized prediction models using such real world data (RWD) remains challenging due to practical and methodological obstacles. For example, validated outcome information from EHR, such as development of colon cancer and 1-year treatment response, requires laborious medical record review and hence is often not readily available for research. Naive use of error prone surrogates of the outcome, such as billing codes or procedure codes, as the true outcome may greatly hamper the power of EHR studies and produce biased results. Semi-supervised risk prediction methods, leveraging noisy surrogates and a small amount of human annotations on the outcome, may greatly improve the utility of EHR for precision medicine research. Deriving a precise estimate of the risk model becomes even more challenging when the number of candidate features is not small relative to the number of annotated outcomes. Another major challenge with EHR risk modeling lies in the transportability. Complex machine learning models trained in one EHR system often attain low accuracy in another EHR system, due to the heterogeneity in the patient population and healthcare system. Transfer learning methods that can automatically adjust model developed for one EHR cohort to better fit to another EHR cohort is of great value. Synthesizing information from multiple data sources can improve the quality of evidence. However, meta analyzing EHR from multiple EHR cohorts faces an additional challenge due to patient privacy. We address these challenges by developing semi-supervised risk prediction methods with high dimensional predictions in Aim 1; semi-supervised transfer learning methods to enable risk prediction modeling in target populations with no gold standard labels uted learin Aim 2; and distributed learning methods for high dimensional predictive modeling in Aim. Project Narrative The research proposal addresses the pressing need for advanced statistical tools that meet challenges in current development of prediction models with high dimensional predictors using noisy data from electronic medical records augmented by a small amount of gold standard outcomes. By providing statistical tools that enable clinical investigators to effectively develop accurate and interpretable risk prediction models, this proposal will join prior and ongoing research

"Evaluation of artificial intelligence-controlled CPR to improve vital organ perfusion and survival during prolonged resuscitation Project Summary / Abstract  Almost 400,000 cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) occur each year in the United States. In patients requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for prolonged periods, current CPR methods are unable to maintain adequate blood flow and oxygen delivery to the vital organs. Survival is <10% in patients with shockable rhythms and ~0% in those with non-shockable rhythms. Current American Heart Association (AHA) recommendations for CPR follow a “one-size-fits-all” paradigm. Our goal is to improve vital organ perfusion during prolonged CPR by “personalizing” compression/decompression therapy with a dynamic CPR method that changes compression characteristics over the course of CPR after taking into account the temporal changes of chest wall compliance and hemodynamics in order to increase the rate of neurologically intact survival after OHCA.  In this grant proposal, we are investigating the deployment of machine learning algorithms incorporated into a mechanical CPR device to predict and optimize hemodynamics during CPR. We will use state-of-the-art dynamical modeling in conjunction with closed-loop control algorithms to individualize CPR characteristics and optimize temporal blood flow. Our preliminary results suggest that deployment of machine learning prediction algorithms paired with control algorithms in a preclinical Ventricular Fibrillation model can adapt compression and decompression depth in real time, resulting in increased vital organ blood flow as compared to standard CPR techniques Based on these results, we hypothesize that optimization of compression depth, decompression depth, duty cycle, and compression rate of CPR will lead to better outcomes. Our proposed research will: 1) identify the most promising algorithm for the prediction of CPR hemodynamics 2) identify the best control algorithm to pair with this prediction algorithm in terms of optimizing CPR hemodynamics and return of spontaneous circulation 3) use the prediction and control pairing to improve 48h neurologically intact survival in a porcine model of ventricular fibrillation, as compared to standard CPR techniques. Throughout this process, we will identify non-invasive alternative measurements to provide to the algorithms with the ultimate goal of proceeding with device development and human trials. Project Narrative In light of a growing body of evidence which suggests that prolonged duration CPR is a dynamic process, without universally optimal “one-size-fits-all” parameters, advanced methods of CPR individualization may be applied to optimize cardiac and cerebral perfusion for these patients. We propose to study the effects of machine learning and optimal control techniques within the context of CPR, thus creating a closed-loop CPR system that has been trained by pre-clinical data to modify CPR characteristics and optimize blood flow. Our preliminary studies suggest that machine learning and control algorithms can be successfully deployed in a preclinical model to adapt compression and decompression depth, increasing vital organ blood flow as compared to standard CPR techniques. If our hypotheses are verified, a gateway for the first human trials is open.",Evaluation of artificial intelligence-controlled CPR to improve vital organ perfusion and survival during prolonged resuscitation,10186125,R01HL157625,"['Algorithms ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biofeedback ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Circulation ', ' Carbon Dioxide ', ' CO2 ', ' Carbonic Anhydride ', ' Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation ', ' cardiac resuscitation ', ' heart resuscitation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' E-learning ', ' computer-assisted instruction ', ' computer-based education ', ' computer-based instruction ', ' computer-based learning ', ' computer-based training ', ' digital education ', ' digital learning ', ' eLearning ', ' electronic learning ', ' internet-assisted education ', ' internet-based training ', ' multimedia learning ', ' on-line education ', ' on-line learning ', ' online education ', ' online learning ', ' technology-enhanced learning ', ' virtual learning ', ' web-based instruction ', ' web-based training ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Early Mobilizations ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Methods ', ' Oxygen ', ' O element ', ' O2 element ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' pressure ', ' Publishing ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Resuscitation ', ' Shock ', ' Circulatory Collapse ', ' circulatory shock ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Family suidae ', ' Pigs ', ' Suidae ', ' Swine ', ' porcine ', ' suid ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Ventricular Fibrillation ', ' Ventricular Tachycardia ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Chest wall structure ', ' Chest Wall ', ' Thoracic Wall ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Animal Experiments ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Blood flow ', ' Cerebrum ', ' cerebral ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Measurement ', ' Collaborations ', ' Metabolic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' NIR Spectroscopy ', ' Near-Infrared Spectrometry ', ' Near-Infrared Spectroscopy ', ' Knowledge ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Devices ', ' Modeling ', ' time interval ', ' Early-Stage Clinical Trials ', ' Phase 1 Clinical Trials ', ' phase I protocol ', ' Phase I Clinical Trials ', ' Data ', ' device development ', ' instrument development ', ' Device or Instrument Development ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Preclinical Models ', ' Pre-Clinical Model ', ' in vivo ', ' Choices and Control ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' Outcome ', ' coronary perfusion ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' Gaussian model ', ' Gaussian statistics ', ' Gaussianity ', ' Gaussianity model ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' neural network ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' out-of-hospital cardiac arrest ', ' algorithm training ', ' porcine model ', ' pig model ', ' piglet model ', ' swine model ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2021,608552,MN-05
"Health Information Technology for Surveillance of Health Care-Associated Infections PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Health care-associated infections (HAIs) affect one in every 20 hospitalized patients and account for $10 billion dollars in potentially preventable health care expenditures annually. Current efforts at detection of HAIs are limited to manual chart review which hinders the generalizability and scalability of HAI detection. My goal in seeking a Mentored Clinical Scientist Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to develop a health services research career as a principal investigator focusing on leveraging novel health information technology (HIT) tools to improve the measurement of surgical health care quality, safety, and effectiveness. To continue my progress towards this goal, the objective of this project is to address the challenges of HAI detection by developing a robust and portable automated HAI surveillance toolkit. This toolkit will combine structured electronic health record (EHR) data with rich information locked in clinical notes using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to identify HAIs after surgical procedures. Our overall hypothesis is that combining structured variables from the EHR supplemented with NLP will improve our ability to identify HAIs after surgical procedures. To test the central hypothesis and accomplish the objectives for this application, I will pursue the following three specific aims: 1) Determine the EHR data elements indicative of postoperative HAIs and evaluate the performance of a novel HAI surveillance algorithm; 2) Identify the presence of postoperative SSIs from clinical notes using an automated portable NLP-based algorithm; 3) Apply user-centered design to create a high fidelity prototype of a surgical quality dashboard incorporating our HAI case detection methodology. This contribution is a significant first step in a continuum of research that utilizes the large amounts of data in the EHR combined with novel HIT methods to improve the measurement of surgical health-care quality, safety, and effectiveness. This approach is significant because the tools developed in this proposal have potential to serve as a prototype for identification and monitoring hospitals adverse events and could be replicated on a national scale. The proposed research is innovative in its approach using a combination of structured and unstructured data in the EHR along with novel machine learning and NLP tools to create a generalizable surveillance toolkit for the detection of HAIs. This proposal is responsive to the AHRQ Special Emphasis Notice (NOT-HS-13-011) specifically addressing the use of HIT to improve quality measurement. I have assembled a mentoring team who all internationally recognized experts with long and successful track records of funding and trainee mentorship. This project will provide the means to place me on a trajectory towards a health services research career focused on improving the measurement of surgical health-care quality, safety, and effectiveness using novel HIT tools. In summary, my previous training and experience, innovative research plan, high-quality training plan, first-rate mentorship team, and supportive research environment give me the highest likelihood of success to research independence with the proposed K08 award. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The proposed research and career development plan are relevant to public health because health care- associated infections (HAIs) affect about one in every 20 hospitalized patients and account for $30 billion dollars in potentially preventable health care expenditures annually. The objective of this project is to develop robust and portable automated surveillance toolkit that combines structured EHR data with rich information locked in clinical notes using natural language processing to identify HAIs after surgical procedures.

"Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance Project Summary Post-surgical complications (PSCs) have been an increasing concern for hospitals, particularly in light of payment reform focusing on longer episodes and Medicare penalties for 30-day readmissions and adverse outcomes including deep or organ space surgical site infections (DOS-SSIs). Readmission due to post- discharge complications in particular has become a target for quality improvement since many of these events are considered preventable. The wide adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has led to a number of clinical risk models for PSCs. These modeling efforts have primarily been targeted at the surgical specialty areas within which a large number of events occur (such as colorectal surgery) as well as applying sophisticated statistical modeling / machine learning to allow for missing data, interactions, and nonlinearities. However, there is still considerable room for improvement both in terms of accuracy and generalizability. In our current funding period, we have demonstrated the predictive value of clinical notes for PSCs. However, one glaring limitation of current models is that they are trained on high volume surgical specialties at large tertiary care institutions with high quality clinical data and use of advanced informatics approaches. The impetus of this proposal is essentially two-fold: (i) Accurate models can be created for lower volume institutions and specialties via transfer learning and leveraging more data via unconfirmed outcomes (i.e., those that mimic gold standard outcomes, but are less reliable) with proper accounting of reliability. (ii) Decision making can be significantly improved by leveraging time varying, real-time data such as labs, vitals, and clinical notes to provide the current risk of PSCs for patients using all information as it becomes available. We aim to i) develop and apply longitudinal risk models for PSCs to explicitly account for the time varying nature of some of the information (e.g., labs, vitals, clinical notes) as it becomes available in real-time so that it can be integrated into the clinician’s decision making; ii) develop and apply transfer learning to PSC risk models; iii) develop modeling approaches that allow for the use of more widely available unconfirmed outcomes, while explicitly accounting for the additional uncertainty and bias due to the use of such unconfirmed outcomes when compared to a less available gold standard; and iv) develop a widely applicable framework for model evaluation and monitoring. Models will often not perform in practice as they do in research for a variety of reasons. This framework will allow us to identify these issues and more efficiently translate and apply these complex predictive models into practice so that the research can have an immediate clinical impact. Successful development would open the door for next generation patient monitoring, alerts, and interventions for all surgical specialties and all institutions. We will make the relevant modeling results publicly available so that lower volume institutions can leverage the transfer learning approach developed here without the need for our actual data. This will ultimately lead to improved patient care and lower overall cost by identifying complications early and limiting readmission due to PSCs at Mayo Clinic and other institutions across the nation. Narrative Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EHRs) has led to unprecedented opportunities to use EHRs for clinical practice and research. We explore the use of EHRs for near real-time postsurgical complication surveillance with the aim of improving health care quality and reducing health care cost through enhanced analytics towards surgical excellence.",Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance,10202598,R01EB019403,"['Accounting ', ' Adoption ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Breast ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Colorectal Surgery ', ' Colon and Rectal Surgery ', ' colon and rectum surgery ', ' Complication ', ' Decision Making ', ' Feedback ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Gold ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Hospitals ', ' indexing ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Pancreas ', ' Pancreatic ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Surgical Specialties ', ' Surgical Profession ', ' surgery specialty ', ' Surgical Wound Infection ', ' surgical site infection ', ' Time ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' Translating ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Surgical complication ', ' surgery complication ', ' data quality ', ' Funding ', ' Glare ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Informatics ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' novel ', ' payment ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Institution ', ' Data ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' microbiome ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' rapid growth ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' tertiary care ', ' clinical practice ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' clinical risk ', ' genetic information ', ' Data Science ', ' high dimensionality ', ' clinical implementation ', ' risk prediction model ', ' unstructured data ', ' ']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2021,630812,MN-01
"Autonomous diagnosis and management of the critically ill during air transport (ADMIT) Project Summary/Abstract: Cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) is common in trauma patients and other acutely ill patients being transferred from trauma sites or between hospital centers. Although paramedics/nurses (PM/RN) have some success in rescuing unstable patients with CRI using defined protocols and decrease incidence of inter-transport severe circulatory shock, the shock recognition tools available and resuscitation endpoints are limited to blood pressure and heart rate thresholds. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established when patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. If one could accurately predict who, when and why these critically ill patients develop CRI, then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve care and triage resulting in better use of healthcare resources. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable STAT MedEvac air transported patients. We will validate these approaches in our existing >5,000 patient STAT MedEvac database, containing highly granular continuous non-invasive monitoring waveforms of air transported critically ill patients linked to their primary care and inpatient electronic health records (EHR). This level of patient information and granularity linked to treatment data and patient outcomes is unprecedented. We will extend our analysis to include more complex CRI, richer data, deeper analytics, and larger libraries of critically ill patients while in air transport, linking our proven Functional Hemodynamic Monitoring (FHM) principles for pathophysiologic diagnosis and resuscitation with non-invasive monitoring to operationalize personalized resuscitation. We will concurrently running two specific aims. First, we will develop through the Carnegie Melon University Auton Lab multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques to predict CRI. We will do this initially on our existing porcine hemorrhagic shock model data (n=60) and then on our STAT MedEvac dataset linked to EHR (n >5,000 patients), determining the minimal data (measures, sampling frequency, observation duration) required to robustly identify deviation from health, likely CRI cause, and response to treatment (endpoint of resuscitation), as well as the incremental benefit of additional variables, analysis, lead-time and sampling frequency to predict CRI and response to treatment, and examine the trade-offs between model parsimony and specificity. Second, we will evaluate our existing clinical decision support (CDS) tools to interface with FHM principles and ML- defined interactions, and trial this in silico first on our porcine hemorrhagic shock resuscitation, then on our STAT MedEvac data, followed by prospective human simulation on flight crew PM/RN (n=160) during annual training for agreement and benefit, defining effectiveness based on diagnosis accuracy, time to diagnosis, intervention choice accuracy and time to intervention. This iterative process will modify the existing CDS platform into one more specifically suited for air transport scenarios. Finally, we will evaluate the resultant semi-autonomous management protocol initially in retrospect in 100 STAT MedEvac patients and 10 Emergency Department trauma patients and then prospectively by active CDS in a final 100 STAT MedEvac patients. We will prospectively analyze the effectiveness of these calibrated CDS tools for predictive ability of the various ML models and apply the best, most practical and parsimonious predictive models for clinical care during transport based on patient population, pathological processes and support staff. Project narrative We propose to develop and trial of proactive approach to diagnosis and management of vulnerable critically ill patients during STAT MedEvac air transport from trauma sites and inter-hospital transfer. We will use machine learning approaches to plumb our existing rich >5500 patient STAT MedEvac waveform data linked to their electronic health records to define level of severity, predict impending cardiovascular instability and to both drive in-flight resuscitation and alert receiving Emergency Department triage. We will use our existing clinically relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to focus initial human instability algorithms and then refine our existing graph user interface clinical decisions support (CDS) algorithm, first in animal and with paramedic/nurse dyads in human simulation and then during actual STAT MedEvac air transport and Emergency Department care of trauma patients creating a scalable CDS platform to support paramedic/nurse smart monitoring and proactive resuscitation of these high risk patients.",Autonomous diagnosis and management of the critically ill during air transport (ADMIT),10141287,R01HL141916,"['Air ', ' Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Health ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Inpatients ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Libraries ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Paramedical Personnel ', ' Paramedic ', ' Pathologic Processes ', ' Pathological Processes ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Records ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resuscitation ', ' Running ', ' Shock ', ' Circulatory Collapse ', ' circulatory shock ', ' Hemorrhagic Shock ', ' Specificity ', ' Standardization ', ' Family suidae ', ' Pigs ', ' Suidae ', ' Swine ', ' porcine ', ' suid ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Traumatic Hemorrhage ', ' Triage ', ' Universities ', ' Weaning ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Normal Range ', ' Normal Values ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Mechanical ventilation ', ' mechanical respiratory assist ', ' mechanically ventilated ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Refractory ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Melons ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Hypovolemia ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' success ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' simulation ', ' Agreement ', ' Graph ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Organ failure ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Serious Adverse Event ', ' Severe Adverse Event ', ' serious adverse experience ', ' serious adverse reaction ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Emergency Care ', ' ED care ', ' ER care ', ' Emergency Department care ', ' Emergency Room care ', ' Emergency health care ', ' Emergency healthcare ', ' Emergency medical care ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' cost ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Sepsis ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' prospective ', ' Trauma ', ' Coupled ', ' advanced system ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' iterative design ', ' demographics ', ' non-invasive monitor ', ' noninvasive monitor ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' signal processing ', ' Emergency Department Physician ', ' ED Physician ', ' ER physician ', ' Emergency Physician ', ' Emergency room physician ', ' Trauma patient ', ' support tools ', ' predictive tools ', ' clinical decision support ', ' in silico ', ' data streams ', ' organ injury ', ' injury to organs ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' porcine model ', ' pig model ', ' piglet model ', ' swine model ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,652539,PA-18
"Adapt2Quit – A Machine-Learning, Adaptive Motivational System: RCT for Socio-Economically Disadvantaged smokers” 7. Project Summary We will test Adapt2Quit, an innovative Machine-Learning, Adaptive Motivational Messaging System. Adapt2Quit uses complex, machine-learning algorithms to adaptively select the best messages for a smoker, based upon multiple attributes, including: 1) the smoker’s profile; 2) the smoker’s explicit feedback over time to the system; and 3) data from thousands of prior smokers’ profiles and their feedback patterns. Adapt2Quit’s type of machine- learning is called a recommender system. Outside healthcare, companies (like Amazon) use recommender systems to continuously learn from user feedback (e.g.: liked product, products purchased) to improve, thus enhancing personal relevance and customer engagement. Engagement is a huge challenge for digital health. In the field of computer-tailored health messaging, Adapt2Quit is the first to use machine-learning to continuously adapt to feedback and select new personalized messages to send to smokers. To evaluate the impact of the recommender system, Adapt2Quit will be compared with a robust, active control, a simple but effective messaging system. In our pilot experiment, Adapt2Quit outperformed the control, especially among socio- economically disadvantaged (SED) smokers. SED smokers are harder to engage in interventions. Thus, Adapt2Quit’s increased engagement will be of particular importance for targeting SED smokers. In addition to the potential impact of the Adapt2Quit messages in inducing and engaging smokers in cessation, our goal is to increase use of the state Quitline. We will recruit 700 SED smokers at two sites. All smokers will complete a baseline interview and receive a paper brochure with information about the state’s Quitline. Smokers will then be randomized to: Adapt2Quit or the standard messaging. As the system is designed to enhance engagement, and through engagement lead to positive actions, Aim 1 will focus on engagement [Hypothesis (H1a) Among Adapt2Quit smokers, those with higher engagement levels (completed more ratings) will have greater scores on the perceived competence scale (PCS)]. Aim 2 compares (Adapt2Quit and control) behavior change processes including perceived competence for smoking cessation and cessation supporting actions (calling a Quitline) [H2a: Adapt2Quit smokers will have greater scores on the PCS than control smokers; H2b: Adapt2Quit smokers will adopt more cessation supporting actions (Quitline, NRT) than control smokers]. Aim 3 will assess effectiveness of the system [H3a: (primary outcome) Adapt2Quit smokers will have greater smoking cessation rates (6-month point prevalence biochemically verified) than control smokers; H3b: (secondary outcome) Adapt2Quit smokers will have lower time to first quit attempt than control smokers; H3c: (mediation analysis) Measured internal and external processes will mediate the effect of Adapt2Quit on smoking cessation]. To accomplish the above aims, we have brought together a multidisciplinary team with relevant expertise, and a strong track record of collaboration. 8. Narrative We propose testing Adapt2Quit — an innovative motivational texting “recommender system.” Adapt2Quit enhances tailored motivational messaging systems using machine-learning algorithms to learn from, and adapt to, user feedback (prior and daily message ratings), thereby increasing message personal relevance.

Its established weaknesses include: 1) the obstetrician’s highly subjective visual interpretations of the signal patterns and 2) the widespread use of unproven surrogates for relevant fetal hypoxic and/or ischemic injury such as umbilical arterial pH, intrapartum stillbirth, newborn Apgar scores and neonatal seizures. This technology over the past 50 years has not been shown to decrease stillbirths or reduce the numbers of infants with cerebral palsy. EFM as it is presently used in the clinical setting has been associated with an extraordinary increase in the use of operative vaginal delivery and cesarean delivery. No functional algorithm has yet been developed that integrates clinical data collected in the antepartum period and during labor and any other patient specific data with the results of EFM. The main objective of the proposed research is to use recent breakthroughs in machine learning to drive the development of predictive analytics to support and improve the interpretation of EFM data, especially under real world conditions and in real time where clinicians must make timely decisions about interventions to prevent adverse outcomes. It is anticipated that the proposed research will result in significantly decreased use of operative vaginal delivery and cesarean delivery while more precisely defining the fetus at risk for developing metabolic acidosis and long term neurologic injury. The essential role of electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) of the fetal heart rate (FHR) during labor is to prevent adverse outcomes due to oxygen deficiency, but its weaknesses almost all stem from the obstetrician’s highly subjective visual interpretations of the signal patterns. The widespread use of this technology over the past 50 years has not been shown to decrease stillbirths or reduce the numbers of infants with severe hypoxic/ischemic neurological disorders, but it has been associated with an extraordinary increase in cesarean delivery rates. The main objective of the proposed research is to use recent breakthroughs in machine learning to drive the development of predictive analytics to support and improve the interpretation of FHR monitoring data, especially under real world conditions where clinicians must make timely decisions about interventions to prevent adverse outcomes.

"Streamlining Volumetric Imaging, Analysis and Publication Using Immersive Virtual Reality Over the past 15 years, new imaging technologies and methods for high throughput imaging have revolutionized structural biology by extending the resolution and scale of collected images in 3 dimensions. The resulting image volumes are more typically hundreds of GB to even tens of TB and in some cases approach PB sizes. These file sizes pose challenges for image acquisition, image analysis, and communication of a representative set of raw data and quantification. Image acquisition runs can be lengthy and expensive, and often errors are not identified until after the completion of scanning. Large files contain many structures, and require machine learning (ML) strategies in a context that permits error correction. Scientific communication requires tools for ready access to raw data, and more efficient methods to communicate the rapidly accumulating sets of scientific information. We propose to leverage virtual reality (VR) and verbal communication within the VR environment, to streamline each of these stages of scientific work, by capitalizing on the more natural abilities for stereoscopic vision and hearing to process scenes and language. Based upon the tool base and direct volume rendering of large files that we have established in our VR software, called syGlass, we will first integrate VR into the microscope controls for tuning the microscope and then efficiently inspecting images in 3D as they are acquired (Aim 1). Next, we will introduce novel domain adaptation techniques in the ML field to scale up 3D image quantification capabilities for current acquisition sizes, by coupling them with user-optimized experiences that do not require ML expertise, and yet provide automated and accurate results (Aim 2). Finally, we will provide tools to efficiently generate narrated scientific presentations in VR for use in the lab setting, as manuscript publications, and for production of educational materials (Aim 3). In each of these activities, we will introduce paradigm shifts in the management of experiments, analysis of the resulting data, and publication of manuscripts and materials to other scientists and the general public. The goal of this project is to speed the pipeline from image acquisition to communication of analyzed data for large image files (big data). We propose to leverage virtual reality to change the way users interact with their microscope, provide new methods for more accurate quantification and make scientific data more transparent, and more accessible to specialists and the general public. These new paradigms are applicable to basic, pre-clinical and clinical research, and serve the goals of big data projects to generate more reliable and encompassing scientific conclusions.","Streamlining Volumetric Imaging, Analysis and Publication Using Immersive Virtual Reality",10143312,R44MH125238,"['Awareness ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Depth Perception ', ' Stereopsis ', ' Stereoscopic Vision ', ' visual depth perception ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Hearing ', ' Information Distribution ', ' Investments ', ' Language ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Lighting ', ' Illumination ', ' Manuals ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Microscopy ', ' Modernization ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Production ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Resort ', ' Running ', ' Science ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Specialist ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' Microscope ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Training ', ' Ingestion ', ' Visual ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scientist ', ' Hour ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' structural biology ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' movie ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' virtual reality ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' 3-D Imaging ', ' 3D imaging ', ' Three-Dimensional Imaging ', ' 3-D Images ', ' 3-D image ', ' 3D image ', ' 3D images ', ' Three-Dimensional Image ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Device ', ' Resolution ', ' Collection ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Instruction ', ' scale up ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Coupling ', ' pre-clinical research ', ' preclinical research ', ' optogenetics ', ' 4D Imaging ', ' 4-D imaging ', ' four-dimensional imaging ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' feature detection ', ' feature recognition ', ' virtual reality environment ', ' immersive digital environment ', ' immersive environment ', ' immersive virtual environment ', ' immersive virtual reality ', ' Visualization ', ' 3D virtual reality ', ' 3-D virtual reality ', ' 3-dimensional virtual reality ', ' three-dimensional virtual reality ', ' data dissemination ', ' adaptation algorithm ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' data exploration ', ' ']",NIMH,ISTOVISR,R44,2021,499966,WV-01
"Statistical Methods for Incorporating Machine Learning Tools in Inference and Large-Scale Surveillance using Electronic Medical Records Data SUMMARY The modernization and standardization of clinical care information systems is creating large networks of linked electronic health records (EHR) that capture key treatments and select patient outcomes for millions of patients throughout the country. The observational data emerging from these systems provide an unparalleled opportunity to learn about the effectiveness of existing and novel treatments, and to monitor potential safety issues that may arise when interventions are used in broad patient populations. However, observational clinical data have exposures that are driven by many factors and therefore aggressive adjustment is needed to remove as much confounding bias as possible in order to make attribution regarding select exposures. The field of machine learning provides a powerful collection of data-driven approaches for performing flexible, thorough confounding adjustment, but performing reliable statistical inference is particularly challenging when these techniques are used as part of the analytic strategy. We propose to advance reproducible research methods by developing and illustrating novel targeted learning tools that leverage the flexibility of machine learning methods to detect and characterize health effect signals using large-scale EHR data. Specifically, we will first develop techniques for making efficient, statistically valid and robust inference for treatment effects using state-of-the-art machine learning tools. We will also develop online learning techniques to make such inference in the context of streaming EHR data. Methodological advances will enable us to formulate a formal, rigorous and practical framework for conducting continuous, effective and reliable surveillance for safety endpoints. Finally, we will develop statistical approaches for incorporating prior information -- including demographic, epidemiologic or pharmacodynamic knowledge, for example -- to improve health effect estimation and inference when the health outcome of interest is rare and the statistical problem is thus difficult, as often occurs in safety surveillance. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to enable biomedical researchers and public health regulators to carefully monitor and protect the health of the public by allowing them to more effectively and more reliably detect critical health effect signals that may be contained in population-scale EHR data. PROJECT NARRATIVE The modernization and standardization of clinical care information systems is creating large networks of linked electronic medical records that capture key treatments and select patient outcomes for millions of U.S. subjects. The population scale of contemporary health care data is opening new opportunities for quickly learning from observational data, and is now supporting on-going national surveillance that will monitor the risks and benefits of both existing and novel treatment paths. The objective of this proposal is to provide an inferential framework that leverages the flexibility of machine learning methods to detect health effect signals, including in the important setting of high-dimensional confounders and/or rare events, and to develop a real-time sequential updating methodology for safety signal detection.",Statistical Methods for Incorporating Machine Learning Tools in Inference and Large-Scale Surveillance using Electronic Medical Records Data,10206237,R01HL137808,"['Algorithms ', ' E-learning ', ' computer-assisted instruction ', ' computer-based education ', ' computer-based instruction ', ' computer-based learning ', ' computer-based training ', ' digital education ', ' digital learning ', ' eLearning ', ' electronic learning ', ' internet-assisted education ', ' internet-based training ', ' multimedia learning ', ' on-line education ', ' on-line learning ', ' online education ', ' online learning ', ' technology-enhanced learning ', ' virtual learning ', ' web-based instruction ', ' web-based training ', ' Confidence Intervals ', ' Data Collection ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Structural Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Patients ', ' Population Surveillance ', ' Public Health Surveillance ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Safety ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Estimation Techniques ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Stream ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' novel ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Pharmacodynamics ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Sentinel ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Subgroup ', ' Surveillance Program ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' national surveillance ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' treatment effect ', ' user-friendly ', ' open source ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' risk minimization ', ' surveillance data ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' comparative treatment ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' high dimensionality ', ' Infrastructure ', ' data streams ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,486155,WA-07
"Stanford Advanced Wound Care Center Clinical Research Unit SUMMARY   Approximately  25%  of  diabetic  patients  experience  diabetic  foot  ulcers  (DFUs).  This  is  a  significant  clinical  problem since there are no effective biomarkers for predicting outcomes, no drug candidates that have recently  been  FDA-­approved  and  no  therapies  that  are  widely  effective  in  treatment.  The  Stanford  Advanced  Wound  Care  Center  (AWCC)  was  opened  in  2014  with  the  sole  purpose  of  facilitating  clinical  trials,  conducting  translational  research  and  providing  care  for  patients  with  chronic  wounds.  Stanford  AWCC  receives  patients  from the University Healthcare Alliance, which spans 60 clinics and 2.5 million people in the San Francisco Bay  Area.  Despite  being  in  a  relatively  prosperous  area,  Stanford  AWCC  treats  patients  from  diverse  socio-­ demographics. In the past two years, Stanford has treated 6000 patients with wounds, of whom 705 had DFUs.  50%  of  the  patients  enroll  in  clinical  trials  and  there  is  a  very  low  dropout  rate  (less  than  5%).  Under  Dr.  Geoffrey  Gurtner’s  leadership,  the  Stanford  AWCC  has  conducted  over  25  clinical  trials,  where  we  have  measured biomarkers and tested novel therapeutic interventions (Aim 1).     It is known that wound healing trials experience a significantly higher failure rate in Phase III studies compared  to  any  other  drug  trial.  This  is  primarily  due  to  the  poorly  controlled  procedural  component  of  wound  care.  At  Stanford,  we  address  these  issues  by  (i)  practicing  a  multi-­disciplinary  approach  overseen  by  physicians,  (ii)  standardizing  the  measuring  and  reporting  of  healing  outcomes,  (iii)  emphasizing  rigorous  and  efficient  operational  processes  during  clinical  trial  conduct  and  (iv)  collaborating  with  other  major  academic  centers  (Aim  2).  Looking  forward,  it  is  critical  to  optimize  patient  engagement  during  their  treatment  regimens  and  inculcate  a  shared  decision-­making  process.  Clinical  studies  in  medical  fields  such  as  cancer  have  indicated  that  such  patient-­centered  approaches  lead  to  the  adherence  of  treatment  regimens  and  clinical  trials.  This  is  currently  lacking  in  with  patients  with  DFUs.  With  Dr.  Arden  Morris’s  expertise,  the  Stanford  AWCC  practices  new approaches that centers around the patient, with a focus on improvement in their quality of life (Aim 3).     Dr.  Nigam  Shah,  the  Director  of  Bioinformatics  at  Spectrum,  Stanford’s  Clinical  and  Translational  Sciences  Award  has  worked  with  the  Stanford  AWCC  and  developed  computational  tools  that  predict  wound  healing  outcomes. These models have been developed using data from the Healogics database, the country’s largest  network  of  wound  care  clinics  and  a  Stanford  AWCC  operational  partner.  Dr.  Shah  also  has  expertise  in  analyzing electronic health records of patients from large databases such as TRUVEN and OPTUM, which will  allow  for  the  determination  of  unique  biomarkers  for  wound  healing  through  computational  modeling.  These  models can be executed across the entire Diabetic Foot Consortium (Aim 4).    Narrative    The  Stanford  Advanced  Wound  Care  Center  (AWCC)  was  opened  in  October  2014  to  fill  both  a  clinical  and  academic  need  by  integrating  clinical  trials  and  research  in  wound  care.  Since  its  launch,  the  number  of  patients  with  DFUs  at  Stanford  AWCC  has  doubled  in  each  of  the  past  two  years  and  the  unit  has  been  financially  successful,  ensuring  its  long-­term  viability.  Here,  we  demonstrate  the  ability  of  Stanford  AWCC  to  serve  as  a  Clinical  Research  Unit  (CRU)  by  displaying  access  to  patients  with  DFUs  from  a  wide  sociodemographic, emphasizing quality of clinical research conducted, demonstrating ways of patient-­centered  collaborative decision making and using big data to accurately predict and quantify wound healing outcomes.           ",Stanford Advanced Wound Care Center Clinical Research

"Automated Seizure Detection for Home Seizure Monitoring with Epilog Sensors ABSTRACT Aura is a digital health platform that uses Epilog™, a miniature, wireless, wearable EEG sensor worn on the scalp below hairline that can record clinical and subclinical seizures. After an initial diagnosis of epilepsy, an epileptologist will use known information about patients’ seizures to guide the best scalp location to place the Epilog EEG sensor (A). EEG data is continuously transferred (B) to the Aura app on a person’s smartphone (C) using secure BluetoothTM where it communicates over WiFi (D) to the Aura cloud platform (E). Epilog EEG is analyzed for seizures and a daily digital seizure diary is shared with epileptologists (F) and pushed back to the Aura app (G). Epilog is recharged daily, and reusable for a year. Epilog is designed to be discreet, allowing for continuous use in all facets of daily life. Data are a 10 s snippet of the beginning of a focal seizure with motor impairment and intact awareness (ILAE 1A1) recorded from Epitel’s single-channel Epilog sensor placed on the left forehead. The patient was admitted for video-EEG monitoring as standard-of-care. This seizure was verified independently by three epileptologists. In Phase I, automated, machine learning-based seizure detection algorithms will be designed to first work in the Aura cloud to detect seizures in Epilog EEG, including seizures a person may not consciously know they are having (>50% of all seizures), such as while sleeping. Aura will run these algorithms developed exclusively for Epilog’s single-channel of EEG to provide a daily digital seizure diary. In Phase II, the Aura system will enter clinical validation trials for FDA clearance as an EEG-based automated home seizure detection and alerting system. Early in Phase II Aura will be commercialized as a medical device-enabled-service business model. Out-of-pocket costs for a person living with epilepsy is an average of $380/year. Armed with long-term, reproducible EEG, epileptologists will now have a more precise, quantitative record of seizure counts, enabling them to adapt patient treatment more rapidly and successfully to improve quality of life. Aura will give people living with epilepsy their lives back. Aura provides certainty where you are and when you need it. Throughout Phase II, physiological, psychological, behavioral, and environmental factors will be combined in the Aura app to collect 27,000 days of multi-modal data from 300 patients to create an unprecedented dataset of features known to precipitate seizures. These data will be used in Phase III to create a robust, wearable seizure forecasting system using artificial intelligence that combines multi-modal seizure precipitating factors, creating an hourly seizure probability. Aura will profoundly disrupt how epilepsy is managed and improve the quality of life of people living with epilepsy.

"A Machine Learning Alternative to Beamforming to Improve Ultrasound Image Quality for Interventional Access to the Kidney Project Summary  Despite the widespread prevalence of ultrasound imaging in hospitals today, the clinical utility of ultrasound guidance is severely hampered by clutter and reverberation artifacts that obscure structures of interest and com- plicate anatomical measurements. Clutter is particularly problematic in overweight and obese individuals, who account for 78.6 million adults and 12.8 million children in North America. Similarly, interventional procedures of- ten require insertion of one or more metal tools, which generate reverberation artifacts that obfuscate instrument location, orientation, and geometry, while obscuring nearby tissues, thus additionally hampering ultrasound im- age quality. Although artifacts are problematic, ultrasound continues to persist primarily because of its greatest strengths (i.e., mobility, cost, non-ionizing radiation, real-time visualization, and multiplanar views) in comparison to existing image-guidance options, but it would be signiﬁcantly more useful without problematic artifacts.  Our long-term project goal is to use state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to provide interventional radiologists with artifact-free ultrasound-based images. We will initially develop a new framework alternative to the ultrasound beamforming process that removes needle tip reverberations and acoustic clutter caused by multipath scattering in near-ﬁeld tissues when guiding needles to the kidney to enable removal of painful kidney stones. Our ﬁrst aim will test convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that input raw channel data and output human readable images with no artifacts caused by multipath scattering and reverberations. A secondary goal of the CNNs is to learn the minimum number of parameters required to create these new CNN-based images. Our second aim will validate the trained algorithms with ultrasound data from experimental phantom and ex vivo tissue. Our third aim will extend our evaluation to ultrasound images of in vivo porcine kidneys. This work is the ﬁrst to propose bypassing the entire beamforming process and replacing it with machine learning and computer vision techniques to remove traditionally problematic noise artifacts and create a fundamentally new type of artifact-free, high-contrast, high-resolution, ultrasound-based image for guiding interventional procedures.  This work combines the expertise of an imaging scientist, a computer scientist, and an interventional ra- diologist to explore an untapped, understudied area that is only recently made feasible through improvements in computing power, advances in computer vision capabilities, and new knowledge about dominant sources of image degradation. Translation to in vivo cases is enabled by our clinical collaboration with the Department of Radiology at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. With support from the NIH Trailblazer Award, our team will be the ﬁrst to develop these tools and capabilities to eliminate noise artifacts in interventional ultrasound, opening the door to a new paradigm in ultrasound image formation, which will directly beneﬁt millions of patients with clearer, easier-to-interpret ultrasound images. Subsequent R01 funding will customize our innovation to addi- tional application-speciﬁc ultrasound procedures (e.g., breast biopsies, cancer detection, autonomous surgery). Project Narrative Artifacts in ultrasound images, speciﬁcally artifacts caused by multipath scattering and acoustic reverberations (which occur when imaging through the abdominal tissue of overweight and obese patients or visualizing metallic surgical tools), remain as a major clinical challenge. There are no existing solutions to eliminate these artifacts based on today's signal processing techniques. The goal of this project is to step away from conventional signal processing models and instead learn from raw data examples with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques that differentiate artifacts from true signals, and thereby deliver clearer, easier-to-interpret images.",A Machine Learning Alternative to Beamforming to Improve Ultrasound Image Quality for Interventional Access to the Kidney,10170765,R21EB025621,"['Abdomen ', ' Abdominal ', ' Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Award ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Computers ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Calculi ', ' Kidney Stones ', ' Renal Calculi ', ' Renal Stone ', ' Learning ', ' Metals ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Needles ', ' Noise ', ' North America ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Nonionizing Radiation ', ' Non-Ionizing Electromagnetic Radiation ', ' Non-Ionizing Radiation ', ' Nonionizing Electromagnetic Radiation ', ' Radiation-Non-Ionizing Total ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Family suidae ', ' Pigs ', ' Suidae ', ' Swine ', ' porcine ', ' suid ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translations ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' Work ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Interventional Ultrasonography ', ' Interventional Ultrasound ', ' Evaluation ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' radiologist ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' Structure ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Bypass ', ' Modeling ', ' Readability ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' image guided intervention ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Network-based ', ' Geometry ', ' signal processing ', ' image guided ', ' image guidance ', ' Breast biopsy ', ' metallicity ', ' imaging scientist ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' Visualization ', ' algorithm training ', ' obese person ', ' obese individuals ', ' obese people ', ' obese population ', ' obese subjects ', ' obese patients ', ' patients with obesity ', ' ']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,235027,MD-07
"Polygenic Risk Scores for Healthier African American Families PROJECT ABSTRACT  To advance the health and care of children, as in eMERGE II & III, CCHMC will assemble a birth cohort in eMERGE IV, ascertained on pregnant or recently delivered self-identified African-American (AA) women and their babies, along with the willing fathers and siblings. The eMERGE IV collection will be the inaugural effort in a new CCHMC initiative, a birth cohort of mother and baby dyads called My Genome and Me, Cincinnati (MGMC), conceived to develop an understanding of the genomics that informs health and disease risk, beginning at birth and continuing across the lifespan with dyads randomized at enrollment to genotyping with return of results as neonates or later as older children. Our eMERGE IV project will directly grapple with the ethical issues raised by return of results to families with different considerations operating in babies, siblings and parents regarding the particular phenotypes being studied. For eMERGE IV, as site-specific phenotypes, we nominate Asthma, Atopic Dermatitis, Obesity, Hypercholesterolemia, Hypertension, Prematurity, and Breast Cancer. We will exploit the work done that will enable developing polygenic risk scores (PRSs) and genomic risk estimates (GREs) for these conditions in addition to the 15 others chosen by the eMERGE IV Network and anticipate developing consensus across the Network for the PRSs and GREs applied. The care of families will exploit the harmonization of the electronic health records between the adult and pediatric hospitals, which has been achieved with the Maternal and Infant Data Hub (MIDH) using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model. For data quality control we will evaluate discrepancies between eMERGE IV genotyping and low read depth coverage (LRDC) genotypes (LRDC sequencing will be at CCHMC expense.) We will collect preferences and attitudes of our local AA community with respect to genomic results and return of results. We will develop health risk-reducing recommendations and return GREs with and without actionable PRSs to assess the influence of PRSs on the adherence to risk-mitigating recommendations. We will use SMART on FHIR (Substitutable Medical Applications, Reusable Technologies and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource) through the electronic health record (EHR)-integrated clinical decision support (CDS)-Hooks framework to provide CDS to both the adult and pediatric EHR systems. We will periodically revise PRSs and GREs and return changes when indicated. CCHMC will provide LRDC sequencing from >17,000 DNA AA samples from children in the CCHMC biobank and ≥50,000 subjects in total for genotype generation and mitochondrial DNA variant analysis. Federated geocoding will be available to all eMERGE IV sites from CCHMC. To disseminate genomic practice within CCHMC, across the Network, and in general, CCHMC will provide services to advance PRSs and GREs for specific conditions, starting with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, migraine headache, and suicide. In sum, CCHMC presents an aggressive program use genomic medicine to advance toward better health outcomes focused on underserved AA dyads of neonates and mothers with their families. Project Narrative Cincinnati Children's (CCHMC) proposes to join eMERGE IV by enrolling of local Cincinnati African-American newborn babies and their mothers with available fathers and brothers and sisters to develop predictions of their risk for Asthma, Atopic Dermatitis, Obesity, Hypercholesterolemia, Hypertension, Prematurity, and Breast Cancer (along with 15 disorders chosen by the eMERGE IV Network and disorders chosen by CCHMC Faculty) using genetic variation, environmental factors, and family history. We will test whether knowledge of having a higher genetic risk for these disorders will motivate closer adherence to health recommendations made to reduce disease risk.",Polygenic Risk Scores for

"ICLIC-MS for Enhancing Outcomes Research and Clinical Care in Multiple Sclerosis PROJECT SUMMARY Cognitive impairment, physical disability and progressive disease are common but understudied clinical outcomes that substantially impact employment and overall quality of life for individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS). We have recently developed and validated an assisted, web-based tool (ICLIC-MS) for systematic and longitudinal clinical outcomes data collection of MS-validated cognitive function measures, physical disability and progressive disease measures that are not reliably captured in the electronic health record (EHR). In response to FOA# PA-17-010, Use of Technology to Enhance Patient Outcomes and Prevent Illness, our team proposes the study of MS outcomes in a large, multi-ethnic population representative sample of more than 3,000 female and male MS cases from the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Health Plan Membership. We will integrate other EHR data such as important comorbid conditions, use of disease modifying therapy, MRI reports, as well as quality of life measures and employment histories. Our goals include: 1) comprehensively characterizing clinical outcomes in a large MS patient cohort; 2) developing and utilizing an integrated MS health report to enhance patient care; and 3) establishing a resource for clinical outcomes research in MS that also includes whole genomic and environmental exposure data. Findings from our proposed study represent an extraordinary opportunity to facilitate effective long-term management of MS, accelerate progress in the understanding of disease pathogenesis, predict patient trajectories and inform prevention strategies. We have assembled a team with strong expertise in clinical neurology/MS neurology, advanced epidemiologic methods, EHR structure and clinical care within a health maintenance organization, human genomics, biostatistics, and big data approaches.

"Sarcopenia: computable phenotypes and clinical outcomes. PROJECT SUMMARY  Sarcopenia is a generalized muscle condition that develops with aging and complicates many common chronic diseases, resulting in low muscle mass, weakness, and impaired physical function. Sarcopenia contributes to disability, increased hospitalizations, healthcare costs, and risk of death. Despite being under- recognized clinically, sarcopenia is a major public health concern, with the worldwide prevalence projected to increase by up to 72% in the next 30 years. However, limited knowledge of sarcopenia among clinicians, combined with time pressures in clinical encounters delay its detection, and limit opportunity for intervention or recruitment into clinical trials. To overcome this barrier to detecting sarcopenia, we propose to use advanced big data and machine learning methods to identify additional component variables predicting sarcopenia among the rich electronic health record (EHR) data and develop a validated and portable sarcopenia computable phenotype (which uses a computer algorithm to detect patient characteristics or outcomes from the EHR). This innovative proposal takes advantage of key resources at Indiana University and its affiliation with the Regenstrief Institute and the Indiana Network for Patient Care (INPC), a statewide multi-health system clinical data warehouse including >100 healthcare entities and >18 million unique patients with both coded and text-based data, combined with the ability to perform comprehensive musculoskeletal measurements in the Musculoskeletal Function Imaging and Tissue (MSK-FIT) Core funded through a NIAMS Core Center for Clinical Research grant (P30AR072581). Our long-term goal is to accurately identify patients with, or at risk for, sarcopenia and its consequences in order to provide targeted interventions. We hypothesize that by using medical informatics and machine learning innovations, computable phenotypes can identify patients with sarcopenia from the EHR, predict deficits in measured muscle strength and physical function, and prospectively predict risk of hospitalization and death. In Aim 1, we will categorize >2000 adult participants in the MSK-FIT Core with accessible EHR data, as either sarcopenic or nonsarcopenic according to measurements of muscle strength, muscle mass and physical performance. We will then use 75% of the MSK- FIT Core cohort to train machine deep learning algorithms to detect combinations of variables from these subjects’ EHR predicting whether the patient is sarcopenic or not sarcopenic. The performance of the resulting computable phenotype will then be tested in the remaining 25% of the MSK-FIT Core participants. In Aim 2, we will test the performance of the sarcopenia computable phenotype to detect a clinically meaningful phenotype in the entire INPC adult population (>18 million), by evaluating the ability to predict the rate of hospitalizations and death among patients rated as sarcopenic versus matched controls. Such a computable phenotype will then enable large scale targeted recruitment, pragmatic clinical trials, clinical evaluation and intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sarcopenia is a generalized muscle condition that develops with aging and complicates many common chronic diseases, resulting in low muscle mass, weakness, and impaired physical function, and contributing to disability, increased hospitalizations and risk of death.

"Prediction of Anti-Cancer Medication Discontinuation via Patient Portal Messages and Structured Electronic Medical Records Summary Cancer is a leading cause of morbidity in the United States, with more than half a million deaths estimated in 2019. Systemic cancer therapies are increasingly being designed as long-term oral anti-cancer medications, given the increased convenience of a self-administered regimen. For instance, patients with operable hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer are prescribed adjuvant oral hormonal therapy, with an expectation that they continue their regimen for a minimum of 5 years to maximize the benefits. Although many oral therapies have proven effective in mitigating cancer recurrence and mortality, discontinuation to these treatments are not uncommon. This is a concern because medication discontinuation before the completion of a prescribed treatment protocol leads to lower survival rates, increased risks of recurrence, and higher healthcare costs. To improve treatment adherence and promise better healthcare delivery, it is essential for healthcare providers to know when and why a cancer patient will discontinue their medications. While there have been various investigations into regimen discontinuation, the focus of these studies is either on knowledge discovery or intervention. While knowledge discovery focuses on characterizing the potential factors that lead to medication discontinuation, intervention aims to leverage discovered knowledge to design and test effective strategies to help patients adhere to treatments. Because there are thousands of cancer patients, it is impossible for healthcare providers to apply intervention to each of them. Limited medical resources need to be allocated efficiently, such that patients with a higher risk of discontinuing medications will receive greater, timely attention. Yet, the increasing integration of online communication and mobile computing technologies into the healthcare domain are generating massive quantities of patient-generated information. Thus, we propose to apply online patient-provider communications in a patient portal to supplement traditional EMR data to better understand a cancer patient’s medical experience. The central hypothesis of this project is that such communications together with structured EMRs can be applied to learn and forecast oral anti-cancer medication discontinuation. The specific aims of this project designed to test our central hypothesis are to 1) discover what has been communicated in a patient portal; 2) infer how patient portal messages and structured EMRs are associated with medication discontinuation; and 3) determine who are more likely to discontinue medications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply the messages in a patient portal and structured EMRs to investigate medication discontinuation for cancer patients. Project Narrative Many oral anti-cancer medications have proven effective in preventing cancer recurrence and mortality, however, treatment adherence to these oral medications, some of which are taken for years, can be challenging for cancer patients due to a variety of factors, including side effects and high costs. Since medication discontinuation can lead to lower survival rates, increased risk of recurrence, and higher healthcare costs, society will benefit from gaining a deeper understanding of the causes of medication discontinuation and knowing who are at a high risk of medication discontinuation. In this project, we will analyze the online communications between patients and healthcare providers in a patient portal and apply them as well as structured electronic medical records to predict medication discontinuation.",Prediction of Anti-Cancer Medication Discontinuation via Patient Portal Messages and Structured Electronic Medical Records,10151599,R37CA237452,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Attention ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Sampling Biases ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Communication ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health delivery systems ', ' health services delivery ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Probability ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Self Administration ', ' Self-Administered ', ' Semantics ', ' Societies ', ' Sociology ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Supervision ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' human subject ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' Oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' hormone therapy ', ' Endocrine Therapy ', ' Hormonal Therapy ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Oral ', ' Test Result ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' expectation ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Human Nature ', ' Human Characteristics ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cancer recurrence ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer-directed therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' discovery mining ', ' literature mining ', ' literature searching ', ' text mining ', ' text searching ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' patient cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' treatment compliance ', ' compliance behavior ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Process ', ' Adjuvant ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Consumption ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' high risk ', ' electronic structure ', ' treatment adherence ', ' Regimen ', ' Knowledge Discovery ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile technology ', ' Health Care Research ', ' healthcare research ', ' recruit ', ' Text Messaging ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' patient-clinician communication ', ' patient-doctor communication ', ' patient-provider communication ', ' patient engagement ', ' participant engagement ', ' patient portal ', ' anti-cancer ', ' anticancer ', ' hormone receptor-positive ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' side effect ', ' ']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R37,2021,386906,TN-05

"Development and Validation of Quantitative Anterior Segment OCT-based Methods to Evaluate Patients with Primary Angle Closure Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), the most severe form of primary angle closure disease (PACD), is a leading cause of permanent blindness worldwide. Gonioscopy, a qualitative and subjective angle assessment method, is the current clinical standard for diagnosing PACD despite its limited ability to quantify disease severity, especially in patients with early angle closure. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) is a quantitative and objective imaging-based method for assessing the angle. However, there are limited methods for clinicians to apply AS-OCT to the care of angle closure patients. The primary objectives of this K23 career development proposal are: 1) to demonstrate the benefit of a quantitative anterior segment OCT-based approach to evaluating patients with PACD and develop classification models for PACD based on AS-OCT measurements; and 2) to provide an academic glaucoma specialist with the training and mentored research experience necessary to conduct independent clinical research. Achieving these objectives will provide critical skills and experiences necessary to establish an independent research program focused on applying AS-OCT imaging to improve the clinical care of patients with PACD. The proposed K23 application will provide additional training in four vital areas: 1) epidemiology and mechanisms of chronic disease; 2) classification of disease and prediction of disease risk; 3) biostatistical methods for clinical research; 4) machine learning and automated data analysis. The proposed research will use population-based data collected as part of the NIH-funded Chinese American Eye Study (CHES) to compare AS-OCT and gonioscopic assessments of angle width and determine the strength of association between these assessments and known PACD risk factors. The relationship between the degree of angle closure, measured by AS-OCT, and intraocular pressure (IOP), a sequela of angle closure and strong risk factor for glaucoma, will be characterized with CHES data and validated with data obtained by using a novel pupil control system on PACD patients recruited from the USC Roski Eye Institute (USCREI). Classification models for PACD stage and severity based on AS-OCT data from CHES will be developed using machine learning algorithms and validated with prospective data from USCREI patients with PACD. The results of the proposed research will provide the foundation for a future longitudinal study examining the benefit of using anterior segment OCT-based assessments and classification models to evaluate PACD patients and deliver targeted treatment to patients with higher risk for PACG. The ultimate goal of my research is to develop quantitative imaging-based diagnostic and treatment protocols that guide the standardized care of PACD patients and decrease the incidence of PACG and its associated ocular morbidity. PROJECT NARRATIVE The management of angle closure patients at risk for primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), the most severe form of primary angle closure disease (PACD) and a leading cause of permanent vision loss worldwide, poses a significant challenge for eye care providers.

"Predicting the Presence of Clinically Significant Thyroid Cancer using Ultrasound Imaging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There has been significant work in creating tools that leverage computer vision algorithms to automate medical image analysis. Most of these algorithms have been developed for natural images, which are usually single static images that can be treated individually. However, medical images are usually part of a study that may include various views and orientations that are considered together with other clinical data when making a diagnosis. Three dimensional convolution neural networks (CNN) can address this issue in part when images are evenly spaced, but many medical imaging modalities such as ultrasound (US), fluoroscopy, and biopsy imaging have variable orientations and irregular spacing. Graph convolutional networks (GCN) have the potential to address this issue as they generalize the assumptions of CNNs to work on arbitrarily structured graphs. Automatic thyroid nodule detection in ultrasound (US) is one application that such a graph-based approach could have a large impact. The thyroid cancer incidence rate has tripled in the past thirty years, with an estimated cost of $18-21 billon in 2019. US is the imaging modality of choice, which consists of multiple 2D images of different locations and orientations. US readings are often vague and subjective in nature, which has resulted in a steady increase in the number of biopsies performed over the past 20 years. It is estimated that about one-third of all thyroid biopsy procedures performed in the United States are medically unnecessary, leading to the unmet need for noninvasive diagnostic tests that can reliably identify which nodules require a biopsy. The research objective of this R21 is to develop a new graph-based approach to leverage spatial information contained within imaging studies that will be combined with biomarkers and other known risk factors. Our graph model will enable more complete detection of thyroid cancer, as well as the prediction of future cancer aggression, both with spatially localized explanations. GCN features will be used to predict voxel-level cancer suspicion, thereby enabling a novel method for performing “imaging biopsy.” Finally, voxel-level suspicion maps will be aggregated into patient-level quantitative imaging biomarkers and combined with clinical data to create a multimodal nomogram for performing risk stratification. PROJECT NARRATIVE Medical image analysis plays an important role in computer aided detection and diagnosis, but usually focuses on individual images in isolation. Graph convolutional networks have the ability to utilize the relationships be- tween images in a study to aggregate information and make a more accurate evaluation. The focus of this project is to implement a graph-based approach for distinguishing indolent from aggressive thyroid cancer, thus pre- venting patients from receiving unnecessary treatment and incurring associated negative functional outcomes.",Predicting the Presence of Clinically Significant Thyroid Cancer using Ultrasound Imaging,10110934,R21EB030691,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Algorithms ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Attention ', ' Biopsy ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of thyroid ', ' Malignant Thyroid Gland Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Thyroid ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Thyroid Gland ', ' Thyroid Cancer ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Fluoroscopy ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Nodule ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Probability ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Savings ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Thyroid Gland ', ' Thyroid ', ' Thyroid Head and Neck ', ' Thyroid Nodule ', ' Thyroid Gland Nodule ', ' Tweens ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Indolent ', ' Individual ', ' noninvasive diagnosis ', ' non-invasive diagnosis ', ' non-invasive diagnostic ', ' noninvasive diagnostic ', ' radiologist ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Location ', ' Organ System ', ' body system ', ' cancer risk ', ' treatment planning ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' Modeling ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' ward ', ' Address ', ' Nomograms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' image registration ', ' functional outcomes ', ' cancer imaging ', ' oncologic imaging ', ' oncology imaging ', ' tumor imaging ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' network models ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' computer aided detection ', ' computer assisted detection ', ' Patient risk ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' patient stratification ', ' stratified patient ', ' unnecessary treatment ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' clinical imaging ', ' imaging study ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' cost estimate ', ' cost estimation ', ' detection platform ', ' detection system ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2021,224566,CA-33
"Risk and strength: determining the impact of area-level racial bias and protective factors on birth outcomes. PROJECT SUMMARY There are large and persistent racial and ethnic disparities in preterm birth and low birth weight. Individual-level risk factors do not fully explain the observed disparities. There is increasing evidence for the role of area-level racial bias in explaining these disparities, but we currently lack both the measures, methods, and findings to empirically evaluate its influence. The proposed research will advance the research in all 3 areas. We will be using online and social media data and machine learning models to create two measures of area-level racial bias and implement a robust research design to determine whether area-level racial bias impacts birth outcomes. Our investigative team—comprised of experts in the field of epidemiology, health disparities, machine learning, social media data, biostatistics, and community engaged research—is uniquely suited to implement the study aims. Our Specific Aims are to 1) track and detect changes in area-level racial bias and identify local and national race-related events during these time points, 2) determine the impact of changes in area-level racial bias on changes in adverse birth outcomes, and 3) identify protective factors for adverse birth outcomes. Because our data is collected repeatedly and finely across the United States, we can explicitly account for temporal trends and place effects. The proposed study uses new data to capture trends in racial bias with sophisticated machine learning models, and represents a critical advancement in the investigation of racial disparities in birth outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Individual-level risk factors are not fully explaining the large and persistent racial disparities in birth outcomes, limiting policy and intervention strategies to reduce these disparities.

"Optical Tomography and Decoding for Communication via Brain-Computer Interface Project Summary: The long-term goal of this research is to develop a new, non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) that will provide augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) capabilities to patients who have lost these capabilities due to severe motor impairments, such as completely locked-in syndrome (CLIS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and severe cerebral palsy (CP). The proposed research project will work towards a long-term goal by developing a BCI based on brain imaging signals from high-density diffuse optical tomography (HDDOT). Some existing BCIs record electroencephalography (EEG) or electrocorticography (ECoG) signals from patients and then decode these signals into instructions for operating some element of the outside world, such as a cursor on a screen, a prosthetic limb, or a virtual keyboard. This functionality can enable communication. However, BCI generally has had limited success and capabilities in CLIS patients with EEG or has relied on invasive technology such as ECoG or intracortical recordings, which require surgical placement of electrodes on or beneath the brain surface. Although functional MRI (fMRI) has recently achieved great success with decoding items viewed or heard by subjects (e.g., distinguishing from among >100 viewed images), fMRI requires bulky, expensive equipment that cannot be employed for routine BCI for patients with severe motor- related communication deficits. In contrast, optical imaging approaches, such as near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), employ portable, wearable hardware. These optical systems are non-invasive and use non-ionizing, near-infrared light to create movies of blood oxygenation and therefore provide physiological information comparable to the fMRI signal. NIRS has recently been applied as an alternative to EEG BCI for decoding simple yes/no responses in CLIS patients. However, NIRS systems suffer from much-lower spatial resolution than fMRI, which renders NIRS unlikely to match the decoding capabilities of fMRI. High-density diffuse optical tomography (HDDOT) combines the lightweight, low-cost equipment benefits of EEG and NIRS with higher spatial resolution closer to that of fMRI at the brain surface. Recent advances in HDDOT systems have enabled average spatial localization errors <5 mm and spatial resolution <17-20 mm (substantially better than NIRS). Studies have demonstrated detailed maps of both visual and language tasks. These properties make HDDOT an ideal candidate tool for decoding brain function. The fellowship training will provide a strong foundation in optical neuroimaging methods, machine learning, and brain-computer interface. These experiences will prepare the applicant exceptionally well for a career in biomedical engineering research and for developing technology that will improve these patients’ quality of life. Project Narrative: This project will develop decoding methods and evaluate their feasibility for using a high- performance optical brain scanner to identify and distinguish between imaging tasks in human subjects. The long-term goal of this research is to enable locked-in patients to communicate with others using augmented communication facilitated by a portable brain-scanning device, and a computer that decodes their brain signals.",Optical Tomography and Decoding for Communication via Brain-Computer Interface,10078847,F31NS110261,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ', ' Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Motor Neuron Disease ', "" Gehrig's Disease "", ' Lou Gehrig Disease ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bio-engineered ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bioengineering ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cerebral Palsy ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Color ', ' Communication ', ' Computers ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Elements ', ' Equipment ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Fellowship ', ' Foundations ', ' frontal lobe ', ' frontal cortex ', ' Goals ', ' Hearing ', ' Imagination ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Literature ', ' Locked-In Syndrome ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Patients ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Semantics ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Speech ', ' Technology ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Testing ', ' Travel ', ' Visual Cortex ', ' visual cortical ', ' Work ', ' Clip ', ' base ', ' career ', ' density ', ' human subject ', ' improved ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Surface ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Training ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Letters ', ' lightweight ', ' light weight ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Artificial Extremities ', ' Artificial Limbs ', ' prosthetic limb ', ' Limb Prosthesis ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NIR Spectroscopy ', ' Near-Infrared Spectrometry ', ' Near-Infrared Spectroscopy ', ' electrocorticography ', ' Electrocorticogram ', ' Frequencies ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Brain scan ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' movie ', ' Devices ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' portability ', ' Optical Tomography ', ' diffuse optical tomography ', ' AAC Device ', ' AAC Intervention ', ' Augmentative and Alternative Communication ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Resolution ', ' Collection ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Instruction ', ' cost ', ' optical imaging ', ' optic imaging ', ' virtual ', ' brain computer interface ', ' extrastriate visual cortex ', ' extrastriate area ', ' extrastriate cortex ', ' visual area ', ' mental imagery ', ' motor impairment ', ' movement impairment ', ' movement limitation ', ' non-invasive system ', ' noninvasive system ', ' imaging system ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' imaging approach ', ' imaging based approach ', ' ']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,29520,MO-01
"Precision Assessment Algorithm for Reducing Disaster-related Respiratory Health Disparities ABSTRACT Weather and climate disasters are responsible for over 13,000 deaths and $1.7 trillion additional costs over the last 40 years in the USA. Older adults are particularly susceptible to respiratory symptoms, disease exacerbation, unscheduled health care utilization, and decreased quality of life after disaster exposure to particulates, mold, and flooding. Our preliminary data reveal those with Black racial identities possess fewer resources to prepare for disaster. Profound racial disparities observed in the COVID-19 pandemic illustrate the devastating sequelae of long-standing macro-level disparities of segregated housing and sociopolitical networks. The long-term goal of this work is to eliminate racial disparities in large scale disaster health outcomes. The short-term goal of this research is to identify pathways of equal opportunity and disaster affirmative action interventions. The objective here is to create a software prototype of a machine learning algorithm with a novel, valid and reliable assessment tool of disaster vulnerability for older adults with chronic obstructive respiratory disease, prioritizing equality of opportunity to reduce racial bias and disparity. Our specific aims are to 1) Empirically validate a novel assessment tool of disaster vulnerability using self-reported items and scoring system, 2) Refine the validated instrument with a machine learning based algorithm for precision prediction of household emergency preparedness for disaster, 3) Assess racial disparities, data and algorithm bias for Black participants in household hazard vulnerabilities and our instrument development process, and 4) Test interoperability with existing customer software platforms as a plug-in software add-on. We will accomplish these aims using a mixed-methods approach, recruiting 20 expert panel members and up to 600 potential end-user participants, working to over-sample those who reside in predominantly Black communities and Black racial identities. The knowledge gained from this study will provide foundational work to develop precision interventions to reduce post-disaster respiratory symptoms, disease exacerbation, unscheduled health care utilization, and decrements in respiratory quality of life. The results of this study will inform the next generation of electronic health record and patient reported outcomes applications, ensuring the validity, prognostic accuracy, and machine learning models are most relevant to those at highest risk for racial disparities: those with Black racial identities. Health care providers can use our software tool to target and optimize disaster telehealth service lines and increase intervention precision to reduce disaster morbidity and mortality disparities. Our goal is to identify pathways of equal opportunity or precision affirmative action interventions to eliminate racial disparities in large scale disaster health outcomes. Here, we propose to create a software prototype of a machine learning algorithm with a valid and reliable measure to score household occupant disaster vulnerability for older adults with chronic obstructive respiratory disease, prioritizing mathematical modeling of equality of opportunity to reduce racial bias and disparity. Collecting and analyzing both qualitative and quantitative data, we aim to: 1) validate a novel assessment instrument, 2) test the instrument for precision prediction of household emergency preparedness for disaster, 3) assess racial disparities, data and algorithm bias for those with Black racial identities, and 4) test the interoperability of our novel software prototype with existing electronic health record platforms.",Precision Assessment Algorithm for Reducing Disaster-related Respiratory Health Disparities,10401726,R43MD017188,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Crime ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disasters ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Floods ', ' Flooding ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Hospitals ', ' Household ', ' Housing ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' disease of the lung ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"CRCNS: Resolving human face perception with novel MEG source localization methods A brief glimpse at a face quickly reveals rich multi-dimensional information about the person in front of us. How is this impressive computational feat accomplished? A recently revised neural framework for face processing suggests perception of face form information, i.e. face invariant features such as gender, age, and identity, are processed through the ventral visual pathway, comprising the occipital face area, fusiform face area, and anterior temporal lobe face area. However, evidence from fMRI remains equivocal about when, where, and how specific face dimensions of age, gender, and identity, are extracted. A key property of a complex computation is that it proceeds via stages and hence unfolds over time. We recently investigated the computational stages of face perception in a MEG study (Dobs et al., Nature Comms, 2019) and found that gender and age are extracted before identity information. However, this temporal information has yet to be linked to the spatial information available from fMRI because of limitations in current methods for spatial localization of MEG sources. Here, we propose to overcome these limitations and provide the full picture of how face computations unfold over both time and space in the brain by developing novel methods for localizing MEG sources, leveraging our team’s expertise in MEG and machine learning. In Aim 1 we will develop a new analytical MEG localization method called Alternating Projections that iteratively fits focal sources to the MEG data. In Aim 2 we will develop a novel data-driven MEG localization method based on geometric deep learning that reconstructs distributed cortical maps by learning statistical relationships in the non-Euclidean space of the cortical manifold. In Aim 3, we will first identify which method is most suitable to model human MEG face responses using fMRI face localizers as ground truth. We will then extract spatially and temporally accurate face processing maps to characterize the computational steps entailed in extracting age, gender, and identity information along the ventral visual pathway. A computationally precise characterization of the neural basis of face processing would be a landmark achievement for basic research in vision and social perception in humans. Insights into how face perception is accomplished in humans may further yield clues for how to improve AI systems conducting similar tasks. Further, the methods developed here may increase the power of MEG data to answer questions about the spatiotemporal trajectory of neural computation in the human brain. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it develops new brain imaging methods to improve the spatial and temporal resolution, and applies them to study visual processing of faces. The methods developed here will broaden our ability to answer questions about the spatiotemporal trajectory of neural computation in the human brain. In the field of vision, a principled understanding of the computational steps of face perception could lead to a better understanding of visual impairments.",CRCNS: Resolving human face perception with novel MEG source localization methods,10397180,R01EY033638,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communication ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Social Perception ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual impairment ', ' Diminished Vision ', ' Low Vision ', ' Partial Sight ', ' Reduced Vision ', ' Subnormal Vision ', ' vision impairment ', ' visually impaired ', ' Visual Pathways ', ' Gender ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Anterior ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Measurement ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' millimeter ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' visual processing ', ' human data ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Familiarity ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' face perception ', ' theories ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Process ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' reconstruction ', ' Face Processing ', ' facial processing ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' volunteer ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' fusiform face area ', ' operation ', ' temporal measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' cortex mapping ', ' cortical map ', ' cortical mapping ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' source localization ', ' human model ', ' model of human ', ' deep learning ', ' statistical learning ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' implementation tool ', ' ']",NEI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,249632,MA-07
"Strengthening the Quantitative Pipeline for Multidisciplinary Trauma Research in Cameroon PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Trauma is a leading cause of death and disability in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), particularly in Cameroon, where a higher burden of injury is reported compared to similar settings in the region. Injury research focused on prevention and improvements in trauma care, such as trauma Quality improvement (QI), have led to significant reductions in the burden of injury in high-income countries. Yet, there remain critical gaps in the current trauma research infrastructure in SSA due to limited training opportunities. The Sustainable Trauma Research, Education, and Mentorship Program (STREaM) will seek to fill this gap, building on an existing long-term partnership between the University of California and the University of Buea (Buea) to provide innovative training to Cameroonian post-graduate candidates with a focus on novel, cutting edge quantitative tools. STREaM Cameroon program will aspire to establish a cadre of graduate trainees with multidisciplinary expertise in Injury prevention and control, quality improvement, and quantitative methods that can address limitations posed by the time-dependent, dynamic, and incomplete nature of trauma-related data. The program will leverage recent advances in research methodologies, such as machine learning and implementation science, that are particularly suited to trauma research. STREaM Cameroon aims to accomplish the following objectives:1) Train a critical mass of multidisciplinary scientists in trauma research through MPH, PhD, and post-doctoral pathways who will form the foundation for an Injury Center at the Buea; 2) Develop and implement a combination of short, medium, and long-term quantitative and trauma research curricula co-taught by U.S. and Cameroonian faculty to sustainably strengthen existing offerings at the Buea; 3) Provide mentored research opportunities for trainees to apply quantitative skills to trauma QI projects utilizing the partnership’s existing research and data collection infrastructure in Cameroon; and 4) Integrate trainee scholars into a robust scientific network through existing international organizations and the creation of a Cameroonian Trauma Network to serve as an ongoing community of practice. During the five-year program, a total of 2 post docs, and eight PhD and Master’s level students per year will be trained using a team mentoring approach. Master’s and PhD students will take part in online courses throughout their training, administered through the University of California Berkeley and University of California San Francisco’s Clinical and Translational Science Institute. All students will participate in mentored research. Additionally, post-docs will spend one semester at Berkeley receiving in-person training to prepare them for faculty positions at Buea. Upon completion of the STReaM program, graduates will successfully engage in innovative, evidence-based research to improve the quality of trauma care and reduce the burden of injury among vulnerable populations in SSA. STReaM Cameroon graduates will thus be trained and equipped to mentor the next generation of scientists in trauma research, playing a critical role in influencing healthcare practices and policy locally and internationally. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite the significant burden and predicted future growth of trauma as a public health problem in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), there remains a gap in trauma research training and distinct limitations in quantitative offerings at institutions of higher education in the region. The proposed Sustainable Trauma Research and Mentorship (STREaM) program will train a cadre of multidisciplinary trainees at three educational levels (MPH, PhD, and post-doctoral) to create a critical mass of trauma researchers in Cameroon with knowledge of novel, cutting edge quantitative methodologies.

"A Model for Predicting 2-Year Risk of Incident Late Age-related Macular Degeneration PROJECT SUMMARY Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), in the dry or wet form, is the leading cause of vision loss in the developed countries. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) showed that specific antioxidant vitamin supplementation reduces the risk of progression from intermediate stages to late AMD and maintains visual acuity in approximately 25% of patients. While treatment of wet AMD with Intraocular injections can be effective in maintaining vision, such treatments are costly and may be associated with significant cardiovascular risks, or even progression of dry AMD. Hence, it is critical to identify patients at the earlier stages. Unfortunately, there is no effective, automated screening tool to accomplish this, and the patients themselves may be asymptomatic. The goal of this SBIR Direct-to-Phase II proposal is to provide such tool. We have demonstrated the feasibility of AMD screening software ‘iPredictTM’ by successfully identifying 98.1% of individuals with early or intermediate stage AMD. iPredictTM also successfully predicted which individuals would develop late AMD within one year with 87.8% accuracy and two years with 88.4% accuracy. iPredictTM has prototype components for image analysis and machine learning. We also developed a HIPAA compliant telemedicine platform which will enable iPredictTM to perform large-scale screening from remote and rural areas. In order to bring the product to market, these components need to be integrated and tested which is the aim of our proposed Direct-to-Phase II proposal. We aim to develop the finished product which will be ready for the market. We also aim to evaluate the efficacy of iPredictTM in a clinical setup. The AMD preventative market is estimated around $5.4 billion in the U.S. alone. iPredictTM will capture the major market share with its best accuracy and be the first prediction tool for AMD. We aim to commercialize iPredictTM for the screening and prevention of AMD, saving millions of citizens from blindness and reduced quality of life. With iPredictTM’s improvements in speed of delivery, cost of care, and ease of access, the product will be a significant addition to the healthcare system. The iPredictTM’s telemedicine platform will allow large-scale screening from remote/rural areas, primary care clinics, optometry offices and ophthalmology clinics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in its late forms, “dry” or “wet”, is the leading cause of blindness in developed countries. Early intervention and therapy can significantly reduce the progression of early to late AMD. Hence, the identification of patients with early AMD and referral to an ophthalmologist is critically needed to help prevent vision loss. To achieve this goal, we propose to develop an automated screening and prediction system that can be widely deployed to identify these individuals at risk of vision loss.",A Model for Predicting 2-Year Risk of Incident Late Age-related Macular Degeneration,10445126,R44EY031202,"['Antioxidants ', ' anti-oxidant ', ' Eye diseases ', ' eye disorder ', ' ophthalmopathy ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Ophthalmology ', ' Optometry ', ' Optometries ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Risk ', ' Savings ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Testing ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual Acuity ', ' Vitamins ', ' Treatment Cost ', ' Telemedicine ', ' rural area ', ' rural location ', ' rural region ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Individual ', ' Age related macular degeneration ', ' Age-Related Maculopathy ', ' age related macular dystrophy ', ' senile macular disease ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Ophthalmologist ', ' Nonexudative age-related macular degeneration ', ' Atrophic AMD ', ' Atrophic age-related macular degeneration ', ' Dry AMD ', ' Non-exudative age-related macular degeneration ', ' dry age-related macular degeneration ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' developed country ', ' developed nation ', ' developed nations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' HIPAA ', ' Kennedy Kassebaum Act ', ' PL 104-191 ', ' PL104-191 ', ' Public Law 104-191 ', ' United States Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ', ' Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ', ' Speed ', ' Prevention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Supplementation ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' efficacy evaluation ', ' efficacy analysis ', ' efficacy assessment ', ' efficacy examination ', ' evaluate efficacy ', ' examine efficacy ', ' prototype ', ' screening ', ' care costs ', ' Injections ', ' remote screening ', ' ']",NEI,"IHEALTHSCREEN, INC.",R44,2021,108049,NY-05
"NNLM Center for Data Science and Delivery of Data Services National Center for Data Science Abstract Scientific progress is impeded when researchers lack the knowledge and skills to engage in effective data management, reproducible research practices, and meaningful data sharing. A growing number of librarians are providing support for best practices in data management and data science, but there is still tremendous untapped potential across the library community. The Network of the National Library of Medicine (NNLM) Center for Data Science and Delivery of Data Services (NCDS) will coordinate national efforts to provide training and resources to increase capacity among librarians to support two of the National Library of Medicine’s strategic goals: 1) accelerate discovery and advance health by providing the tools for data-driven research, and 2) build a workforce for data-driven research and health. The NCDS team brings a broad set of data skills to this undertaking, as well as experience in successful development of institutional data support and in developing resources for, training, and mentoring librarians on the national level. The NCDS will work collaboratively with the NNLM’s Regional Medical Libraries, Offices and Centers (ROCs), draw upon extensive connections with national data organizations to increase outreach and partner on programming, and assemble an external advisory board with expertise in clinical informatics, bioinformatics, community engagement, machine learning, data ethics, and open science to solicit feedback on our efforts and to maintain awareness of a breadth of current data issues. The NCDS will partner with the National Evaluation Center (NEC) to better understand the needs of the communities we are serving, ensure that training, resources, and support are designed and delivered in ways that meet those needs, generate information on best practices, and evaluate the achievement of the program aims. The proposed education programs will emphasize careful curation of existing content over “reinventing the wheel” in order to build resources such as an online Data Roadmap for self-directed learning and a repository of curricular resources. The NCDS will also focus on support for knowledge application and consolidation, offering courses with coaching to assist in bringing knowledge into practice and training in coding followed by codeathons to consolidate knowledge. Other programming will include a series of unconferences to support community building and development of resources. We will develop a pipeline program to provide data librarianship internships to Library and Information Science and college students from communities currently underrepresented in the profession. The NCDS will take advantage of multiple channels to communicate, including website, blogs, and social media, as well as collaborating with the ROCs and external partner organizations for outreach. The NCDS will use a coordinated, data-driven, innovative approach, to build capacity for providing data services among health information professionals, and in this way facilitate efficient and reproducible research and promote greater collaboration.

"Risk stratification of uncomplicated type B aortic dissection using clinical and engineering analysis Project Summary  Type B Aortic Dissection (TBAD) is a lethal disease which occurs when a tear develops in the inner lining (intimal layer) of the aorta, causing the layers of the aortic wall to separate (dissect) creating “true” and “false” lumens. Complicated TBADs with presence of either organ malperfusion or aortic rupture have a high in-hospital mortality rate and require emergent surgical or endovascular therapy. Uncomplicated TBADs have been traditionally managed with optimal medical therapy (OMT) consisting of aggressive anti-hypertensive therapy and surveillance imaging. OMT results in low in-hospital mortality rates, but dismal long-term survival rates of 48- 66%, and overall intervention-free survival rates of less than 50% secondary to aortic aneurysm formation and rupture. These poor long-term outcomes support a paradigm change in the treatment of the uncomplicated TBADs. Thus, there is an urgent and unmet clinical need for promptly identifying those uncomplicated TBAD patients that will likely fail OMT in the acute phase, and thus benefit from early intervention such as Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair (TEVAR).  Therefore, the objective of this project is to develop a risk stratification model for predicting both failure of OMT and the optimal timing of intervention in uncomplicated TBAD patients. To achieve this goal, a retrospective analysis will be conducted for about 500 uncomplicated TBAD patients from the Emory Aortic Databank. Clinical and anatomic data will be harvested from the electronic medical record and image studies to identify predictors of OMT failure. Next, using the same patient database, a series of mechanical experiments will be performed to obtain hyperelastic and failure properties of the TBAD tissues, from which rupture/tear risk metrics will be developed. Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) analyses will be validated and applied to obtain “heat maps” of hemodynamic and wall stress fields. The risk indices will be consequently extracted. For patients with longitudinal imaging data, TBAD progression will be predicted using an integrated growth and remodeling (G&R) and dissection propagation model. Critical biomechanical parameters will be identified as potential predictors of OMT failure. Finally, machine learning (ML) techniques will be used to combine clinical and biomechanical predictors to develop a multi-factorial, personalized TBAD risk stratification model. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, we will recruit and perform a longitudinal follow-up study of 35 acute uncomplicated TBAD patients to validate our approach by comparing the ML-model- prediction results with actual clinical outcomes.

"Audio Generation and Optimization from Existing Resources for Patient Education Project Summary/Abstract Health literacy is vital to achieving and maintaining good health. Several national programs have emphasized this goal and its importance. Text is generally much more efficient and cost-effective for presenting healthcare information on a large scale than interactive tools and videos. Over the past decade, therefore, most medical information has been provided as text, e.g., via printed pamphlets or on websites. We are entering a new era where a new similarly effective mode of information dissemination is becoming increasingly available: audio accessed with mobile devices. Millions of households have and use smart speakers and virtual assistants and they are increasingly used by patients and consumers to gather information. Hospitals also plan to gradually integrate them among their tools. However, there exist few if any guidelines on optimal generation and use of audio. The overall goal of this project is to discover how to support the creation of optimal audio from existing text sources for consumer and patient education. To accomplish this, four aims are proposed. The first aim is to identify audio features that affect information comprehension and retention. Here, features in audio content and style (e.g., word frequency or grammatical complexity) of the underlying information will be tested for impact. In addition, two groups of features specific to the audio medium will be tested: the delivery features (e.g., speed and pauses) as well as meta-features (e.g., speaker characteristics such as gender or accent and bias in listeners). This first aim will rely on large-scale datasets, semi-automatically generated and augmented with user scores for comprehension gathered using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Statistical and machine learning approaches will be used to tease out the best features and combinations. The second aim focuses on discovering how to augment text for audio and finding the optimal combination of text and audio for information comprehension and retention. Different combinations will be tested online with MTurk participants using controlled user studies. The third aim is to update, test and provide the existing online free text editor to generate optimized audio. We will also start dissemination of the tool to potential users including API access to components. The project will conclude with a summative evaluation with representative consumers recruited at a local community health center and further dissemination of preferences, practical obstacles, and best practices for the medical community to help increase health literacy through this new, popular audio medium. If successful, this project will generate best practices for the medical community in using audio as an additional method for bringing healthcare information to the general public; it will provide an online, free tool to generate audio leveraging these best practices and will include API access so that other researchers can easily integrate tool components into their research and tools; and it will provide immediate practical lessons from working with consumers relevant for clinical practice. Project Narrative Improving health literacy is an important national goal and necessary for achieving and maintaining health. The increased adoption of smart speakers and virtual assistants by consumers and in medical settings has created novel opportunities to educate the population by delivering health information through audio or audio combined with text. Because few (if any) tools exist to improve content and generate optimal audio, we aim to discover supportive and adverse features of audio/text information provision and create a free, online software tool for optimizing health-related text with demonstrated impact on information comprehension and retention.",Audio Generation and Optimization from Existing Resources for Patient Education,10295641,R01LM011975,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Arizona ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Household ', ' Information Dissemination ', ' dissemination of results ', ' Methods ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Booklets ', ' Brochures ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' Work Simplification ', ' Writing ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Neighborhood Health Center ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Comprehension ', ' Guidelines ', ' improved ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Frequencies ', ' Source ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' Speed ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Modeling ', ' Accent ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Data ', ' Update ', ' Characteristics ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' health literacy ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' real world application ', ' information processing ', ' clinical practice ', ' application programming interface ', ' application program interface ', ' interactive tool ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' recruit ', ' intelligent personal assistant ', ' digital assistant ', ' intelligent assistant ', ' personal digital assistant ', ' virtual assistant ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' clinical encounter ', ' open source tool ', ' open source toolkit ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2021,257905,AZ-03
"Using artificial intelligence to enable early identification and treatment of peripheral artery disease ABSTRACT The purpose of this award is to provide Dr. Elsie Ross, Assistant Professor of Surgery (Vascular Surgery) and Medicine (Biomedical Informatics Research) at Stanford University, the support necessary to transition her from a junior investigator into an independent surgeon-scientist in translational biomedical informatics. Dr. Ross is a vascular surgeon with an advanced degree in health services research and postdoctoral training in biomedical informatics. Her long-term goal is to combine her interdisciplinary training to develop and implement machine learning tools that will enable the delivery of precise, high-value care to patients with cardiovascular diseases. Her career development activities focus on advancing her ability to translate informatics discoveries into viable clinical tools by 1) completing didactic courses to deepen and expand her knowledge of deep learning algorithms, clinical trials and implementation science, 2) designing and conducting her first independent human subjects clinical research study evaluating the performance of machine learning technology, 3) implementing and evaluating the effects of an electronic health record (EHR)-based screening tool to identify latent vascular disease, and 4) strengthening her previous training in cost-effectiveness analysis to enable her future aim of evaluating the associated costs and utility of pro-active, automated disease screening. The candidate has convened a mentorship team that includes Dr. Nigam Shah, a biomedical informatics expert who combines machine learning, text-mining and medical ontologies to enable a learning health care system; Dr. Kenneth Mahaffey a world-expert in cardiovascular clinical trials; and Dr. Paul Heidenreich, an expert in implementation sciences with a focus on the use of EHR interventions to improve care quality for cardiovascular patients and evaluating the cost-effectiveness of new technologies. The research proposal builds on the candidate's prior work with using machine learning and EHR data to evaluate and predict cardiovascular disease outcomes. The candidate now proposes to characterize the performance of machine learning algorithms in identifying patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) using EHR data (Aim 1), evaluate whether learned classification models perform better than traditional risk factors for identification of undiagnosed PAD in a prospective patient cohort (Aim 2), and implement an EHR-based screening tool to identify patients with undiagnosed PAD and evaluate the diagnosis and treatment effects (Aim 3). Completion of the proposed research will result in a novel, EHR-based screening tool for identification of undiagnosed vascular disease that can decrease PAD-related cardiovascular morbidity and mortality through earlier and more aggressive medical management. This research will also form the basis for an R01 application before the end of the award to conduct a multi-site randomized-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the impact of EHR- based proactive PAD screening. ! ! ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Peripheral artery disease is a prevalent yet under-diagnosed condition that can lead to limb loss, stroke, heart attacks and/or premature death.

"Improved Glaucoma Monitoring Using Artificial-Intelligence Enabled Dashboard Detecting functional and structural loss due to glaucoma is critical to making treatment decisions with the goal of preserving vision and maintaining quality of life. However, most of the approaches for glaucoma assessment through visual fields (VFs) or optical coherence tomography (OCT) measurements have several limitations that poses critical challenge to their clinical utility. Identifying glaucoma-induced changes from a sequence of VF or OCT data is challenging either if the patients is in the early stages of the disease with subtle manifested structural and functional signs or if the patients are in the later stages of the disease with significant VF variability and OCT flooring effect. A major limitation of the current glaucoma monitoring techniques is that they generate a binary outcome of whether the glaucoma is worsening or not while current high-throughput data (e.g., OCT) has more information than a binary outcome. Another major drawback of some of these approaches is that they rely on traditional paradigms for progression detection such as linear regression. However, rates of glaucomatous progression may be non-linear and rapid, particularly during the later stages of the disease. Another limitation is that ad-hoc rules are adopted to define glaucoma progression while objective criteria are required to define thresholds for progression. Finally, a major deficiency of most of these methods is that they lack advanced visualization and interpretation. We propose to address these limitations by developing artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled visualization tools for effectively monitoring the functional and structural loss in patients with glaucoma. This approach provides qualitative and quantitative means to monitor 1) global visual functional and structural worsening, 2) extent of loss in hemifields, and 3) local patterns of functional and structural loss on advanced 2-D visualization tools. To achieve these objectives, we have assembled a team of interdisciplinary experts with access to large clinically annotated glaucoma data. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that advanced interpretable machine learning applied to a complete profile of VFs in all test locations (e.g., 54 in 24-2 system) and OCT-derived measurements of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) (e.g., 768 A-scans around the optic disc and 7 global sectoral regions) can objectively and automatically learn and quantify the most important features, yielding a more specific and sensitive means for monitoring of glaucoma worsening than current subjectively-specified or statistically-identified approaches. We also hypothesize that machine learning can provide interpretable models with several layers of glaucoma knowledge that may provide a promising complement to current glaucoma assessment tests. Our proposed studies may offer substantial improvements in prognosis and management of glaucoma through effective use of analysis and visualization to improve glaucoma management and making more informed treatment options. Current glaucoma assessment is hampered by several limitations including lack of visualization and interpretation, providing binary rather than more-informed results, utilizing traditional approaches for data analysis, and adopting ad-hoc assessment criteria. Glaucoma is best managed and treated if both functional and structural data is utilized and mined using advanced computational tools to generate more-informative quantitative results. We propose developing artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled visualization dashboards for qualitative and quantitative monitoring of global visual functional and structural worsening, extent of loss in hemifields, and local patterns of functional and structural loss on advanced interpretable 2-D and 3-D visualization maps.",Improved Glaucoma Monitoring Using Artificial-Intelligence Enabled Dashboard,10242048,R21EY031725,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Axon ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Computer Systems ', ' computing system ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Floor ', ' Glaucoma ', ' glaucomatous ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Learning ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Ophthalmology ', ' Optic Disk ', ' Optic Nerve Head ', ' Optic Papilla ', ' Optic Nerve ', ' Cranial Nerve II ', ' Second Cranial Nerve ', ' Patients ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Retinal Ganglion Cells ', ' retinal ganglion ', ' Savings ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual Fields ', ' eye field ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment Cost ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Visual ', ' Measurement ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Principal Component Analyses ', ' Principal Component Analysis ', ' Severities ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Location ', ' Test Result ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' high-end computing ', ' High Performance Computing ', ' Structure ', ' glaucoma test ', ' Modeling ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Monitor ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' Visualization software ', ' visualization tool ', ' Outcome ', ' retinal nerve fiber layer ', ' RNFL ', ' treatment strategy ', ' hands-on learning ', ' applied learning ', ' interactive engagement ', ' interactive learning ', ' Big Data to Knowledge ', ' BD2K ', ' dashboard ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' preservation ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' multidimensional data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' Visualization ', ' three-dimensional visualization ', ' 3-D visualization ', ' 3-dimensional visualization ', ' 3D visualization ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' Prognosis ', ' open source tool ', ' open source toolkit ', ' ']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,R21,2021,191826,TN-09
"Development of Accurate and Interpretable Machine Learning Algorithms for their application in Medicine Project Summary  The objective of this proposal is to provide a robust course of training for Gilmer Valdes, PhD, DABR, a candidate with an excellent foundation in clinical and machine learning research, to enable him to become an independent investigator. The proposed research aims to address a tradeoff between interpretability and accuracy of modern machine learning algorithms which limits their use in clinical practice. The candidate’s central hypothesis is that the current tradeoff is not a law of nature but rather a limitation of current interpretable machine learning algorithms. Towards proving this hypothesis, the candidate, leading a multidisciplinary team, have developed unique mathematical frameworks (MediBoost and the Conditional Interpretable Super Learner) to build interpretable and accurate models. The proposed research will I) implement and extensively benchmark these frameworks and II) use the algorithms develop to solve three clinical problems where potentially suboptimal models are currently used to make clinical decisions: 1) predicting mortality in the Intensive Care Unit, 2) predicting risk of Hospital Acquired Venous Thromboembolism, 3) predicting which prostate cancer patients benefit the most from adjuvant radiotherapy. The candidate’s training and research plan, multidisciplinary by nature, takes advantage of the proximity of UC San Francisco, Stanford and UC Berkeley and proposes a training plan that cannot be easily replicated elsewhere. Recognizing the multidisciplinary nature of the work proposed, the author will be mentored and work closely with a stellar committee from three institutions and different scientific areas (Machine Learning, Biostatistics, Statistics, Hospital Medicine, Cancer Research and Quality Assurance in Medicine): Jerome H. Friedman PhD (Stanford Statistics Department), Mark Van der Laan PhD (Berkeley Biostatistics and Statistics Department), Mark Segal (UCSF Epidimiology and Biostatistics Deparments), Andrew Auerbach MD (UCSF Medicine Department), Felix Y. Feng MD (UCSF Radiation Oncology),and Timothy D. Solberg PhD (UCSF Radiation Oncology). This committee will be coordinated by Dr Solberg. The candidate also counts with a strong a multidisciplinary team of collaborators. Successful completion of the proposed research will develop the next generation of accurate and interpretable Machine Learning algorithms and solve three important clinical problems where linear models are currently used in clinical settings. This proposal has wide-ranging implications across the healthcare spectrum. The intermediate-term goal is for the candidate to acquire the knowledge, technical skills and expertise necessary to submit a successful R01 proposal. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current state of the art machine learning algorithms have a marked tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability. In medicine, where errors can have a dire consequence and knowledge representation and validation is as relevant as accuracy, the development of accurate and interpretable algorithms is of paramount importance.

"Digital Therapeutic Development of Virtual Cognitive-Affective Training for Opioid Use Disorder Project Summary: The US is experiencing an opioid crisis, with an estimated 2.5 million Americans meeting full criteria for opioid use disorder (OUD). Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) like buprenorphine are currently the most effective form of intervention for OUD. In spite of the proven efficacy of MOUD, nearly half of people who begin a MOUD relapse within six months. As such, novel and efficacious behavioral adjuncts to MOUD are needed to improve treatment outcomes. Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE), a cognitive-affective training intervention generated through a NIDA-funded treatment development process has shown significant promise, demonstrating therapeutic effects in four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) by reducing opioid use and misuse and modulating neurophysiological responses during drug cue-reactivity and natural reward processing. However, the MORE intervention requires significant human interaction and is therefore resource intensive. Further, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, people with OUD may be reticent to engage in face-to-face interventions due to the risk of viral spread. To overcome these implementation barriers and increase access to treatment, the proposed project will develop and test a virtual reality version of the MORE intervention (MORE-VR) built on BehaVR LLC's VR existing, commercially available platform, the Dynamic eXperience Engine (DXE). The DXE uses machine learning to integrate biometrics into the VR experience to personalize addictions treatment, boosting patient engagement and optimizing the efficacy of clinical intervention. In Phase I, we will develop and test the MORE-VR prototype in a single arm clinical study of OUD patients receiving buprenorphine in an opioid treatment program (OTP), focusing on patient safety and engagement. If the prototype is perceived to have adequate usability and Net Promoter Scores, as well as to produce improvements in proximal measures of craving and affective state, the project will progress to Phase II. In Phase II, we will first develop the MORE-VR Minimal Viable Program using feedback from our Phase I study to optimize the intervention, and then conduct a RCT of MORE-VR vs. MOUD treatment as usual. Our robust and unbiased research design will triangulate clinical outcome measurement with biochemical verification of abstinence, ecological momentary assessments (EMA), and neurophysiological assessment of cue-reactivity. Further, we will integrate the MORE-VR Program into the OTP operational environment, building Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources interfaces to ingest patient data from electronic medical records (EMRs) and to export patient utilization, assessment, and biometric data back to EMRs to create patient records and inform clinicians of patient progress. Activities in Phase I and Phase II will help define the regulatory pathway and establish regulatory feasibility to precede Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the MORE-VR system as a Class II medical device. In sum, this project will translate an evidence- based biobehavioral treatment approach into an innovative digital therapeutic for OUD. Project Narrative Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) like buprenorphine are currently the most effective form of intervention for opioid use disorder (OUD); however, novel behavioral adjuncts are needed to remediate dysregulation in brain reward systems, enhance MOUD adherence, and prevent relapse.

"Disease, Disability and Death in an Aging Workforce ABSTRACT The overarching goal of the “Alcoa Study” remains the development of increasingly rich models to explain the disparate health and work-capacity trajectories demonstrated in this universally insured, geographically, socially and economically diverse cohort of 200,000+ men and women as they progress from work-life into retirement. Outcomes of focus remain incident chronic disease and its progression, disability, retirement decisions, health in retirement, and mortality. During the current grant cycle we have augmented the infrastructure and data linkages to our already unique data set, such that we now have access to 1) early life social context via Census data; 2) personal and family work experience and income across the life span via IRS and SSA; 3) post-Alcoa health and mortality via Medicare and the National Death Index (NDI) and 4) contextual social environment from lifetime residential geocoding. Consequently, we propose in the next cycle to embrace a life course approach to study the social, environmental and behavioral determinants of the outcomes listed above The specific aims of this grant are: Aim 1: Link Alcoa workers to individual census records to examine how early life environment influences later life health outcomes; Aim 2: Assess the impact on health and function of adverse working environment as it accrues during work-life, with an emphasis on ubiquitous physical hazards; Aim 3: Identify antecedents of short-term and long-term disability across working life as candidates for subsequent hypothesis testing; Aim 4: Assess the impact disability benefits have on employee work function and health; Aim 5: Examine how injuries and health shocks affect retirement savings and subsequent health trajectories; Aim 6: To address generalizability across studies and populations, compare the Alcoa population to relevant complementary datasets, administrative and survey. Viewed altogether, continuation of the Alcoa study with the assembled team of investigators provides an unparalleled opportunity to address a host of critical empiric and methodologic issues previously unapproachable. In addition to understanding better which occupational exposures contribute to chronic disease and disability, these data will allow us to control for economic and other contextual factors to an extraordinary degree. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Alcoa research infrastructure—linking quantitative exposure measures to myriad hazards of active workers whose behavior, social environment and health status from pre-employment through retirement to death are fully observed—provides a unique opportunity to extend our work on the outcomes of focus including incident chronic disease and its progression, disability, retirement decisions, health in retirement, and mortality. During the current grant cycle we have augmented the infrastructure and data linkages to our already unique data set, such that we now have access to early life social context, personal and family work experience and income and post-Alcoa health and mortality via Medicare and the National Death Index (NDI).","Disease, Disability and Death in an Aging Workforce",10252758,R01AG026291,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Behavior ', ' Censuses ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Employment ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' indexing ', ' Learning ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Occupational Exposure ', ' workplace exposure ', ' Privatization ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Records ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Retirement ', ' Risk ', ' Savings ', ' Shock ', ' Circulatory Collapse ', ' circulatory shock ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' United States Department of Veterans Affairs ', ' United States Veterans Administration ', ' Veterans Administration ', ' Veterans Affairs ', ' Veterans ', ' Vietnam ', ' Viet Nam ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Occupational Health ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' Link ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Compensation ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Data Linkages ', ' Record Linkage Study ', ' Policies ', ' uptake ', ' Disability Insurance ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Occupational ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' experience ', ' hazard ', ' cohort ', ' Employee ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' high risk ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' disability impact ', ' Infrastructure ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,713126,CA-18
"Health Inequality and a Machine Learning-Based Tool for Emergency Department Triage: A Mixed Methods Approach Project Summary There is growing evidence that artificial intelligence (AI) technologies like machine learning (ML) can perpetuate or even worsen social inequalities when deployed into real-world settings. This has been demonstrated in many realms, including policing, the court system, banking, social services provision, and there is growing concern the same is true in medicine. At the same time, there has been an outpouring of new AI-based interventions, with a ten-fold increase in the number of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals for AI-based technologies since 2017. However, little research empirically examines the health equity implications of ML-based clinical decision-making tools. One clinical arena in which ML-based tools are already in use is emergency department (ED) triage, as an alternative to the common Emergency Severity Index (ESI) system. Despite its widespread popularity, evidence has shown that ESI-based triage has many problems, including poor acuity discrimination, with up to 50% of patients triaged at the midpoint of the scale, and is associated with racial inequalities, with African-American patients experiencing longer wait-times and lower triage levels controlling for illness severity. This study will use an ML-based ED triage tool that is already in use at a major academic medical center in the United States to explore the extent to which several factors are associated with inequality in predictive performance across patient racial/ethnic groups. This research will take a mixed methods approach to concurrently examine both human and ‘machine’ elements that affect the triage tool’s final impact on patients. Aim 1 will be a qualitative study involving ethnographic observation and semi-structured interviewing of triage nurses, to develop a conceptual framework for clinicians’ understanding of and interaction with an ML-based tool. Aim 2 will examine ‘label bias’, a type of measurement bias. The Applicant will use synthetic and real electronic health record (EHR) data and simulate different levels of label bias, then examine predictive performance of the triage tool across patient racial/ethnic groups. Aim 3 will explore different methods for imputing missing EHR data. The Applicant will deploy common, simplistic deletion-based methods as well as a promising new ML-based imputation method called an autoencoder, apply the triage model to generate predictions and examine performance across patient racial/ethnic groups. This project is innovative because it contributes to the development of a ‘life cycle’ model of ML-based tools and their health equity implications using a mixed methods approach that integrates both human and computational elements, while also providing a rigorous training plan for the Applicant, an MD-PhD student in epidemiology. This training plan is rigorous, synergistic yet diverse, and will include advanced coursework, dedicated 1-on-1 and group mentoring with experts in the field, attendance at seminars and targeted conferences, integration with clinical education and professional development. This project will be an essential step toward the Applicant’s maturation into an independent physician-scientist. Project Narrative This proposal represents a significant contribution to public health in that it seeks to improve upon current emergency department (ED) triage processes, which are associated with racial inequalities in wait time and triage severity. Specifically, this research will evaluate the performance of an alternative machine learning (ML) -based tool for ED triage across racial/ethnic groups, contributing to a more accurate and equitable triaging of patients and directly improving patient health outcomes. More broadly, this project will enhance the ability of many stakeholders, including data scientists, clinicians, researchers and health policy-makers to evaluate the health equity impacts of any proposed ML-based interventions for health.",Health Inequality and a Machine Learning-Based Tool for Emergency Department Triage: A Mixed Methods Approach,10248299,F31LM013403,"['Critiques ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Elements ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Medicine ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Ethnic People ', ' Ethnic Population ', ' Ethnicity People ', ' Ethnicity Population ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' University Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Literature ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Minority People ', ' Minority Population ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Triage ', ' United States ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' USFDA ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Police ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' African American ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Ethnography ', ' ethnographic ', ' base ', ' court ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Training ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Measurement ', ' Inequality ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Empirical Research ', ' Scientist ', ' Severities ', ' System ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' computer science ', ' Structure ', ' social inequality ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Adjuvant ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' ethnoracial ', ' health equity ', ' health inequalities ', ' Health Inequity ', ' Inequalities in Health ', ' Inequities in Health ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' doctoral student ', ' Ph D student ', ' Ph D. student ', ' Ph.

"Using deep brain stimulation of the parietal cortex to investigate the electrophysiology of human episodic memory Project Summary Our proposal seeks to build upon the success of our lab investigating the electrophysiology of human memory through novel experiments that will elucidate hippocampal—parietal interactions in memory processing. The key innovations of this proposal are the application of direct brain stimulation to the mesial parietal cortex and the adaptation of an associative recognition paradigm to intracranial data. We will take advantage of our high-volume epilepsy surgical center specializing in stereo EEG electrode implantation. In our first aim, we will compare how electrophysiological patterns of brain activation differ between free recall (which comprises the bulk of intracranial memory data) and associative recognition, specifically examining properties of theta oscillations in the anterior versus posterior hippocampus. In the second aim, we will apply deep brain stimulation to the mesial parietal cortex during memory encoding and retrieval, observing differences in memory performance and hippocampal oscillatory activity that will inform hypotheses of how this area supports episodic memory. In Aim 3, we will use machine learning classifiers to understand how mesial parietal stimulation affects memory performance via its impact on brain oscillatory activity in a responsive stimulation paradigm. These experiments will utilize our lab’s knowledge and infrastructure gained through participation in the DARPA Restoring Active Memory project. While our proposal is highly innovative, our center’s proven success in recruiting a large volume of stereo EEG patients for memory research, data collection, and the application of advanced analytic techniques give us confidence that we will collect high quality data addressing the critical gaps in the understanding of human memory. Project Narrative Two critical gaps in our understanding of human memory are whether or not hippocampal theta oscillations support encoding in the same manner as in rodents, and the contribution of the mesial parietal cortex in encoding versus retrieval. These questions are closely linked together, and we propose to study them in stereo EEG patients using a novel memory paradigm coupled with deep brain stimulation. Our planned experiments include a closed-loop stimulation paradigm seeking to use parietal stimulation to improve memory performance, the results of which will both inform theories of human episodic memory processing and of the design of therapeutic brain stimulation devices to treat cognitive deficits.",Using deep brain stimulation of the parietal cortex to investigate the electrophysiology of human episodic memory,10348398,R01NS107357,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Anterior ', ' Area ', ' Animal Experiments ', ' Link ', ' analog ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Attenuated ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Deep Brain Stimulation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Parietal ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' memory recognition ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Episodic memory ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' memory processing ', ' memory process ', ' memory retrieval ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' memory decline ', ' Memory Loss ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' Brain region ', ' Effectiveness ', ' degenerative condition ', ' degenerative disease ', ' Degenerative Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Retrieval ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' direct application ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' implantation ', ' human disease ', ' memory encoding ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic strategies ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' human imaging ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', ' advanced analytics ', ' learning classifier ', ' ']",NINDS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,79818,TX-30
"The effects of film music on neural activity in higher-order brain areas and comprehension for the film narrative Music is a powerful memory cue that can reliably transport us to our past -- in  effect, strengthening the associative bond between our present and our past. Modern  neuroscientific investigations of episodic memory could benefit from the use of music due to its  role as a potent memory cue. In this proposal, my goal is to understand how music shapes memory   for past events and how these associations between events are represented in the brain.  The proposed work builds on recent functional MRI studies that have used naturalistic experimental  paradigms such as movie watching and recall to test and refine theories of memory  that (previously) had only been tested under highly-controlled conditions. Here we explore how film  scores shape memory for movies. In movies, film scores sometimes have recurrent structure where a  particular theme song will be repeated throughout, potentially bringing back to mind information  from previous events in which that theme song had been played. Based on prior work showing   that retrieval of a memory strengthens that memory, we predict that the presence of  recurrent musical structure in a film will trigger retrieval of previous events during  movie-watching, which (in turn) will boost memory for these events on a later recall test. In our  study, two groups of participants are recruited: The first group watches a version of a movie in  its original form (with the film score intact) and the control group watches the same film with the  entire film score removed (while preserving dialogue and ambient sounds). Participants from both  groups are asked to return the following day to recall the entire movie in chronological order. By  comparing neural activity between scenes containing music and previous scenes containing the same  (or similar) music between the two groups, we expect to find evidence of neural reinstatement of  past scenes in the music group; furthermore, we predict that higher levels of reinstatement during  movie-viewing will be associated with better subsequent recall of the movie in the music group  relative to the control group. This work will provide basic-science insight into how memory works  in real-world contexts. It will also shed light on how musical cues can strengthen memories and  improve recall; if the predicted cueing effects are observed, these techniques could be used in  future work to boost performance in memory-impaired clinical populations. The effects of music on memory in naturalistic settings are not yet well understood. In this  project, we aim to study how memory for films is affected by the presence or absence of the film  score and whether these effects can be measured neurally. This work will help develop new  neural measures of music-evoked episodic memory as well as expand our understanding of music's  effect on memory under natural conditions.",The effects of film music on neural activity in higher-order brain areas and comprehension for the film narrative,10334404,F99NS118740,"['Affect ', ' Association Learning ', ' Award ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Chronology ', ' Control Groups ', ' Cues ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hearing ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infant ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Memory ', ' Modernization ', ' Music ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Play ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' sound ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Film ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Phase ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Distant ', ' Sensory ', ' Techniques ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' Episodic memory ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' memory retrieval ', ' memory recall ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' movie ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' theories ', ' portability ', ' Data ', ' Retrieval ', ' Behavioral ', ' Behavioral Paradigm ', ' markov model ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' preservation ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' learning algorithm ', ' ']",NINDS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,F99,2021,47036,NJ-12
"Data Driven Approaches to Improving Risk Prediction of Pulmonary Complications After Major Inpatient Surgery ABSTRACT BACKGROUND: Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) are common and major drivers of morbidity and mortality after major inpatient surgery. Various risk prediction scores identify patients at high risk of developing PPCs and observational research has connected peri-operative care practices with subsequent risk. However, anesthesia providers do not have patient specific evidence based interventions to prevent pulmonary complications. RESEARCH: The proposed research will draw on a wealth of perioperative information available to identify the interactions of patient, procedure and process of care factors which place patients at risk of PPCs. This will incorporate advances in data science to the pre-operative prediction of PPCs (Aim 1). We will then revise and improve this estimate in light of the high fidelity intraoperative data stream from ventilators, monitors and patient response to real life decisions being made during the delivery of anesthesia care (Aim 2). This will allow understanding of what features most contributed to patient specific risk (Aim 3). The proposed research and training will provide Dr Colquhoun with the skills in data science to his transition to an independent researcher. CANDIDATE: Dr Douglas A Colquhoun is a tenure track Assistant Professor of Anesthesiology at the University of Michigan. He is board certified in Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine and maintains an active clinical practice in the perioperative care of patients undergoing major surgery. During a T32 Research Training Grant, Dr Colquhoun developed expertise in the derivation of outcomes and processes of care from electronic medical record data. His long term career goal is to prevent postoperative pulmonary complications by offering anesthesia providers data driven strategies for management delivered at the point of care. ENVIRONMENT: The University of Michigan is the coordinating center for the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group (MPOG) an international consortium of 50 anesthesiology and surgical departments with perioperative information systems. Sachin Kheterpal, MD, MBA is the primary mentor for Dr. Colquhoun, and is the Director for MPOG. Dr Kheterpal and the Department of Anesthesiology have a rich history of developing and deploying innovative software solutions to address problems in perioperative medicine and research. Dr Colquhoun will additionally be advised from expert co-mentors drawn from across the institution and a scientific advisory panel expert in the prevention and management of postoperative complications. PROJECT NARRATIVE Postoperative Pulmonary Complications are common, costly and drivers of major inpatient morbidity. While risk models predict patients who may be at risk, few evidenced based management strategies exist, this approach has not been updated in light of the wealth of EHR derived data now available in contemporary practice.

"Anticoagulant use, safety, and effectiveness for venous thromboembolism prevention in inflammatory bowel disease patients PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There is a profound need to improve venous thromboembolism [VTE] treatment and prevention, particularly in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]. This Pathway to Independence Award application is submitted by a pharmacoepidemiologist committed to improving VTE prevention and treatment in populations who are often excluded or vastly under-represented in randomized clinical trials [RCTs]. Of the 3 million Americans affected by IBD, ~1–7% will develop VTE, a significant source of morbidity and mortality, in both the outpatient and inpatient settings. While attention has been paid to the role of anticoagulants for VTE prevention in IBD patients, there are key barriers to prescribing anticoagulants in this population including: (1) absence of data on the effectiveness of anticoagulants for the prevention of VTE in IBD patients; (2) fear of bleeding complications; and (3) lack of evidence on the safety of anticoagulants in high-risk subgroups such as patients with active disease flares or postpartum IBD patients, who are at an increased risk of adverse complications. The overarching goal of this research is to evaluate the use, effectiveness, and safety of anticoagulants in IBD patients in the inpatient and outpatient settings. The applicant will achieve the proposed aims of this K99/R00 award under the guidance of established researchers who span the disciplines of epidemiology, biostatistics, gastroenterology, and hematology at the University of Pennsylvania. First, the applicant will use a combination of machine learning and advanced methodological techniques to examine predictors of use, effectiveness, and safety of anticoagulants in the inpatient setting (K99 phase). In the R00 phase, the applicant will use linked electronic health records/claims database to examine the comparative effectiveness and safety of direct oral anticoagulants, warfarin, and heparins in IBD patients in the outpatient setting. The research proposed in this K99/R00 is critical since it provides timely needed information on the risks and benefits of anticoagulants in IBD patients, data that will not be forthcoming from large RCTs in the foreseeable future. The proposed career development and training goals will provide the applicant with training in predictive modeling, time-varying adjustment, and machine learning. The successful completion of the proposed training, infrastructure, and institutional support at the University of Pennsylvania will guarantee the applicant's success and transition to scientific independence. PROJECT NARRATIVE Randomized clinical trials of anticoagulants vastly under-represented patients with inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] despite their increased risk of venous thromboembolism [VTE].

"Personalized Rejection Risk Assessment in Cardiac Transplantation Project Summary: Cardiac allograft rejection (CAR) is a serious concern in transplant medicine, representing the leading threat to short- and long-term allograft survival. As a result, CAR surveillance and prevention is a primary focus of post-transplant care, with recipients undergoing frequent, scheduled, surveillance endomyocar- dial biopsy (EMB) for histologic CAR grading along with frequent, scheduled de-escalation of immunosuppres- sion (IS). The uniformity of this standardized approach to CAR mitigation is the result of an inability to employ reliable, proactive, and tailored strategies based on individual CAR risk. Consequently, patients at low CAR risk are exposed to unnecessary EMB procedures and excess IS therapy, while patients at high risk experience inadequate CAR surveillance and early/inappropriate weaning of IS. This exposes patients to potential harm, and highlights the clear, unmet need for precision CAR risk-assessment tools. The overarching premise for this proposal is that contained within the clinical data and EMB tissues already collected as part of usual care at transplant centers exists the means to provide actionable CAR risk assessments. Extensive immunologic, diag- nostic, and pharmacologic data are captured in electronic health records (EHR) at transplant centers, while large collections of EMB histology samples are stored (and often digitized) in pathology archives. This proposal seeks to utilize advanced machine-learning algorithms and in-situ diagnostic methods to deeply mine these archival resources for the purpose of validating novel CAR risk-prediction models. In Aim 1, we will leverage our experi- ence with automated histologic analysis pipelines to develop a ‘morphologic model’ for predicting future CAR using archived H&E slides. Hematoxylin-and-Eosin (H&E) histology slides are generated from all EMB events as part of standard-of-care. In published and patented prior efforts, we have extracted quantitative morphologic features from digitized H&E slides which, when modeled, demonstrate excellent performance for diagnosing myocardial injury and CAR grades. In Aim 2, we will move beyond standard H&E, leveraging our experience with quantitative, in-situ immune-profiling of transplant EMBs to develop a ‘morpho-molecular’ model for predicting future CAR. This aim will expand upon exciting pilot work which showed the CAR risk-stratification potential of combining quantitative image-analysis with multiplex immunofluorescence. Finally, in Aim 3, we will develop a ‘histo-informatics’ model for predicting CAR by integrating data from Aims 1 & 2 with comprehensive clinical informatics data extracted from the EHR. Ultimately, as a result of this work, we expect to validate a novel pre- cision prediction model for use in prospective investigations exploring personalized CAR surveillance and pre- vention strategies. Beyond the potential translational impact, this research plan will build on the Applicant’s knowledge of complex cohort design, integrated data modeling, and transplant immunodiagnostics. Along with planned coursework and a diverse mentoring, advisory, and collaborative team, this proposal provides the opti- mal vehicle for Dr. Peyster’s maturation into an investigator with proven expertise in multi-modality diagnostics. Project Narrative: There is considerable uniformity in the rejection surveillance and prevention protocols used in heart transplant medicine, primarily due to a lack of precision diagnostic tools for assessing individual rejection risk. The inability to provide personalized immunosuppression and biopsy schedules that are tailored to individual risk exposes patients to serious and avoidable opportunistic infections, procedural injuries, and rejection events. This proposal aims to apply advanced informatics, computer-vision, and in-situ diagnostic methods to archived clinical data and biopsy tissues in order to develop a rejection risk-prediction model

"Vanderbilt Integrated Center of Excellence in Maternal and Pediatric Precision Therapeutics (VICE-MPRINT) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT - OVERALL There is a rapidly expanding knowledge base enabling precision therapeutics for a number of human diseases, but there are significant unmet needs in evidence generation to support translation to the treatment of children and pregnant/post-partum women. The recent widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) and the linkage of these data to other large datasets represents an unprecedented opportunity for clinical research and discovery. The goals of this Center of Excellence in Maternal and Pediatric Precision Therapeutics are: to address key knowledge gaps and perform clinical research in pharmacogenomics and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome; to leverage data science methodologies and develop novel tools that support maternal and pediatric precision therapeutics research; and to enhance training for maternal and pediatric precision therapeutics at the local, regional, and national levels. We bring to this effort a unique collection of investigators, institutional support, tools, and resources that enable a paradigm-shift from current norms of slow, incremental progress. Project 1 will: use a community engaged approach to illuminate knowledge of, attitudes about, and priorities for pharmacogenomics; validate pharmacogenomic associations for maternal and pediatric populations using the innovative and generalizable strategy of EHR phenotyping; and identify and quantify variants with unknown functional consequence in diverse individuals to inform future research efforts and reduce disparities. Project 2 will: develop and validate EHR-based algorithms to identify a cohort of opioid- exposed infants and their mothers (dyads) and create a novel linkage of these data to state-wide data; test the hypothesis that use of medications for opioid use disorder is associated with improved early outcomes; and test the hypothesis that opioid use disorder treatment is associated with improvements in the novel longitudinal outcome of dyadic stability. These projects are led by multidisciplinary teams that include Investigators in Pediatrics and Obstetrics, and who are nationally recognized leaders in their respective fields. Both Projects will be supported by a Scientific Core – the Phenotyping Support Core - which enhances each project with expert phenotyping, machine learning/artificial intelligence, and experience in generalizing and disseminating phenotyping approaches. An Administrative Core will provide logistical support for the Center, supervise training opportunities, and ensure scientific interchange within the CET and with the MPRINT Hub. This work will contribute to innovative approaches to precision therapeutics for mothers and children and will develop the educational infrastructure to support the training of physician-scientists to support further advances well into the future. NARRATIVE - OVERALL The goal of precision therapeutics is to give the right dose of the right drug to the right person at the right time, but rigorous data on precision therapeutics in children and pregnant women are lacking, and there is a shortage of adequately trained investigators in these areas. This Center of Excellence proposal leverages our institutional strengths in Precision Medicine and Bioinformatics to address knowledge gaps in pharmacogenomics and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome using innovative analyses of electronic health datasets. Another major goal is the establishment and dissemination of educational resources to create and sustain a physician-scientist workforce in maternal and pediatric precision therapeutics at the national level through collaboration with the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.",Vanderbilt Integrated Center of Excellence in Maternal and Pediatric Precision Therapeutics (VICE-MPRINT),10309015,P50HD106446,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Attitude ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Handicapped ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' disabled ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled people ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' Health ', ' Infant ', ' Lactation ', ' lactating ', ' lactational ', ' Leadership ', ' Methodology ', ' Mothers ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome ', ' Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome ', ' Neonatal Substance Withdrawal ', ' Neonatal Withdrawal Syndrome ', ' newborn abstinence syndrome ', ' Discipline of obstetrics ', ' Obstetrics ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Pharmacogenetics ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Postpartum Women ', ' Post-partum Women ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' expectant mother ', ' expecting mother ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Training Support ', ' Translations ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' Postpartum ', ' post-partum ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Data Linkages ', ' Record Linkage Study ', ' Fostering ', ' Opioid ', ' Opiates ', ' Logistics ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic Human Experimentation ', ' Therapeutic Research ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' Pharmacogenomics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' NICHD ', "" National Institute of Children's Health and Human Development "", ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' Research Training ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Collection ', ' investigator training ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' biomed informatics ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' human disease ', ' implementation science ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' pregnant ', ' clinical care ', ' data sharing ', ' prescription opioid ', ' licit opioid ', ' opiate medication ', ' opioid medication ', ' prescribed opiate ', ' prescribed opioid ', ' prescription opiate ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' Precision therapeutics ', ' precision therapies ', ' precision treatment ', ' clinically actionable ', ' support tools ', ' training opportunity ', ' Data Science ', ' opioid use disorder ', ' opiate use disorder ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' Pharmacology Study ', ' Pharmacological Study ', ' healthy pregnancy ', ' opioid exposure ', ' opiate exposed ', ' opiate exposure ', ' opioid exposed ', ' Infrastructure ', ' education resources ', ' educational resources ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' ']",NICHD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,P50,2021,1250000,TN-05
"DS-I Africa - LAW Project Summary/Abstract The proposed project will have a strong focus on the legal dimensions of using data science for health discovery and innovation in Africa. Accordingly, the proposed project is intended to complement other ELSI projects that may focus more on the ethical and social implications. Without knowledge of the law, scientists risk starting a health research project only to later find the data that they have generated cannot be used as planned; without knowledge of the law, scientists risk wasting resources, legal liability, and even criminal sanctions. Accordingly, scientists need clarity regarding the `hard' law that governs the use of data in health research. The law can often be multi- layered, complex, and may differ between jurisdictions. Therefore, to facilitate health discovery and innovation that uses data science, legal clarity will be provided on a variety of critical legal themes, listed below. The expected output of the proposed project will be practical guides for scientists on how to be legally compliant with regard to each of these themes. The impact will be that scientists who plan projects using data science for health discovery and innovation in Africa (or with African collaborators) will be empowered to take the required actions to be legally compliant. The proposed project will have a broad jurisdictional scope, involving the law of twelve African nations. Five critical legal themes will be investigated over a three-year period: (1) modes of informed consent to the use of data; (2) the nature and content of individual and community rights in genomic data; (3) the use of persons' geospatial data for public health surveillance; (4) the cross-border sharing of data; and (5) the use of data as basis for Artificial Intelligence (AI). An important cross-cutting theme and goal of the proposed project is the decolonization and Africanization of extant law related to the use of data in health research. The proposed project will critically engage with the extant law of the twelve jurisdictions from the perspective of current trends in African legal philosophy. The expected outcomes are recommendations for legal innovation and inter- jurisdiction harmonization. The impact of these recommendations will be to empower policymakers in Africa to make the relevant law more attuned to the needs and expectations of the people of Africa. The project team consist of leading law academics from different regions in Africa – boasting with a collective publication record of 148 articles in peer-reviewed journals. The team's core expertise is the legal regulation of data, and African legal philosophy. Accordingly, the team is perfectly positioned to successfully execute the proposed project. Project Narrative The proposed project focuses on the legal dimensions of using data science for health discovery and innovation in Africa, and is intended to complement other ELSI projects that may focus more on the ethical and social implications. The proposed project will provide legal clarity and practical guidance on issues that are critical for scientists, and make recommendations for legal innovation and inter-jurisdiction harmonization through the lens of decolonization and Africanization.

"Bridging Gaps in the ELSI of Data Science Health Research in Nigeria (BridgELSI) Bridging Gaps in the ELSI of Data Science Health Research in Nigeria (BridgELSI) Project Summary Data science is poised to impact scientific research, innovation, discovery and healthcare in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) because of the rapid growth of infrastructure such as cell phones and computers, and the availability of technologies like Artificial Intelligence. These methods and resources present huge opportunities to leapfrog current research, public health and clinical care in Africa by utilizing data science to address the huge burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases in SSA. Despite these promises however, there are substantial concerns about the ethical, legal and social implications (ELSI) of data science research in SSA. These concerns arise from the use of conventional and unconventional data; the methods for generating, manipulating, storing, sharing and utilizing data in data science; the limitations of current informed consent models in these scenarios and opportunities for novel strategies for legal oversight of the ELSI of data science research in Nigeria. In this collaborative project between the Center for Bioethics and Research (CBR), Nigeria, George Washington University, DC and University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM), we will evaluate current legal instruments, guidelines and frameworks, and their implementation, and use these to develop new and innovative governance frameworks to support data science health research in Nigeria. We will also implement mixed research methods to prospectively evaluate the knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) of data scientists and ethics committees to current and emerging ELSI of data science research in Nigeria. Given the novelty of data science in Nigeria, we will implement general and specific, short and medium-term training in ethics of data science research in Nigeria for data science researchers and an introduction to data science for members of ethics committees reviewing data science research projects.

"Predicting epilepsy in cerebral malaria: working toward identifying biomarkers of epileptogenesis in children PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Over half a million children suffer from cerebral malaria annually, with up to 10-16% of this population developing epilepsy within two years. Thus, cerebral malaria contributes significantly to the global epilepsy burden. As in many acquired epilepsies, there remains an important gap in knowledge on how to identify which children after cerebral malaria infection will be at risk for epilepsy development. Identification of biomarkers heralding epilepsy risk would improve timely identification of who would most benefit from closer clinical monitoring- a critical consideration for improved allocation of the limited available resources in regions where this disease is most prevalent. Identification of the specific clinical and electroencephalographic (EEG) metrics which confer risk of post- malaria epilepsy will also importantly help understand epilepsy development in this disease. Studying these processes in acquired epilepsies has proven difficult to date due to the varied nature of etiologies and timing of epilepsy development after brain insult. Cerebral malaria has potential to be a unique model for identification of epileptogenesis biomarkers, as it is a single disease state with a high rate of post-epilepsy development within a relatively short time frame. This proposal will address key gaps in knowledge regarding the utility of clinical and EEG metrics readily available in resource-limited settings for predictive ability to prognosticate epilepsy risk in children with cerebral malaria. The findings have the potential to lay the foundation for future research of targeted interventions directed toward reducing post-cerebral malaria epilepsy development. This Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award application aligns with two of the benchmarks set by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and American Epilepsy Society, including Area II- understanding epileptogenesis, and Area III- identify biomarkers. This proposal is also designed to provide important opportunities for the training and career development of the candidate. Dr. Patel has experience in global neurology research and clinical neurophysiology; this award will allow her to gain further experience in clinical research methodology and specific training in computational analysis of EEG. These skills will lay a foundation for further study of this condition and potentially in anti-epileptogenesis trials of the post-cerebral malaria epilepsy model. Ultimately, this research proposal and the accompanying training will provide a strong foundation for a successful independent research career devoted to the understanding of epileptogenesis and reducing the risk of acquired epilepsies in children globally. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cerebral malaria continues to impact over half a million children annually, with 10-16% developing epilepsy within 2 years, and as such is a large contributor to the global epilepsy burden worldwide. This proposal will use cerebral malaria as model of acquired epilepsy, studying the ability of acute and recovery phase quantitative EEG measures in combination with clinical metrics in prediction of post- cerebral malaria epilepsy development. The findings of this study will inform the ability to appropriately allocate resources for children with cerebral malaria, lay the foundation for potential anti-epileptogenesis trials, and provide further understanding of acquired epilepsies as a whole for future study.",Predicting epilepsy in cerebral malaria: working toward identifying biomarkers of epileptogenesis in children,10302080,K23NS118051,"['Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Asphyxia Neonatorum ', ' birth asphyxia ', ' neonatal asphyxia ', ' perinatal asphyxia ', ' post-natal asphyxia ', ' postnatal asphyxia ', ' Award ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Coma ', ' Comatose ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Fever ', ' Pyrexia ', ' febrile ', ' febris ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hypoglycemia ', ' hypoglycemic ', ' hypoglycemic episodes ', ' Infection ', ' Malaria ', ' Paludism ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Cerebral Malaria ', ' Mentors ', ' Neurology ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Parasites ', ' Patients ', ' Publishing ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Seizures ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Zambia ', ' Northern Rhodesia ', ' Measures ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Survivors ', ' Training ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' neurological dysfunction ', ' Neurologic Dysfunctions ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' International ', ' Motor ', ' Predictive Value ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' Targeted Research ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' preclinical study ', ' pre-clinical study ', ' National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ', ' NINDS ', ' National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Epileptogenesis ', ' Outcome ', ' Antiepileptogenic ', ' Anti-epileptogenic ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' motor impairment ', ' movement impairment ', ' movement limitation ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' clinical risk ', ' training opportunity ', ' potential biomarker ', ' potential biological marker ', ' biomarker identification ', ' marker identification ', ' malaria infection ', ' malaria-infected ', ' malarial infection ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' childhood epilepsy ', ' pediatric epilepsy ', ' acquired epilepsy ', ' ']",NINDS,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2021,195955,MA-07
"fMRI physiological signatures of aging and Alzheimer's Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The growing availability of large functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets has enabled new investigations into functional systems of the human brain. A challenge – but also opportunity – of fMRI arises from the fact that BOLD signal stems from multiple intertwined neural and physiological sources. One major contributor to fMRI signals arises from slow (<0.15 Hz) fluctuations in respiration volume (RV) and heart rate (HR); these systemic physiological fluctuations can account for a substantial proportion of fMRI signals across gray matter, and exhibit spatial patterns that overlap with functional networks. While often treated as a confound, the components of fMRI data linked with systemic physiology may itself present useful information about brain function and physiology, enabling novel investigation of brain vasculature, autonomic function, and brain-body interactions. However, many existing fMRI datasets lack concurrent physiological recordings, and current data-driven techniques do not unambiguously resolve low-frequency physiological signal sources without peripheral cardiac and respiratory recordings for reference. This proposal conducts novel analyses to establish associations between fMRI physiological responses, brain networks, and neurocognitive function. Further, new techniques are proposed for extracting RV and HR time series directly from fMRI data, thereby enriching existing fMRI datasets with missing physiological information. Through analysis of large, public datasets, we will: 1) optimize and validate a deep learning technique for reconstructing physiological time series from resting-state fMRI data alone, which generalizes to participants across the adult lifespan; and 2) relate brain-wide fMRI physiological features to age and phenotypic variation; and 3) probe the value of fMRI physiological responses as early markers of Alzheimer's Disease. We will make all of the resulting signals, models, and code readily available to the community, so that researchers can apply and extend our methods to enhance the value of many existing datasets. Through approaches for resolving neural and physiological sources underlying fMRI signal dynamics, this project also has implications for increasing the precision of fMRI for mapping brain circuits at the level of the individual. PROJECT NARRATIVE Results of this study are expected to increase understanding of brain networks and physiology in aging, and could produce novel fMRI indicators of age-related changes in brain function. Our proposed methods for reconstruct low-frequency respiratory and cardiac fluctuations from fMRI data would also increase the scientific value of existing datasets, enabling analyses of brain-body interactions in the many datasets that lack physiological recordings.",fMRI physiological signatures of aging and Alzheimer's Disease,10361105,RF1MH125931,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Mapping ', ' Brain Stem ', ' Brainstem ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cerebrovascular Circulation ', ' brain blood flow ', ' cerebral blood flow ', ' cerebral circulation ', ' cerebrocirculation ', ' cerebrovascular blood flow ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emotions ', ' Exhibits ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Health ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Pulse Oximetry ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Respiration ', ' respiratory mechanism ', ' Rest ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Peripheral ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Cerebrovascular system ', ' brain blood vessels ', ' brain vasculature ', ' cerebral blood vessel ', ' cerebral vasculature ', ' cerebrovascular vessels ', ' cerebrovasculature ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Measurement ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' brain-body interaction ', ' mind body interaction ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' respiratory ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' age difference ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' cerebrovascular ', ' cerebral vascular ', ' cerebro-vascular ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' pathological aging ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Coupling ', ' Alzheimer disease detection ', ' AD detection ', "" Alzheimer's detection "", ' stem ', ' functional gain ', ' heart rate variability ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' STEM research ', ' science, technology, engineering and math research ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics research ', ' deep learning ', ' denoising ', ' de-noising ', ' ']",NIMH,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,RF1,2021,1055589,TN-05

While treatment of wet AMD with Intraocular injections can be effective in maintaining vision, such treatments are costly and may be associated with significant cardiovascular risks, or even progression of dry AMD. Hence, it is critical to identify patients at the earlier stages. Unfortunately, there is no effective, automated screening tool to accomplish this, and the patients themselves may be asymptomatic. The goal of this SBIR Direct-to-Phase II proposal is to provide such tool. We have demonstrated the feasibility of AMD screening software ‘iPredictTM’ by successfully identifying 98.1% of individuals with early or intermediate stage AMD. iPredictTM also successfully predicted which individuals would develop late AMD within one year with 87.8% accuracy and two years with 88.4% accuracy. iPredictTM has prototype components for image analysis and machine learning. We also developed a HIPAA compliant telemedicine platform which will enable iPredictTM to perform large-scale screening from remote and rural areas. In order to bring the product to market, these components need to be integrated and tested which is the aim of our proposed Direct-to-Phase II proposal. We aim to develop the finished product which will be ready for the market. We also aim to evaluate the efficacy of iPredictTM in a clinical setup. The AMD preventative market is estimated around $5.4 billion in the U.S. alone. iPredictTM will capture the major market share with its best accuracy and be the first prediction tool for AMD. We aim to commercialize iPredictTM for the screening and prevention of AMD, saving millions of citizens from blindness and reduced quality of life. With iPredictTM’s improvements in speed of delivery, cost of care, and ease of access, the product will be a significant addition to the healthcare system. The iPredictTM’s telemedicine platform will allow large-scale screening from remote/rural areas, primary care clinics, optometry offices and ophthalmology clinics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in its late forms, “dry” or “wet”, is the leading cause of blindness in developed countries. Early intervention and therapy can significantly reduce the progression of early to late AMD. Hence, the identification of patients with early AMD and referral to an ophthalmologist is critically needed to help prevent vision loss. To achieve this goal, we propose to develop an automated screening and prediction system that can be widely deployed to identify these individuals at risk of vision loss.",A Model for Predicting 2-Year Risk of Incident Late Age-related Macular Degeneration,10320271,R44EY031202,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Antioxidants ', ' anti-oxidant ', ' Color ', ' Counseling ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Ear ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye diseases ', ' eye disorder ', ' ophthalmopathy ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Fees ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Incentives ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Minerals ', ' New York ', ' Ophthalmology ', ' Optometry ', ' Optometries ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Retina ', ' Retinal Degeneration ', ' degenerative retina diseases ', ' retina degeneration ', ' retinal degenerative ', ' retinal degenerative diseases ', ' Retinal Diseases ', ' Retinal Disorder ', ' retina disease ', ' retina disorder ', ' retinopathy ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sales ', ' Savings ', ' Smoking ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual Acuity ', ' Vitamins ', ' Specialist ', ' Treatment Cost ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Telemedicine ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' rural location ', ' rural region ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Java ', ' Pythons ', ' Evaluation ', ' prognostic ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Age related macular degeneration ', ' Age-Related Maculopathy ', ' age related macular dystrophy ', ' senile macular disease ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Ophthalmologist ', ' Nonexudative age-related macular degeneration ', ' Atrophic AMD ', ' Atrophic age-related macular degeneration ', ' Dry AMD ', ' Non-exudative age-related macular degeneration ', ' dry age-related macular degeneration ', ' Trademark ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' developed country ', ' developed nation ', ' developed nations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Side ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' Visit ', ' Clinics or Hospitals ', ' Clinics and Hospitals ', ' American ', ' success ', ' Check-up ', ' checkup ', ' checkup examination ', ' HIPAA ', ' Kennedy Kassebaum Act ', ' PL 104-191 ', ' PL104-191 ', ' Public Law 104-191 ', ' United States Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ', ' Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ', ' Speed ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Categories ', ' Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Druse ', ' Drusen ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' solar exposure ', ' sun light exposure ', ' sunlight exposure ', ' Sun Exposure ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Supplementation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Validation ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' efficacy evaluation ', ' efficacy analysis ', ' efficacy assessment ', ' efficacy examination ', ' evaluate efficacy ', ' examine efficacy ', ' prospective ', ' user-friendly ', ' commercial application ', ' prototype ', ' photobiomodulation ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' screening ', ' Learning Module ', ' Education Module ', ' Educational Module ', ' Teaching Module ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' software as a service ', ' care costs ', ' Injections ', ' retinal imaging ', ' retina imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' sociodemographic factors ', ' socio-demographic factors ', ' remote screening ', ' ']",NEI,"IHEALTHSCREEN, INC.",R44,2021,45000,NY-05
"Optical design and the development of high accuracy automated tick classification using computer vision Abstract. The incidence of US tick-borne diseases has more than doubled in the last two decades. Due to lack of effective vaccines for tick-borne diseases, prevention of tick bites remains the primary focus of disease mitigation. Tick vector surveillance—monitoring an area to understand tick species composition, abundance, and spatial distribution—is key to providing the public with accurate and up-to-date information when they are in areas of high risk, and enabling precision vector control when necessary. Despite the importance of vector surveillance, current practices are highly resource intensive and require significant labor and time to collect and identify vector specimens. Acarologist or field taxonomist expertise is a limited resource required for tick identification, creating a significant capability barrier for national tick surveillance practice. While mobile applications to facilitate passive surveillance and reporting of human-tick encounters have grown in popularity, variable image quality, limited engagement, and scientist misidentification of rare, invasive, or morphologically similar tick species hinder the scalability of this approach. No automated solutions exist to build tick identification capacity. We seek to develop the first imaging and automated identification system capable of instantaneously and accurately identifying the top nine tick vectors in the US. This proposal will first characterize the optical requirements necessary to image diagnostic morphological features associated with adult ticks and develop a standardized imaging platform for tick identification. This will enable the development of a high-quality tick image dataset in partnership with the Walter Reed Biosystems Unit (WRBU) which will be used to train high-accuracy computer vision models for tick species and sex identification. Ultimately the approaches developed here will enable new tick identification tools for both the lab and citizen scientists; allowing vector surveillance managers to leverage image recognition in a practical system that will increase capacity and capability for biosurveillance, and equipping citizen scientists with improved tools to identify tick species during a human-tick encounter. Project Narrative. Despite the importance of tick vector surveillance for disease prevention, current practices to collect and identify specimens are resource intensive, limiting the quality and quantity of the data informing control efforts. Here we propose the determination of optical requirements for visualization of diagnostic features of the top nine US tick vectors, and the development of high-accuracy computer vision algorithms for the identification of tick species and sex for use in a standardized optical configuration. The high-accuracy tick classification system developed through this proposal promises to expand capacity and capability for tick vector surveillance.",Optical design and the development of high accuracy automated tick classification using computer vision,10325667,R43AI162425,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Diagnostic Imaging ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease Vectors ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Insecta ', ' Insects ', ' Insects Invertebrates ', ' Larva ', ' Learning ', ' Lighting ', ' Illumination ', ' Methods ', ' Culicidae ', ' Mosquitoes ', ' Nymph ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Spatial Distribution ', ' Standardization ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Ticks ', ' Ixodida ', ' Time ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' Vaccines ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Tick-Borne Diseases ', ' tick-borne illness ', ' tickborne disease ', ' tickborne illness ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Collaborations ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' novel ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' Agreement ', ' validation studies ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' Leg ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Surveillance Methods ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' vector control ', ' vector ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' human disease ', ' high risk ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Algorithm Design ', ' Algorithmic Design ', ' Algorithmic Engineering ', ' algorithm engineering ', ' algorithmic composition ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile device application ', ' imaging platform ', ' imaging system ', ' citizen science ', ' amateur science ', ' amateur scientists ', ' citizen scientists ', ' civic science ', ' crowd science ', ' crowd-sourced science ', ' scientific citizenship ', ' high resolution imaging ', ' Disease Surveillance ', ' Grain ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' vector tick ', ' Visualization ', ' tick bite ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' detection method ', ' detection procedure ', ' detection technique ', ' ']",NIAID,"VECTECH, LLC",R43,2021,295705,MD-07
"Understanding and Predicting Loss to Follow-up from Multi-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis Treatment in the Setting of High-HIV Burden Project Summary Globally, Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the leading infectious causes of death and a particular concern in countries with a high HIV burden. With only 57% of cases being successfully treated, multi-drug resistant-TB (MDR-TB) has become a substantial barrier to TB control. High rates of loss to follow up (LTFU) (i.e., missing two or more consecutive months of treatment) are a major contributor to the low MDR-TB treatment success rates. LTFU may lead to additional antibiotic resistance, MDR-TB treatment failure, and death. The World Health Organization recommends that patients at-risk for LTFU be given priority attention, but there is currently no evidence-based way to identify these patients. In order to address this gap, the proposed study will develop a prediction model for LTFU from MDR-TB treatment based on characteristics present at treatment initiation. If accurate, this model will identify the patients who are at high-risk for LTFU and who will draw the greatest benefit from interventions that promote care engagement and retention. Although the reasons for LTFU are complex, past research has yielded a number of potential predictors that will inform the proposed prediction model, including male sex, age, housing instability, alcohol use, substance use, employment status, education level, rural residence, and prior episode(s) of TB. In addition to factors present at treatment initiation, the relationship between LTFU and factors that change throughout treatment, including adverse treatment events and treatment regimen, will be examined to develop a broader understanding of MDR-TB care engagement. The proposed study will be nested within the control arm of a cluster-randomized trial of MDR-TB patients in South Africa (R01 AI104488). The specific aims of the proposed study, titled “Understanding and Predicting Loss to Follow-up from MDR-TB Treatment in the Setting of High-HIV Burden”, are to conduct a nested, retrospective cohort study among patients who were LTFU or successfully completed MDR-TB treatment (i.e., cured or completed treatment) to: (1a) develop a prediction model for LTFU from MDR-TB care based on the patient characteristics available at treatment initiation utilizing LASSO regression and k-fold cross-validation; (1b) adapt the prediction model developed in Aim 1a into a tool that can be used by providers at the point of care to estimate a patient’s risk for LTFU; (1c) determine if type of treatment regimen is a risk factor for LTFU and if it improves the fit of the prediction model developed in Aim 1a; and (2) examine the relationship between LTFU and the timing and burden of adverse treatment effects. This study will be the first to take a predictive modeling approach to guide MDR-TB providers in identifying patients at high-risk for LTFU and prioritizing their receipt of support services in order to ultimately improve MDR-TB treatment outcomes in resource-limited settings. Through the proposed study and training plan, the applicant will gain experience analyzing large, complex longitudinal data and applying machine learning to optimize patient engagement and clinical care. Narrative The World Health Organization estimates that 16% of all multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients are lost to follow up (LTFU), placing them at increased risk for treatment failure, death, and the development of additional resistance to antituberculosis medications. Despite mounting knowledge about the risk factors for LTFU from MDR-TB treatment and the End TB Strategy directive that patients at-risk for suboptimal treatment success be given priority attention, there is currently no evidence-based method that allows for the early identification of patients at-risk for being lost from care. The proposed study will use a nested retrospective cohort design to develop a model for predicting LTFU from MDR-TB treatment that can ultimately be used to guide MDR-TB providers in identifying patients at high-risk for LTFU and prioritizing their receipt of support services that promote care engagement and retention.",Understanding and Predicting Loss to Follow-up from Multi-Drug Resistant

"Automated system for risk determinantion, facilitation and community support to mitigate social determinants of health in minority populations Abstract Vulnerable and underserved populations such as ethnic and racial minorities, the poor, the LGBTQ community and those with physical or intellectual disabilities, often suffer the greatest health risks while facing significant barriers to receiving healthcare. While biological and clinical risks influence outcomes, sociocultural and socioeconomic factors also create major barriers to receiving healthcare services, at an individual, community and population level for these populations. These social determinants of health (SDOH), such as transportation, literacy, and finances can severely limit participation in health programs designed for the general population. Diabetes Prevention Programs are a good example of a lifestyle change protocol that is proven to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes by half for pre-diabetics patients at risk by encouraging weight-loss. But, despite the effectiveness of the program, more than 50% of participants drop out before completing this year-long lifestyle change program, severely limiting the program’s success. This is in part due to the fact that programs like DPP take little account of the limitations faced by underserved and vulnerable populations that it is meant to help. This lack of support at the individual and community level combined with the fact that healthcare institutions are not designed for, nor economical, in supporting patient health outside the medical facility where it is most needed. This creates a gap in healthcare service that current systems cannot overcome. Viora is closing this health services gap with a system that interfaces between the health care system, the underserved patient, and underutilized community-based resources and providers, to facilitate better outcomes in programs like DPP. By using risk stratification based on SDOH factors, each DPP participant can have tailored interventions that consider their socioeconomic and sociocultural characteristics. The Viora Health system connects patients to local resources using simple communication between the patient, health providers, and community services, facilitating patient completion of the DPP program, thereby improving health outcomes. In Phase I, Viora will evaluate a larger set of pre-diabetes and SDOH risk factors across 5000 minority and underserved subjects to select the most relevant variables for risk assessment and personal prevention plan development. The system will automatically screen pre-diabetic participants who are eligible, ready and able to adhere to DPP, and will create a personalized intervention plan that is the most impactful in reducing their risk but is also doable. The system’s communication network will be expanded to provide direct communication between the patient, DPP coach, health providers and community resources, to support the participant toward maintaining their DPP goals. Finally, the project will assess the basic function of the system, preferences and human interaction in a human subject study with underserved subjects and community-based partners. Completion of Phase I will demonstrate feasibility of our software system incorporating major components of the VIORA SYSTEM, which will inform the development of a minimum viable product to be tested in Phase 2. Narrative Vulnerable and underserved populations often suffer the greatest health risks while facing significant barriers, largely due to social and behavioral factors that hinder continued participation in disease prevention and management protocols. Viora Health’s system will have significant public health impact in scaling evidence- based protocols by using technology to identify such factors and leverage existing community based resources to support patients in mitigating these factors.","Automated system for risk determinantion, facilitation and community support to mitigate social determinants of health in minority

"Next generation axonal quantification and classification using AI Abstract This Lab to Marketplace project describes the development of HyperAxon™, highly innovative software for performing automated segmentation, tracing, reconstruction and quantitative analysis of all axonal fibers visible in three-dimensional (3D) microscopic images of central nervous system (CNS) areas, even those with extremely high axonal fiber density. Accurate and rigorous analysis of all axonal fibers visible in 3D microscopic images of CNS tissue of non-transgenic and transgenic animal models as well as in human post mortem CNS tissue holds the promise of novel insights into physiological neural network connectivity patterns as well as into the neuropathological underpinnings of alterations in connectivity associated with human neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders. However, this cannot be achieved with contemporary, computer-assisted tracing and reconstruction methods, which currently are the gold standard for investigating axonal fibers, because these methods primarily address tracing and reconstruction of only a limited number of individual axonal fibers. HyperAxon will be based on the highly innovative artificial intelligence technology Learning-based Tracing of Dense Axonal Fibers (LTDAF) that was recently developed at MIT Lincoln Laboratory (MIT LL) (Lexington, MA). This project will build upon the original, lab-built LTDAF technology to create commercial software for wide- spread dissemination of this important new technology. Dissemination of this technology via a Lab to Marketplace commercial product is consistent with NIMH goals and will result in the technology having a significant impact on neuroscience research. The game-changing innovation in HyperAxon is the ability to automatically (i) segment, trace and reconstruct all axonal fibers visible in 3D microscopic images of CNS areas with high axonal fiber density, (ii) identify axonal branch points, (iii) resolve axonal fibers of passage from axonal fibers that make presumptive synapses in target regions, (iv) identify axonal fibers showing acute axonal injury and (v) precisely quantify alterations in number and density of axonal fibers in CNS tissue. Based on published pilot work performed at MIT LL, we are convinced that HyperAxon will be impactful in the field of neuroscience research and will enable substantial advancements in research on alterations in CNS circuitry associated with neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric, neurodegenerative and neurological disorders. Ultimately, this will result in an improved basis for developing novel treatment strategies for a wide spectrum of complex brain diseases. In Phase I we will demonstrate feasibility of this novel technology by developing prototype software; work in Phase II will focus on creating the full functionality of HyperAxon for commercial release. We will perform extensive feasibility studies, product validation and usability studies of HyperAxon in close collaboration with MIT LL and our academic collaboration partners. A competing technology is not available.

"Optimizing population health outcomes in diabetic retinopathy through personalized and scalable screening strategies Project Summary / Abstract According to the National Eye Institute (NEI), early detection and timely treatment can reduce the risk of severe vision loss from diabetic retinopathy (DR) by 95%. Yet, DR remains the leading cause of blindness among American adults. By 2030, 54.9 million Americans are expected to have diabetes. The prevalence of vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy (VTDR) among people with diabetes is 4.4% and 10.2% in the US and worldwide, respectively, representing over 28 million people at risk of blindness. Because DR causes no pain, vision loss, or other symptoms at its early stages and only 50% of people with diabetes receive annual eye exams, many will be unaware of their disease until vision loss is irreversible. Retinal Care Inc. (RCI) believes that the root cause of this public health failure is more behavioral and educational than clinical; complete adherence to screening and treatment would prevent nearly all vision loss from DR. However, 100% adherence is not feasible, practical, or cost-effective. Eliminating blindness from DR requires a strategy shift that acknowledges that preventing vision loss from DR does not require a 100% annual screening rate; it requires only that all patients with VTDR are evaluated by an eye care provider and adhere to follow up recommendations. RCI's approach to cost-effectively eliminating blindness from DR is to prioritize patients who are most likely to require immediate attention and devote the resources necessary to ensure they are evaluated by an eye care provider. The proposed project is designed to accomplish this goal through VTDR risk prediction; targeted patient engagement, education, and behavioral interventions; and optimization of the full system to achieve maximum population benefit. In Aim 1, RCI will leverage our existing Data Repository and machine learning methods to predict VTDR risk using electronic health record (EHR) and healthcare insurance claims data, with the initial goal of correctly placing over 90% of patients with VTDR in the highest-risk half of the population when ordered by risk. In doing so, RCI can focus patient engagement resources on patients who are most likely to need immediate evaluation and treatment, rather than diverting resources to patients who are less likely to require immediate attention. In Aim 2, RCI will use mixed methods framed by the Integrated Behavior Model to identify barriers and motivators for screening and assess their relative importance, develop and implement a survey instrument to elicit willingness to participate in screening based on motivating factors and barrier removal, and use natural language processing to detect barriers and facilitators for diabetic eye screening from patient communications. In Aim 3, RCI will create an agent-based simulation tool to guide care coordination recommendations in a way that maximizes population health outcomes subject to constraints on time and cost. The tool will identify optimal intervention strategies and be adaptable to changes in cost, disease burden, patient preference, population characteristics, and other parameters. Decisions that will be optimized include resource allocation as a function of risk, intervention timing, screening modality, communication strategies, barrier removal strategies, and other modifiable aspects of the system. Project Narrative Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is expected to affect over 11 million people in the US by 2030 and is the leading cause of blindness in American adults, despite vision loss being almost entirely preventable with timely detection and treatment. To prevent blindness from DR, the Retinal Care-DR program is designed to eliminate the deficiencies of the current care delivery model by implementing a first-of-its-kind, personalized care coordination program guided by individual disease risk and population-level outcomes. This will be accomplished through the application of machine learning to prioritize patients for care coordination by disease risk, development of tools to identify and understand the impact of barriers and motivators for diabetic eye screening for high risk patients, and care coordination decision logic guided by agent-based simulation to maximize population health outcomes subject to financial constraints.",Optimizing population health outcomes in diabetic retinopathy through personalized and scalable screening strategies,10324935,R44EY033251,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult

"Interpretation Bias as a Mechanism of Treatment Response in OCD Project Summary Although exposure and response prevention (ERP) is well-established as the first line of treatment for obsessive- compulsive disorder (OCD), 40-50% of patients who receive this intervention do not recover. Novel augmentations are needed to more efficiently target the mechanisms that maintain OCD symptoms in this population. One candidate mechanism is interpretation bias, the misinterpretation of ambiguous stimuli as threatening, contributing to the development and maintenance of OCD. In the absence of interventions that more efficiently and effectively target interpretation bias, it will likely remain difficult to increase rates of treatment response and decrease relapse. The objective of this proposal is to test the feasibility, acceptability, adherence, target engagement, and clinical outcomes of an intervention targeting interpretation bias, with the ultimate goal of contributing to the development of novel, scalable, technology-driven augmentations to ERP. Improvements in interpretation bias have been associated with OC symptom reduction. Therefore, an accessible intervention which directly targets interpretation bias may be an ideal augmentation to improve clinical outcomes during ERP. Cognitive Bias Modification for Interpretation Bias (CBM-I), a computerized intervention, has shown reliable effects for engagement of interpretation. Studies of CBM-I in OCD have been largely conducted in analogue samples, and studies with clinical samples have been limited. This proposal will address the critical need of developing interventions to augment ERP by utilizing CBM-I, with primary aims to: 1) test whether CBM-I induces changes in interpretation bias in OCD and to determine if these changes are associated with clinical outcomes across multi-modal assessments, and 2) leverage advances in machine learning to develop personalized predictions of which individuals with OCD are best-suited for CBM-I. We hypothesize that a multivariate model incorporating pre-treatment clinical, behavioral and demographic characteristics will predict patient-specific probability of responding to CBM-I. These aims map onto the candidate’s training goals, with critical new training and mentorship provided in the areas of: 1) effectiveness trials methodology with an experimental therapeutics approach (Co-Primary Mentor Dr. Courtney Beard; Co-Mentor Dr. Sabine Wilhelm); 2) ecological momentary assessment (Co-Primary Mentors Dr. Christian Webb and Dr. Beard; Collaborator Dr. Justin Baker); 3) machine learning techniques (Dr. Webb and Collaborator Dr. Boyu Ren); and 4) career development (Co-Mentor Dr. Kerry Ressler). This K23 Award will support an innovative program of patient-oriented research and provide the candidate with the skills necessary to become an independent investigator focused on advancing the understanding, prediction, and treatment of non-response and relapse, to optimize outcomes of exposure therapy for refractory patients with OC-related disorders. Project Narrative Nearly half of patients do not recover following the first line of treatment for OCD, exposure and response prevention (ERP). This study proposes to test a novel method of augmenting ERP, a computerized, scalable intervention targeting interpretation bias, which is a critical mechanism underlying OCD. The overall goal is to contribute to the development of technology-driven augmentations to ERP to enhance response rates, which may generalize to treatment for other OC-related and anxiety disorders in the future.",Interpretation Bias as a Mechanism of Treatment Response in OCD,10368212,K23MH126193,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Award ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Psychiatric Hospitals ', ' Mental Hospitals ', ' Mental Institutions ', ' mental health facility ', ' Interviewer ', ' Learning ', ' Maintenance ', ' Maps ', ' Mental Processes ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder ', ' Obsessive-Compulsive Neurosis ', ' Patients ', ' Probability ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Refractory ', ' Training ', ' Obsession ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' analog ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Techniques ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' tech development ', ' technology development ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' treatment program ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' psychoeducation ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' patient oriented study ', ' patient oriented research ', ' Experimental Therapies ', ' Investigational Treatments ', ' experimental therapeutic agents ', ' experimental therapeutics ', ' Investigational Therapies ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' K23 Award ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Program ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Cognitive ', ' Preparation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Modification ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' computerized ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' improved outcome ', ' reduce symptoms ', ' alleviate symptom ', ' ameliorating symptom ', ' decrease symptom ', ' fewer symptoms ', ' relieves symptoms ', ' symptom alleviation ', ' symptom reduction ', ' symptom relief ', ' recruit ', ' personalized predictions ', ' Individualized Predictors ', ' individualized predictions ', ' personalized predictors ', ' kernel methods ', ' kernel learning ', ' multi-kernel learning ', ' treatment as prevention ', ' treatment-based prevention ', ' feasibility testing ', ' ']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,K23,2021,181480,MA-05
"I-SCREEN: Increasing Screening for Cancer using a Randomized Evaluation of EHR-based Nudges Project Summary Cancer remains a leading cause of mortality among older adults in the United States. However, despite established guidelines supporting appropriate cancer screening in order to prevent death and adverse cancer- related outcomes, screening is often underutilized. Barriers to appropriate screening are even greater for groups facing long-standing screening disparities, such as racial/ethnic minorities and individuals with low socioeconomic status (SES). Key drivers of screening underutilization are decision-making biases facing clinicians and patients, highlighting the need for scalable solutions that are designed to address these biases and tailored to overcome barriers facing high-risk patients.  Nudges, interventions designed using behavioral economic principles, improve behavior by addressing biases that lead to suboptimal decisions. Our team has extensive experience working with health systems to test and scale nudge interventions to overcome decision-making biases facing patients and/or clinicians. We have also demonstrated how these types of nudges can improve health care value and patient outcomes. Since electronic health records (EHRs) have been adopted by more than 90% of clinicians in the US, it is an ideal platform upon which to deploy large scale behavior change nudge interventions.  In this study, we propose to personalize nudge interventions to clinicians and patients, with a focus on how to tailor nudges to the needs of high-risk patients and how to implement promising nudges to improve cancer screening among older adults. We will pilot this work at Penn Medicine and then implement a pragmatic trial at sites in the Penn Medicine, University Hospitals, and Sutter Health systems.  In the R61 phase, we will complete the following aims at Penn Medicine: analyze EHR and claims data and identify characteristics and subgroups of patients at high-risk for not completing cancer screening (Aim 1), test the feasibility of individual nudge interventions within an EHR nudge toolkit (Aim 2), and pilot test nudge interventions to identify the most promising approaches to increase cancer screening rates for high-risk patients in each subgroup (Aim 3).  In the R33 phase, we will achieve the following aims at Penn Medicine, University Hospitals, and Sutter Health: conduct a two-arm pragmatic cluster-randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of personalized EHR-based nudges to clinicians and patients on increasing cancer screening rates (Aim 1), evaluate if EHR-based nudge interventions reduce disparities in cancer screening rates for racial/ethnic minorities and patients with low socioeconomic status (Aim 2), and inform future design of tailored EHR interventions by examining heterogeneity of treatment response with respect to clinician and patient characteristics (Aim 3). Project Narrative Despite established guidelines supporting appropriate cancer screening in order to prevent death and adverse cancer-related outcomes, screening is often underutilized. In this project, we will pilot nudge interventions among older adults – including racial/ethnic minorities, low SES individuals, and other high-risk groups identified using novel analytic methods – and tailor nudges to overcome screening barriers facing these patient groups. We will then conduct a pragmatic, multisite trial evaluating the ability for tailored nudges to clinicians and patients to improve vaccination rates and reduce disparities in care.",I-SCREEN: Increasing Screening for Cancer using a Randomized Evaluation of EHR-based Nudges,10238838,R61AG068947,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Behavior ', ' California ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Counseling ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' University Hospitals ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Medicine ', ' mortality ', ' Ohio ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' medication prescription ', ' prescribed medication ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Recommendation ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Vaccination ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Guidelines ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Individual ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' lung cancer ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' CRC screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' detect colo-rectal cancer ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' lung cancer screening ', ' lung cancer early detection ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' Clinic ', ' behavior change ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' heuristics ', ' novel ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' social ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' end-of-life ', ' end of life ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' mammary screening ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Characteristics ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' Information Technology ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' discounting ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer-related health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' ethnoracial ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' effective intervention ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' multi-site trial ', ' multisite trial ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' pragmatic effectiveness trial ', ' arm ', ' operation ', ' screening ', ' behavioral economics ', ' Data Science ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' disparate health care ', ' disparate healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' intervention cost ', ' preventable death ', ' preventable mortality ', ' screening disparities ', ' effectiveness testing ', ' feasibility testing ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R61,2021,294241,PA-03
"Estimating and Mitigating Thyroid Cancer Overdiagnosis: A Mathematical Modeling Approach Project Summary/Abstract This proposal will generate evidence to reduce the overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer in the United States. Overdiagnosis is the identification of a disease that, had it not been detected, would be unlikely to cause symptoms or death during a patient’s lifetime. Overdiagnosis has significant consequences, such as overtreatment with associated side effects and complications, patient anxiety, and increased healthcare costs. Despite a three-fold increase in thyroid cancer diagnoses since the late 1980s, the mortality rate remains stable. Small papillary thyroid cancers, which are rarely lethal, are responsible for virtually the entire increase in incidence. However, it is not safe to assume that all small thyroid cancers are overdiagnosed; some small thyroid cancers can be aggressive and do need treatment. Effective methods are urgently needed to understand the key factors contributing to thyroid cancer overdiagnosis, so that directed solutions can be developed and implemented to reduce overdiagnosis. We propose the innovative use of systems engineering and simulation modeling to address this knowledge gap and provide a nuanced understanding of the natural history of thyroid tumors. We will use our model to identify the effect of reducing referrals for and use of thyroid imaging on overdiagnosis; the effect of changing the size threshold for biopsy on overdiagnosis; and the downstream impact of reducing overdiagnosis on harms and benefits of treatment. This approach also accounts for differential use and improved precision of ultrasound over time. Our goal is to create and validate a simulation model that quantifies overdiagnosis in thyroid cancer. We will engage stakeholders at all stages of development, from model conception to validation, to elicit clinical guidance and inform our model inputs, outcomes, and dissemination strategies. Our research team comprises an industrial-systems engineer with expertise in cancer modeling, as well as experts in thyroid cancer, cancer epidemiology, health services research, and communication. The multidisciplinary team is highly qualified to complete the three specific aims: (1) Develop and validate a simulation model to quantify overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer in the US; (2) Identify healthcare utilization patterns (e.g., provider encounters and referral decisions) that expose patients to increased thyroid imaging, biopsies, and the overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer; (3) Engage key stakeholders throughout the duration of the project to ensure that the model has face validity, and that the output can be applied to questions important to both clinicians and policy makers.

"Transporting effects using a multicenter randomized study to different target populations PROJECT SUMMARY  Large confirmatory or pragmatic clinical trials enroll patients from multiple centers to obtain high-quality evidence useful for decision-making in diverse healthcare systems. The design of multicenter trials is particularly appealing to policymakers because many tend to be pragmatic and offer access to a large sample of diverse patient populations. Decision-makers trying to use the results of multicenter trials have specific target populations in mind. Yet, selection at both the center and individual participant level challenges the ability of even well-designed and conducted multicenter trials to draw inferences about any meaningful target population. These selection mechanisms, even in impeccably conducted multicenter trials, result in samples of trial participants that are not representative of any specific target population. When treatment effects are heterogeneous over covariates that are differentially distributed across centers, the overall trial average treatment effect estimate will not apply to any one of the populations underlying the participating centers or the target population. Consider for example, the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), a large multicenter trial of 33 centers (53,456 individuals) across the United States, which motivated this proposal. Because the positive benefits of screening are mainly concentrated in individuals at high-risk for lung cancer it is critical that individuals are appropriately targeted for screening recommendations. Our long-term objective is to optimize the applicability of trial results into clinical practice. We will take steps toward this objective by achieving the following specific aims: (1) Develop robust and efficient statistical methods, that can be combined with modern machine learning techniques, to reinterpret a multicenter trial in the context of each of the participating centers and to transport inferences from a multicenter trial to a new target population; (2) Evaluate the performance of methods developed in Aim 1 in simulation studies that reflect real-world data by considering scenarios with different sample sizes, number of centers, treatment effects, and outcome or selection mechanisms; (3) Apply the methods in the NLST to reinterpret the trial in the context of one of the participating centers and to transport trial findings to a new target population using baseline data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a nationally representative survey of the United States general population. The proposed work is innovative for analyzing multicenter trials because it develops new methods, clarifies the assumptions needed for obtaining valid inference, and empirically assesses method performance. This work is significant because as a result of applying these methods, policymakers will be able to learn about treatment effects in different underlying populations and produce high-quality evidence of interventions in diverse populations that are often unrepresented in trials. Insights gained from this work will improve the value of multicenter trials for decision-making. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will improve the value of multicenter trials for decision-making in diverse healthcare systems. Selection bias at both the individual and center level challenge the applicability of trial findings to populations often underrepresented in trials, such as women, ethnic/racial minorities, or the elderly. This work aligns with AHRQ’s mission and priority areas because as a result of applying these proposed methods, policymakers will be able to learn about treatment effects in different underlying target populations and produce high-quality evidence of interventions in diverse populations that are often unrepresented in trials, where decisions must be made.",Transporting effects using a multicenter randomized study to different target populations,10228266,R36HS028373,[''],AHRQ,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R36,2021,43083,RI-01
"Clinical glaucoma management enabled by visible-light OCT Project Summary This collaborative technology focused project seeks to develop, characterize, and validate visible-light optical coherence tomography (vis-OCT) as a functional tool to transform the clinical management of glaucoma. We will address two unmet needs in clinical glaucoma diagnosis and detection of progression: (1) the ability to measure retinal sublayer structure and (2) to accurately assess local retinal hemoglobin oxygen saturation (sO2). The earliest structural changes in glaucoma are thought to be a retraction of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) dendrites in the inner plexiform layer (IPL). Specifically, this would occur in the outer IPL, where RGC “off” cells synapse. Identification of loss of synapses, either by decreased scattering or by the change in IPL sublayers’ thicknesses, could serve as an earlier and more sensitive biomarker for glaucoma than any other. Measuring retinal sO2 and specific arteriole-venule couplets can determine the oxygen extraction in the regions served by those vessels. Our preliminary data indicate that regions showing damage in glaucomatous eyes have lower oxygen extraction than similar areas in healthy eyes. Our observation suggests that such oxygen extraction abnormalities can be measured well beyond the “floor effect” threshold noted with conventional OCT, allowing assessment of disease beyond the time point that conventional structural OCT becomes insensitive. To achieve our long-term goal, we will focus on new vis-OCT optical system design, imaging protocols, and data processing methodologies to identify both metabolic and ultra-fine anatomical alternations in early glaucoma, both of which are beyond the capabilities of existing imaging technologies. Project Narrative This proposal aims to develop a new clinical imaging modality, referred to as visible-light optical coherence tomography (vis-OCT), to improve the clinical care of glaucoma. The new vis-OCT clinical modality will offer the highest resolution and new functional imaging capabilities to grade the earliest glaucoma damages that are unable to be detected currently.",Clinical glaucoma management enabled by visible-light OCT,10279742,U01EY033001,"['Adoption ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Angiography ', ' Angiogram ', ' angiographic imaging ', ' arteriole ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bio-engineered ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bioengineering ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Blood capillaries ', ' capillary ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Color ', ' Dendrites ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Floor ', ' Foundations ', ' Glaucoma ', ' glaucomatous ', ' Goals ', ' Hemoglobin ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Motion ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Oxygen ', ' O element ', ' O2 element ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Retina ', ' Retinal Ganglion Cells ', ' retinal ganglion ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' venule ', ' Ultrafine ', ' Measures ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Caring ', ' Doppler Ultrasound ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' Ophthalmoscopes ', ' Funduscopes ', ' improved ', ' Anterior ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Visible Radiation ', ' Visible Light ', ' Visible Light Radiation ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Measurement ', ' Metabolic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Scientist ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Structure ', ' Modality ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Inner Plexiform Layer ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Management ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Imaging technology ', ' data acquisition ', ' neurotoxic ', ' ultra high resolution ', ' healthy volunteer ', ' clinical care ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' early detection biomarkers ', ' early biomarkers ', ' early detection markers ', ' clinically translatable ', ' clinical imaging ', ' metabolic imaging ', ' imaging capabilities ', ' retinal imaging ', ' retina imaging ', ' ']",NEI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,698124,IL-07

"Center for Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) PROJECT SUMMARY  Experimental determination of protein structure often provides atomic accuracy models, but is inherently time- consuming, often costly, and not always possible. Computational modeling is currently less accurate, but offers an alternative approach when experimental results are not available. The goal of CASP (Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction) is to advance the protein structure modeling field by conducting community-wide experiments that objectively determine the strengths and weaknesses of current methods and so foster progress. Approximately 100 research groups world-wide participate. In the most recent experiment (2018), there were 57,000 submissions in nine modeling categories, including over 35,000 tertiary structure models. The Center provides the infrastructure for CASP and Aim 1 is the continued development and operation of this resource. Principal tasks include registration and communication with participants; solicitation, characterization, and management of modeling targets; collection and validation of models; and extensive numerical analysis of submissions. These operations are supported by a secure and robust data infrastructure. The Center also develops evaluation, analysis, and display software, and provides access to models and evaluation results. CASP relies on independent assessors, experts in modeling or a related experimental field, to interpret the results. The Center coordinates this process, providing evaluation data and, when necessary, implementing new evaluation methods.  Recent CASPs have shown dramatic improvements in model accuracy, especially for the most difficult cases where homology modeling cannot be used. A major factor driving progress is the use of new machine learning approaches, particularly convolutional neural networks. These and related methods appear poised to make further major advances in a number of key modeling areas. The plan for the next period of the project is designed to capitalize on these and other opportunities for progress. Greater success with modeling small proteins and domains dictates a shift in emphasis to the still challenging area of large multi-domain proteins and complexes (Aim 2), where progress is expected both from the machine learning developments and from the incorporation of sparse experimental data. Although accuracy of models has improved, it is still seldom competitive with experiment. Aim 3 is to pursue strategies that will make models more accurate and useful, by nurturing further progress in refining initial models, better methods for estimating model accuracy, and assessment of the utility of models. Aim 4 introduces new ways of strengthening interactions between CASP and the broader research community, providing models that directly address contemporary problems (for example, for CoV-2 protein structures) and boosting communications through meetings, webinars, publications and other means. PROJECT NARRATIVE Knowledge of macromolecular structure plays a crucial role in biology and medicine, allowing for detailed studies and understanding of biological processes and disease mechanisms.

"Identifying treatment responders in medication trials for AUD using machine learning approaches ABSTRACT Alcohol use disorder (AUD), as defined in DSM-5, represents a highly prevalent, costly, and often untreated condition in the United States. Pharmacotherapy offers a promising avenue for treating AUD and for improving clinical outcomes for this debilitating disorder. While developing novel medications to treat AUD remains a high priority research area, there remain major opportunities to further elucidate clinical response in completed medication trials. To that end, a key question in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) is which patients respond to a given pharmacotherapy. Identifying treatment responders provides major opportunities to advance clinical care for AUD by personalizing medication practices on the bases of variables/predictors of good clinical response. For example, while the effect size for medications such as naltrexone is deemed small-to-moderate, a host of studies over the past decade have shown that its effect size may be considerably larger for certain subgroups of patients. Towards advancing precision medicine for AUD and leveraging data from a host of carefully conducted RCTs for AUD, this R03 application seeks to conduct secondary data analysis. Specifically, we propose to analyze data from four RCTs conducted by the NIAAA Clinical Investigations Group (NCIG). These state-of-the-art RCTs for AUD have tested the following pharmacotherapies: (a) quetiapine, (b) Levetiracetam XR (Keppra XR®), (c) Varenicline (Chantix®), and (d) HORIZANT® (Gabapentin Enacarbil) Extended-Release. In this R03 application, we propose to use a machine learning approach to identify treatment responders in the NCIG RCTs. Machine learning represents a highly promising and underutilized data analytic strategy in the field of AUD treatment response. Machine learning models prioritize the ability to predict future outcomes over creating perfectly fitting models for the data at hand. This results in models which are more generalizable to future observations, which fits well with our goal of identifying responders in RCTs. Leveraging data from these pivotal RCTs through secondary data analysis and using novel analytic methods, namely machine learning, provides a cost-effective approach to identifying AUD pharmacotherapy responders.

"Patient-Centered Serious Games for Remote Cognitive Training in Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment Project Summary/Abstract Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is characterized by cognitive decline greater than expected from normal aging, which does not yet significantly interfere with the performance of activities of daily living. The therapeutic goal for MCI is to slow down the course of the disease progress and reduce the impact of clinical symptoms. There has also been a particular emphasis on non-pharmacological interventions because they can slow disease progression and are low cost, non-invasive, safe, and have no adverse side effects. Serious games have received great interests among researchers and clinicians as a promising, low-cost, non- pharmacological intervention tool that can help assess and train patients’ cognitive function in a variety of environments (e.g., in/outside the clinic). Serious games in healthcare represent digital applications focusing on educating, informing, and enhancing patients’ health by leveraging the entertainment components of video games. However, currently available solutions require substantial involvement of trained caregivers and clinicians to motivate patients to adhere to the intervention protocol, which acts as the key barrier to the widespread implementations of serious game-based interventions. To bridge these gaps, this project aims to develop a mobile-health (mHealth) technology designed to encourage the use of, and thereby maximizing the compliance to, serious game-based training in individuals with MCI outside the clinic. We plan to employ a tablet-based application – namely Neuro-World – composed of six serious games designed to stimulate working memory and selective attention, which is developed by our research team’s industrial partner. Fully leveraging the system’s ability to provide clinically meaningful insights related to patients’ cognitive performance from their gameplays, their progress over time, and their compliance behaviors (e.g., use frequency and duration), it is our ultimate research goal to develop an optimal, human-centered serious game platform that can motivate patients’ to better adhere to the technological regimen. To accomplish this research goal, Aim 1 will focus on evaluating the preliminary efficacy of our serious games as a training tool to improve cognitive function. We will perform a small single-blind randomized controlled trial in 50 individuals with MCI who will be randomized either to the intervention group or the control group. In Aim 2, we will develop machine learning-based algorithms to derive clinically meaningful information regarding cognitive function from the game performance. Aim 3 will finally investigate the optimal design of the mHealth system to maximize patients’ compliance with serious game-based training via human-centered design approaches. We believe that outcomes of this project will open a new door leading to previously unexplored datasets and understanding of patient-technology interactions to promote positive behavior changes to enable self- administered, serious game-based cognitive training, which can form the basis of a wide range of future investigations of hemiparesis rehabilitation and personalized disease management. Project Narrative Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is characterized by cognitive decline greater than expected from normal aging. Serious games have received great interests from researchers and clinicians as a promising, low-cost, non- pharmacological intervention tool that can complement the conventional therapeutic programs to help assess and rehabilitate patients' functional impairments in many environments (e.g., clinics, long-term care facilities, patients' homes). In this project, we propose to develop a human-centered mobile-health (mHealth) technology designed to encourage the self-administrate serious game-based training in patients with MCI outside the clinic.",Patient-Centered Serious Games for Remote Cognitive Training in Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment,10190616,R21AG071988,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', ' Attention ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Control Groups ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' care facilities ', ' hemiparesis ', ' hemiparetic ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Industrialization ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' longterm care ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Persons ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Self Administration ', ' Self-Administered ', ' Tablets ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Time ', ' Video Games ', ' videogame ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' rural location ', ' rural region ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' selective attention ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Single-Blind Study ', ' Single-blind ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' Informatics ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' psychological distress ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' patient cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' treatment compliance ', ' compliance behavior ', ' Health system ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Caregiver instruction ', ' care giver education ', ' care giver instruction ', ' care giver training ', ' caregiver training ', ' caregiver education ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Cognitive ', ' cognitive training ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' chronic stroke ', ' usability ', ' normal aging ', ' prototype ', ' community setting ', ' group intervention ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' Regimen ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' cognitive performance ', ' clinical investigation ', ' personalized management ', ' individualized management ', ' individualized patient management ', ' personalized clinical management ', ' personalized disease management ', ' precision management ', ' stroke survivor ', ' translational impact ', ' recruit ', ' patient engagement ', ' participant engagement ', ' side effect ', ' underserved area ', ' under served area ', ' under served geographic area ', ' under served location ', ' under served region ', ' underserved geographic area ', ' underserved location ', ' underserved region ', ' clinical outcome measures ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R21,2021,436836,MA-02
"BECKON - Block Estimate Chain: creating Knowledge ON demand & protecting privacy 7. Project Summary/Abstract With the wide adoption of electronic health record systems, cross-institutional genomic medicine predictive modeling is becoming increasingly important, and have the potential to enable generalizable models to accelerate research and facilitate quality improvement initiatives. For example, understanding whether a particular variable has clinical significance depends on a variety of factors, one important one being statistically significant associations between the variant and clinical phenotypes. Multivariate models that predict predisposition to disease or outcomes after receiving certain therapeutic agents can help propel genomic medicine into mainstream clinical care. However, most existing privacy-preserving machine learning methods that have been used to build predictive models given clinical data are based on centralized architecture, which presents security and robustness vulnerabilities such as single-point-of-failure. In this proposal, we will develop novel methods for decentralized privacy-preserving genomic medicine predictive modeling, which can advance comparative effectiveness research, biomedical discovery, and patient-care. Our first aim is to develop a predictive modeling framework on private Blockchain networks. This aim relies on the Blockchain technology and consensus protocols, as well as the online and batch machine learning algorithms, to provide an open-source Blockchain-based privacy-preserving predictive modeling library for further Blockchain-related studies and applications. We will characterize settings in which Blockchain technology offers advances over current technologies. The second aim is to develop a Blockchain-based privacy-preserving genomic medicine modeling architecture for real-world clinical data research networks. These aims are devoted to the mission of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) to develop biomedical technologies with application domain of genomics and healthcare. The NIH Pathway to Independence Award provides a great opportunity for the applicant to complement his computer science background with biomedical knowledge, and specialized training in machine learning and knowledge-based systems. It will also allow him to investigate new techniques to advance genomic and healthcare privacy protection. The success of the proposed project will help his long-term career goal of obtaining a faculty position at a biomedical informatics program at a major US research university and conduct independently funded research in the field of decentralized privacy-preserving computation. 8. Project Narrative The proposed research will develop practical methods to support privacy-preserving genomic and healthcare predictive modeling, and build innovations based on Blockchain technology for secure and robust machine learning training processes. The development of such privacy technology may increase public trust in research and quality improvement.

"Development of a novel medication adherability tool to improve cardiovascular disease management Nearly half of patients with heart disease become non-adherent to their prescribed therapies within a year of treatment initiation. This is a central and modifiable reason why cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of death in the US. Despite numerous attempts to develop interventions aimed at improving adherence, these attempts have had varying and often limited success; one explanation could be that underlying barriers to adherence are not being addressed. Those interventions that have been successful often make medications easier to take but are frequently expensive to implement or deployed too late. Developing a novel provider- facing intervention that modifies medication “adherability”, defined as the properties of medications that make them difficult for patients to take, could be especially impactful and relatively inexpensive. For example, more than 30% of patients report difficulties swallowing prescribed medicines, yet little is known how this “adherability” affects long-term adherence and clinical outcomes, and few interventions focus on these issues.  To this end, Dr. Lauffenburger’s K01 proposal incorporates a novel prophylactic, patient-centric approach to provider behavior change for cardiovascular disease management. Providers often do not know what the medications they prescribe actually look like or what aspects of the medications are acceptable to or preferred by their patients. This study will uniquely incorporate patient perspectives about medication properties that lead to poor adherence in the design of a scalable provider-facing clinical decision support intervention.  The proposed aims are to: (1) develop a comprehensive framework of cardiovascular medication properties, such as appearance, side-effect profiles, or dosing, that may lead to poor adherence using patient focus groups; (2) rigorously evaluate their effects on adherence and clinical outcomes in large national data sources; (3) develop and externally validate a novel clinical prediction rule for medication adherability; and (4) develop and pilot test novel web- and electronic health record-based prescribing tools based on the prediction rule for providers. The expected overall impact of this innovative proposal is that it will fundamentally advance how to personalize medications for patients to ultimately improve adherence and health outcomes.  Dr. Lauffenburger has a unique background as a practicing pharmacist trained in epidemiology with a proven commitment to research. This proposal includes an educational plan that will address gaps in her training: expertise in behavioral sciences, prediction modeling, and implementation research. The mentorship team, led by Niteesh Choudhry, an expert in adherence and implementation, includes well-known experts in cardiovascular trials (Elliott Antman, co-mentor), biostatistics (Robert Glynn, co-mentor), and behavioral sciences (Daniel Solomon, co-mentor), and will ensure scientific success and training. By the conclusion of this program, she will be able to independently design, target, and evaluate behavioral interventions for heart diseases. The results of the proposed K01 will be invaluable pilot work for a planned R01-level application. We propose a novel strategy to address the epidemic of poor adherence to cardiovascular therapies: tailoring medications for vulnerable patients based on their “adherability”, or the properties of medication like dosing frequency, palatability, and side-effect profiles, that make them difficult to take regularly. To achieve the proposed research, we will conduct focus groups with at-risk patients, determine the effect of adherability on long-term adherence and cardiovascular outcomes, develop and validate a novel adherability clinical prediction rule, and pilot test a simple, scalable clinical decision support tool for providers. The overarching goal is to improve clinical outcomes by optimizing medications for patients at the time of prescribing, which is a central mission of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).",Development of a novel medication adherability tool to improve cardiovascular disease management,10132378,K01HL141538,"['Affect ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Color ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' Deglutition ', ' Swallowing ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacists ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' medication prescription ', ' prescribed medication ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Review Literature ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Frequencies ', ' prophylactic ', ' Route ', ' behavior change ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Appearance ', ' Palate ', ' health-related belief ', ' health belief ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' medication compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' systematic review ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' implementation research ', ' virtual ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' successful intervention ', ' Regimen ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' individualized medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapeutic strategy ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' support tools ', ' individual patient ', ' clinical decision support ', ' cardiometabolism ', ' cardiometabolic ', ' side effect ', ' provider behavior ', ' clinician behavior ', ' physician behavior ', ' ']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2021,143581,MA-07
"Investigation of Stereotyped High-Frequency Oscillations with Computational Intelligence for the Prediction of Seizure Onset Zone in Epilepsy PROJECT SUMMARY Neurosurgical therapy of refractory epilepsy requires accurate localization of seizure onset zone (SOZ). In clinical practice, intracranial EEG (iEEG) is recorded in the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) over many days where multiple seizures are recorded to provide information to localize the SOZ. The prolonged monitoring in the EMU adds to the risk of complications and can include intracranial bleeding and potentially death. Recently, high frequency oscillations (HFO) of iEEG between 80 to 500 Hz are highly valued as a promising clinical biomarker for epilepsy. HFOs are believed to be clinically significant, and thus could be used for SOZ localization. However, HFOs can also be recorded from normal and non-epileptic cerebral structures. When defined only by rate or frequency, pathological HFOs are indistinguishable from physiological ones, which limit their application in epilepsy pre-surgical planning. In this proposal, to the best of our knowledge, we show of a recurrent waveform pattern that distinguishes pathological HFOs from physiological ones. In particular, we observed that the SOZ generates repeatedly a set of stereotyped HFO waveforms whereas the HFOs from nonepileptic regions were irregular in their waveform morphology. Based on these observations, using computational tools built on recent advances in sparse coding and unsupervised machine learning techniques, we propose to detect these stereotyped recurrent HFO waveform patterns directly from the continuous iEEG data of adult and pediatric patients and test their prognostic value by correlating the spatial distribution of detected events to clinical findings such as SOZ, resection zone and seizure freedom. We hypothesize that accurate detection of pathologic HFOs in brief iEEG recordings can identify the SOZ and eliminate the necessity of prolonged EMU monitoring and reduce the associated risks. With these motivations, in this project an interdisciplinary team composed of biomedical engineers, epileptologists and neurosurgeons will work together to develop and test novel computational tools to detect stereotyped HFOs and its subtypes in large iEEG datasets recorded with clinical electrodes. Developed algorithms and iEEG data will be shared with the research community to contribute to the reproducible research and help other research groups to develop novel methods. The results of this study will be essential for achieving our group's long term goal of developing an online neural signal processing system for the rapid and accurate identification of SOZ with brief invasive recording. PROJECT NARRATIVE Prolonged iEEG monitoring for SOZ localization does add to the risk of complications and may include serious issues, such as intracranial bleeding, meningoencephalitis, and eventually death. The intellectual merit of this project is to develop computational intelligence tools based on recent advances in sparse coding and unsupervised machine learning techniques to investigate stereotyped high frequency oscillations (HFOs) in long-term iEEG and test the hypothesis whether the automated detection of HFOs will yield accurate and fast identification of SOZ.",Investigation of Stereotyped High-Frequency Oscillations with Computational Intelligence for the Prediction of Seizure Onset Zone in Epilepsy,10131881,R01NS112497,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bio-engineered ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bioengineering ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Environment ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Goals ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' High Frequency Oscillation ', ' Hospitals ', ' Laboratories ', ' Language ', ' Meningoencephalitis ', ' Cerebromeningitis ', ' Encephalomeningitis ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Motivation ', ' Motor Cortex ', ' Patients ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Seizures ', ' Spatial Distribution ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Neocortex ', ' homotypical cortex ', ' isocortex ', ' neopallium ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Lesion ', ' awake ', ' Visual ', ' Neurosurgeon ', ' neuro-surgeon ', ' Cerebrum ', ' cerebral ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Structure ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' axon signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neurotransmission ', ' novel ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Refractory epilepsy ', ' drug-resistant epilepsy ', ' Intractable Epilepsy ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Motor ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Scheme ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' cost ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' prospective ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinical practice ', ' signal processing ', ' pediatric patients ', ' child patients ', ' prognostic value ', ' prognostic ability ', ' prognostic power ', ' prognostic utility ', ' clinical biomarkers ', ' clinically useful biomarkers ', ' computational intelligence ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R01,2021,459231,TX-18
"Multimodal Approaches to Neurobiology of Traumatic Dissociation Dissociative symptoms in traumatized individuals are common, debilitating, and costly; however, little is known about how its biological mechanisms interact with PTSD treatment. Traumatic dissociation broadly encompasses a range of distinct, yet clinically interrelated symptoms: depersonalization, derealization, amnesia, numbing, flashbacks, passive influence phenomena, and identity disturbances. Either alone or in various combinations, these symptoms serve as diagnostic criteria and commonly associated features across multiple psychiatric disorders. Traumatic dissociation is also associated with significant personal and societal burden. Traumatized individuals with dissociative symptoms typically have co-occurring psychiatric conditions, high rates of self-destructive behaviors and suicidality, and are disproportionate treatment utilizers. In addition, they are at increased risk for attrition, non-response and relapse following treatment interventions. Despite the significant and disabling nature of traumatic dissociative symptoms, little is known about the neurobiology of these processes and targeted interventions do not exist.  PTSD treatment studies have neither looked at neural intermediate phenotypes of dissociation, nor how these are associated with psychophysiological and digital phenotypes. Compared to clinical symptom measures, these biological and in-the-moment digital markers of dissociation may more robustly map onto the underlying core aspects of the disorder differentiating dissociation subtypes following childhood and adult trauma. We propose to build upon our prior Exploratory R21 to now capture longitudinal multimodal phenotype data related to dissociation, pre-, post- and during PTSD treatment modalities that include empirically-derived, exposure-based components.  The goals of this study will be 1) to understand the differential biomarkers that map onto dissociative symptoms, and 2) to understand how these biomarkers may best predict trajectory of response to empirically based standard-of-care treatments. For each of these Aims, we will collect Neuroimaging, Physiology, and Digital Phenotyping data, applying computational modeling with multimodal data to provide machine-learning based, unbiased predictive models of dissociative intermediate phenotypes at baseline and longitudinally. This naturalistic study will allow us to map the biology of dissociation, and importantly, the change in dissociative symptoms and underlying biomarkers over time, using naturalistic evidenced-based treatment for PTSD in 130 treatment-seeking patients with PTSD, and a range of dissociative symptoms.  Successful completion of these Aims will provide a novel and powerful understanding of the biological markers of dissociation subtypes following trauma exposure, and will identify biological mechanisms for understanding and treating PTSD with dissociation. Pathological trauma-related dissociation is a significant personal and societal burden. This proposal will examine behavioral and biological correlates of dissociation across imaging, physiology, and digital assessments. Results from this proposal will inform how to identify those at risk for these debilitating symptoms, potential brain regions to target for treatment, and may support a new standard of clinical care for PTSD with dissociation. ",Multimodal Approaches to Neurobiology of Traumatic Dissociation,10129433,R01MH119227,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Amnesia ', ' Amnesia-Memory Loss ', ' Arousal ', ' Sinus Arrhythmia ', ' Attention ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Biology ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Depersonalization ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Numbness ', ' Loss of Sensation ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' Reflex action ', ' Reflex ', ' Relapse ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' post-trauma stress disorder ', ' posttrauma stress disorder ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Dissociation ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' Anterior ', ' Dorsal ', ' Medial ', ' Clinical ', ' Refractory ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Derealizations ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' respiratory ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' skills ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Modality ', ' Emotional ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Pathologic ', ' Process ', ' Self Destructive Behavior ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' pediatric trauma ', ' adolescent trauma ', ' childhood trauma ', ' trauma in children ', ' cost ', ' time use ', ' digital ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Trauma ', ' emotion regulation ', ' emotional regulation ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' clinical care ', ' standard of care ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' heart rate variability ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' targeted biomarker ', ' targeted therapy trials ', ' targeted drug trials ', ' targeted pharmaceutical trials ', ' targeted treatment trials ', ' phenotypic data ', ' disabling symptom ', ' debilitating symptom ', ' trauma exposure ', ' exposure to trauma ', ' multimodal data ', ' multi-modal data ', ' multi-modal datasets ', ' multimodal datasets ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2021,723138,MA-05
"TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial Abstract Adverse outcomes, including death, respiratory failure and renal failure, are common after surgery, and represent a serious public health challenge. Such adverse outcomes can be mitigated through integrated, collaborative health information technology solutions that provide clinicians cognitive and computational support. The chief motivation for the TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial is that a multi-faceted telemedicine solution has the potential to facilitate the dynamic assessment of risk, diagnose negative patient trajectories, and implement evidence-based practices. The net result for patients would be improved safety and outcomes. Our telemedicine solution, called the Anesthesiology Control Tower (ACT), encompasses real-time patient data integration from the electronic health record, clinician decision support, machine learning algorithms that predict adverse outcomes, and remote monitoring for the operating room (OR). This conceptualization of sophisticated remote monitoring for the OR is somewhat analogous to an air traffic control tower for a busy airport. The innovative TECTONICS trial will build on a series of preliminary studies (funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the National Science Foundation) that have (i) established the usefulness and usability of a prototype telemedicine ACT; (ii) customized and enhanced decision-support alerts for the ACT, based on clinician user feedback; (iii) designed, developed, and tested machine learning algorithms that predict adverse postoperative outcomes; and (iv) established the feasibility of conducing a real-world randomized trial of the prototype ACT. The TECTONICS trial builds logically on these preliminary studies. Aim 1 is to show that we can implement and sustain an integrated ACT system. As part of this, we will iteratively assess the accuracy of our machine learning algorithms and modify them to improve their ability to predict in real time when patients are at high risk for experiencing negative outcomes. Aim 2 is to understand how the ACT system affects clinicians’ (anesthesiologists and certified registered nurse anesthetists [CRNAs]) thinking, decision-making and behavior. This understanding will help us to enhance the ACT system, improve workflow processes in the ACT and in the OR, and improve collaborative interactions between anesthesiologists and CRNAs. Aim 3 is to conduct a rigorous clinical trial. We will evaluate the impact of the ACT system on the quality of care in the OR, and clinical outcomes such as intraoperative awareness, and postoperative delirium, renal failure, respiratory failure, and 30-day mortality. TECTONICS will be the first practical and scientifically rigorous trial of a telemedicine solution for the operating room, and will inform the usefulness of incorporating such technology in routine care of surgical patients, including under-resourced healthcare settings. With many millions undergoing surgery yearly, this feasible application of technology could signal a major shift in the safety and quality of perioperative care, and translate into substantial societal gain. Narrative Adverse outcomes, including death, are common after surgery and represent a public health challenge. There is an urgent need to assess the potential usefulness of a remote technology-based control center for the operating room to dynamically assess risk, diagnose negative patient trajectories, implement evidence-based practices, and improve outcomes.

We used this observatory to freely and openly share calcium imaging data from ~60,000 cells from 221 running mice viewing standard visual stimuli; in October 2019, we will release Neuropixels electrophysiology recordings from ~100,000 cells from 100 mice under the same conditions, all registered to a common anatomical coordinate system (CCFv3). We wish to open the Brain Observatory pipeline to the community, enabling theoretical, computational, and experimental scientists to test sophisticated hypotheses on brain functions in a process analogous to astronomical observatories that survey the night sky. Our observatory, called OpenScope, will accept, once a year, experimental proposals from external scientists, which will be reviewed by a panel of leading experts for their feasibility and scientific merit. The Allen Institute will carry out the selected experiments by following verified, reproducible, and open protocols for in vivo single- and multi-area two photon calcium imaging and Neuropixels electrophysiology, making the data freely available to these scientists. Funding for this proposal will give the entire community access to a modern experimental platform that operates under standardized, reproducible, and high-throughput conditions. This resource will be particularly attractive to the computational and theoretical communities with limited access to experimental facilities. Our project has the potential to transform systems neuroscience by implementing an observatory model that has been tremendously successful in other scientific fields. By reducing variability in training, imaging and quality control across animals and experiments and by lowering the barrier to select, test, and validate the best ideas, we hope to accelerate progress toward an integrated view of neural circuits. Project narrative Scientific fields such as astronomy and particle physics have had tremendous success using an “observatory” based approach to data collection, in which researchers propose experiments to be carried out in centralized facilities too complex and expensive to be operated by individual laboratories. We will apply this model to neuroscience by opening the Allen Institute Brain Observatory’s state-of-the-art optical and electrophysiological data collection pipelines to the entire neuroscience community. This will lower barriers to testing new hypotheses about brain function, bring in new computational and theoretical talents into the field, and enhance the reproducibility of results in brain research, thereby accelerating progress toward an integrated understanding of neural activity in health and disease.",OpenScope: A Platform for High-Throughput and Reproducible Neurophysiology Open to External Scientists to Test Impactful Theories of Brain Function,9967446,U24NS113646,"['Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Animal Experiments ', ' Training ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' success ', ' visual stimulus ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Core Facility ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reproducibility ', ' in vivo ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' two-photon ', ' 2-photon ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' data acquisition ', ' implantation ', ' brain research ', ' data format ', ' cloud based ', ' imaging platform ', ' BRAIN initiative ', ' Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies initiative ', ' particle physics ', ' flavor physics ', ' web portal ', ' internet portal ', ' on-line portal ', ' online portal ', ' web-based portal ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' data standards ', ' data standardization ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Astronomy ', ' space science ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Calcium ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Glass ', ' Hawaii ', ' Health ', ' Incentives ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Maps ', ' Modernization ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Physiology ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Quality Control ', ' Reproducibility of Results ', ' Reproducibility of Findings ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Running ', ' Silicon ', ' Si element ', ' Standardization ', ' statistics ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Talents ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Technical Expertise ', ' technical skills ', ' falls ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Blinded ', ' base ', ' ']",NINDS,ALLEN INSTITUTE,U24,2021,1501246,WA-07
"Integrating a culturally competent APOL1 genetic testing program into living donor evaluation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Living donor (LD) kidney transplantation is the optimal treatment for patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). However, LDs take on a higher risk of future ESKD themselves. African American (AA) LDs have an even greater, 3.3-fold, risk of ESKD than white LDs post-donation. Because evidence suggests that Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) risk variants contribute to this greater risk, transplant nephrologists are increasingly using APOL1 testing to evaluate LD candidates of African ancestry. However, nephrologists do not consistently perform genetic counseling with LD candidates about APOL1 due to a lack of knowledge and skill in counseling about APOL1. Without proper counseling, APOL1 testing will magnify LD candidates’ decisional conflict about donating, jeopardizing their informed consent. Given their elevated risk of ESRD post-donation, and AAs’ widely-held cultural concerns about genetic testing, it is ethically critical to protect AA LD candidates’ safety through APOL1 testing in a culturally competent manner to improve informed decisions about donating.  No transplant programs have integrated APOL1 testing into LD evaluation in a culturally competent manner. Clinical “chatbots,” mobile apps that use artificial intelligence to provide genetic information to patients and relieve constraints on clinicians’ time, can improve informed treatment decisions and reduce decisional conflict. The chatbot “Gia,” created by a medical genetics company, can be adapted to any condition. However, no chatbot on APOL1 is currently available. No counseling training programs are available for nephrologists to counsel AA LDs about APOL1 and donation in a culturally competent manner. Given the shortage of genetic counselors, increasing nephrologists’ genetic literacy is critical to integrating genetic testing into practice.  The objective of this study is to culturally adapt and evaluate the effectiveness of an APOL1 testing program for AA LDs at two transplant centers serving large AA LD populations (Chicago, IL, and Washington, DC). The APOL1 testing program will evaluate the effect of the culturally competent testing, chatbot, and counseling on AA LD candidates’ decisional conflict about donating, preparedness for decision-making, willingness to donate, and satisfaction with informed consent. The specific aims are to: 1. Adapt Gia and transplant counseling to APOL1 for use in routine clinical practice 2. Evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention on decisional conflict, preparedness, and willingness to  donate in a pre-post design 3. Evaluate the implementation of this intervention into clinical practice by using the RE-AIM framework to  longitudinally evaluate nephrologist counseling practices and LDs’ satisfaction with informed consent.  The impact of this study will be the creation of a model for APOL1 testing of AA LDs, which can then be implemented nationally via implementation science approaches. APOL1 will serve as a model for integrating culturally competent genetic testing into transplant and other practices to improve patient informed consent. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) risk variants may contribute to African American living kidney donors’ even greater (3.3-fold) risk of end-stage renal disease post-donation than white living kidney donors. However, transplant physicians do not consistently use APOL1 genetic testing or counsel African American living donor candidates about APOL1, which may undermine candidates’ ability to give informed consent about donating and exacerbate health disparities in living donation and transplantation. By evaluating the effectiveness of a culturally competent APOL1 genetic testing program, the proposed study will provide valuable knowledge about the potential to rapidly scale up APOL1 testing nationally as a novel and ethical approach to protect African American living donors’ safety and enhance their informed consent.",Integrating a culturally competent APOL1 genetic testing program into living donor evaluation,10180256,R01DK128207,"['Adoption ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Altruism ', ' altruistic ', ' Apolipoproteins ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Bioethics ', ' Biomedical Ethics ', ' Chicago ', ' Communities ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Counseling ', ' Decision Making ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Dialysis ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Family ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Future ', ' Genetic Counseling ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Genotype ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Hospitals ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Renal Grafting ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' kidney tx ', ' literacy ', ' Medicine ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' African American ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' African ', ' satisfaction ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Clinical Practice Guideline ', ' Genetic ', ' Living Donors ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' culturally competent ', ' cultural competence ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' implementation science ', ' high risk ', ' clinical practice ', ' shared decision making ', ' risk variant ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk allele ', ' risk gene ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk loci ', ' risk locus ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile device application ', ' genetic information ', ' genetic counselor ', ' transplant centers ', ' optimal treatments ', ' optimal therapies ', ' chatbot ', ' chat bot ', ' living kidney donor ', ' live kidney donor ', ' genetic testing ', ' gene testing ', ' gene-based testing ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance ', ' RE-AIM ', ' reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation, and maintenance ', ' implementation intervention ', ' implementation outcomes ', ' ']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,714612,IL-07
"AC/DC: Artificial intelligence and Computer visioning to assess Dietary Composition ABSTRACT Dietary intake is a complex human behavior that drives disease risk and corresponding economic and healthcare burdens worldwide. Poor diet is the leading cause of death in the US and a known driver of obesity – a global epidemic. A major contributor to poor diet is food eaten away from home, such as restaurant foods. Research has shown that tracking one’s weight and dietary intake significantly improve success toward weight loss and maintenance goals; however, this type of tracking is burdensome, prone to error, and difficult to estimate for restaurant foods. Accurate approaches and tools to evaluate food and nutrient intake are essential in monitoring the nutritional status of individuals. There is a critical need for real-time data capture that minimizes burden and reduces error. While progress has been made, there is no tool available that accurately and automatically estimates foods left unconsumed in a meal. Two major limitations of existing systems is the reliance of a fiducial marker for food detection and volume estimation, and reliance on humans – either the respondent or a trained researcher – to estimate the portion of food leftover. This application leverages novel technology to remove those limitations. The long-term research goal is to utilize digital imaging (DI), artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision (CV) techniques to develop a novel hybrid methodology for rapid, accurate measurement of dietary intake. To attain this goal, our objective in this R21 application is to refine and test a system architecture that (a) uses digital images to record dietary intake in real-time and (b) uses AI and CV techniques to identify food/beverage items and determine amounts leftover. We plan to build on our current prototype in which digital food images are captured before and after the meal, analyzed to detect the food items, a three-dimensional (3-D) virtual model constructed, and volume remaining after the meal estimated, which will be used to calculate the amount leftover based on the initial volume. Volume consumed will be converted to weight and linked to public-use nutrition information. These calorie estimates will be compared against calories those from (a) DIs coded by trained research staff and (b) weighed plate waste methodology. Our expectation is to develop a valid system architecture for rapidly estimating dietary intake. The outcome of this proposal is expected to have a significant positive impact, enabling nutrition and health researchers to collect high-quality food consumption data in real world settings, increasing knowledge of dietary patterns and improving capacity to assess dietary interventions. This work will lead to an R01 application that will expand food types and meal settings and test the utility of our system among consumers. Project Narrative Solutions to address the global obesity epidemic are urgently needed. Research has shown that tracking one’s weight and dietary intake significantly improve success toward weight loss and maintenance goals; however, this type of tracking is burdensome, prone to error, and difficult to estimate for restaurant foods, a known driver of obesity.

"Identification of biologically relevant subtypes of hidradenitis suppurativa Project Summary Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a neglected, prevalent, chronic, stigmatizing, and debilitating disease that has recently been prioritized for study by NIAMS. Evidence suggests that some HS patients choose to self-manage symptoms remaining unconnected to healthcare, and some seek medical care for repeated outbreaks of boils but never receive a diagnosis. Such ‘hidden populations’ create challenges for designing research studies that are generalizable. Precision medicine initiatives and resources offer opportunities to rapidly increase our knowledge about biological causes of HS and to improve the care that HS patients receive. For example, the NIH has made considerable investments in the development of data repositories that link genetic data to EHR for hundreds of thousands of patients, including the NHGRI-funded eMERGE Network and the NIH-funded All of Us Research Program. Columbia University investigators are integral members of these nationwide programs, both as a recruitment site, as well as a data and research center (5U01HG008680, 1OT2OD026556). Engaging research participants who are willing to contribute longitudinal data is a major obstacle to precision medicine initiatives. The public’s use of the Internet and social media to obtain and exchange health-related information has created opportunities to rapidly and efficiently assemble large longitudinal cohorts, yet there are important differences from traditional research methods and best practice guidelines have yet to be developed. Columbia University is at the forefront of the development and application of these methods. A major challenge to implementing precision medicine arises from patients who share a diagnosis but have different biological causes of disease. HS patients have a high burden of comorbidities and we hypothesize that sets of comorbidities that tend to present together in individual patients can be used to identify biologically relevant disease subtypes. Here we will use three approaches to identify patterns of comorbidities within patients, to characterize the generalizability of the results from studies conducted in EHR, and to use genetic data to biologically validate comorbidities and resolve causality underlying disease associations. Training in biomedical informatics and Internet-based survey research will allow the applicant to use EHR data and Internet resources for assembling cohorts to conduct these studies, and complement her previous training in epidemiology, biostatistics, molecular biology and human genetics, providing fluency across several domains that are crucial for advancing precision medicine initiatives. Completion of this proposal will achieve the applicant’s long-term goal of obtaining advanced training aimed at implementing precision medicine in the treatment of skin disease. Project Narrative This project addresses the imperative needs of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) patients who suffer from pain, stigma, diminished quality of life, decreased work productivity, and increased healthcare costs that arise from managing a difficult-to-treat, debilitating disease with a high burden of comorbidities. We will conduct studies of HS comorbidities to identify biologically distinct subclasses of HS in large samples of patients using data in electronic health records and data collected from Internet surveys. This work will improve the precision of HS diagnoses and set up the infrastructure for future large-scale studies of HS.",Identification of biologically relevant subtypes of hidradenitis

"PROTECT: optima4BP 2.0: prediction of Optimal Treatment and Route to achieve and maintain BP Target Need. In the US, 40 million patients with hypertension (HTN) have their blood pressure (BP) uncontrolled. BP above clinical Target even for a few months increases the risk for stroke (35-40%), heart failure (HF) (up to 64%), myocardial infarction (MI) (15-25%). Physician-nurse-pharmacist resource-intensive demonstrations in achieving & maintaining BP Target have shown promising results, but their real-life deployment was found unsustainable long-term. As a result, a process-standardized and sustainable solution is acutely needed.  Solution. In response to this need, Optima Integrated Health developed optima4BP 1.0. It is a first-in-class artificial intelligence (AI) that simulates the process of clinical reasoning undertaken by the treating physician in optimizing the anti-HTN treatment towards BP Target. Just like the physician, optima4BP 1.0 cannot determine upfront the needed Optimal Treatment (OT) to achieve & maintain BP Target for 1-2 years. PROTECT [optima4BP 2.0: prediction of Optimal Treatment and route to achieve and maintain BP Target] proposes to establish upfront the personalized OT. The OT can then be used to select the shortest and safest treatment modification route needed to achieve & maintain BP Target. Phase II Goal. Build optima4BP 2.0.  Phase I. Phase I Prior Work demonstrated that k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), an AI model, can predict with ≥ 80% confidence the correct anti-HTN treatment, when compared to physician decision.  Phase II. optima4BP 2.0 will predict the Optimal Treatment and route to achieve & maintain BP Target.  Optimal Treatment data-mining source. PROTECT will use the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial, 2015) and ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes, 2010) clinical trial data. They represent the foundation of the most current anti-HTN treatment management national guidelines.  Aim 1. Build kNN. Hypothesis. kNN can predict the proximity (clinical relevance) of a patient to an Optimal Treatment (OT). Milestone. Achieve ≥ 90% accuracy of prediction to physician decision. Phase I Data Preparation protocol will be applied to the SPRINT & ACCORD data. Then, the kNN Ensemble Learning function will be built to select the Optimal Treatment with the highest demonstrated efficacy by comparing the choice from 3 computational approaches developed and tested during Phase I.  Aim 2. Build the Optimal Treatment Route (OTR). Hypothesis. Knowing the Current and Optimal Treatment (OT), an OTR can be built. Milestone. Safest Route: Achieve 100% exclusion of treatments that led to an adverse event in similar patient populations. Shortest Route: Achieve ≥30% reduction in number of treatment changes compared to physician route. The OTR will be built by comparing at each Step on the Route how similar each Candidate Treatment is to the OT through a computed similarity assessment.  optima4BP 2.0 aims to establish a process-standardized & sustainable solution with the goal of reducing the incidence of stroke, HF, MI and death resulting from uncontrolled hypertension. In the US, 40 million patients with hypertension have their blood pressure uncontrolled.

"Machine Learning to Reduce Hypertension Treatment Clinical Inertia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hypertension (HTN) is a main risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). It can be managed through use of antihypertensive medications and lifestyle modification (i.e., diet and exercise). Adults who have controlled BP have close to a 50% decreased risk of CVD-related mortality compared to those with uncontrolled BP. However, using current guidelines, over 40% of the 100 million US adults with HTN have controlled BP. Thus, uncontrolled BP remains a significant and largely unchecked public health issue in the United States. Interventions to improve BP control exist (i.e., medication adherence and diet and exercise), but they are mostly complex and resource intensive. If resources to improve HTN control are to be efficiently used, identifying patients who are likely to have persistently uncontrolled BP may provide an opportunity for targeted and tailored intervention and close monitoring. Application of a machine learning algorithm (MLA) to electronic medical record (EMR) data could identify patients likely to have uncontrolled BP. The use and amount of data in EMRs continues to expand and improve in quality. The Temple Health EMR contains extensive demographic, clinical, prescribing, and dispensing data. MLAs are ideally suited to harness this complex and abundant data. MLAs recognize patterns in data that may be difficult to detect by researchers and identify variables that are important for prediction of an outcome. They have been used to predict hospital length of stay, hospital mortality rates, and even detect diabetic retinopathy. The objective of the major study proposed in this K01 application is to first, develop and validate a random forest MLA to predict risk of uncontrolled BP among adults with HTN. Second, identify barriers and facilitators to implementing an MLA-clinical decision support (CDS) tool that predicts uncontrolled BP into clinical settings by conducting key-informant interviews and focus groups with primary care clinicians and patients. Third, Compare clinical management of hypertension with and without a prototype of an MLA-CDS tool through a case-vignette study. These aims align with my career goal of lowering CVD risk in adults. I will accomplish these aims with the help of an accomplished mentoring team focused on hypertension and antihypertensive medication adherence, machine learning, and qualitative interviewing and CDS-tool development. During the timeframe of this study I will gain experience in (1) MLA development and validation, (2) qualitative interviewing skills to develop CDS tools for clinicians, and (3) leadership skills for principal investigators. These skills will allow me to become an independent investigator focused on identifying people at high risk for chronic disease related to CVD events and developing tools to assist physicians in lowering CVD risk at the population level.

"Developing scalable algorithms to incorporate unstructured electronic health records for causal inference based on real-world data Project Summary/Abstract The routine operation of the US Healthcare system produces an abundance of electronically-stored data that captures the care of patients as it is provided in settings outside of controlled research environments. The potential for utilizing these data to inform future treatment choices and improve patient care and outcomes of all patients in the very system that generates the data is widely acknowledged. Given these key properties of the routine-care data and the abundance of electronic healthcare databases covering millions of patients, it is critical to strengthen the rigor of analyses of such data. Our group has previously developed an analytic approach to reduce bias when analyzing routine-care databases, which has proven effective in more than 50 empirical research studies across a range of topics and data sources. However, this approach currently cannot incorporate free-text information that is recorded in electronic health records, such as clinical notes and reports. This limitation has left a large amount of rich patient information underutilized for clinical research. We thus aim to adapt and refine a set of established computerized natural language processing algorithms that can identify and extract useful information from the clinical notes and reports in electronic health records and incorporate them into our validated analytical approach for balancing background risks of different comparison groups, a key step to ensure fair evaluation when comparing different therapeutic options. To test this newly integrated and augmented approach, we will implement and adapt it in simulation studies where we can evaluate and improve the performance of these new analytic methods in a controlled but realistic fashion. In addition, we will assess the performance of our new approach in 8 practical studies comparing medical or surgical treatments that are highly relevant to patients. To ensure highest level of data completeness and quality, we have linked multiple healthcare utilization (claims) databases, spanning from 2007 to 2016, with 3 electronic health records systems, including one each in Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Texas. This data will allow testing of our newly integrated approach in a variety of care delivery systems and data environments, which will be very informative for the application of our products in the real-world settings. Narrative The project will yield a highly flexible and effective analytical method for reducing confounding bias in studies that utilize routine-care data to compare effects of medical or surgical treatments. This method will enable researchers to leverage a large amount of patient information recorded in the clinical notes and reports that are contained within electronic health records to adjust for differences in background risks of different comparison groups. Our proposal can improve the quality of evidence based on electronic healthcare data generated in the routine-care settings to better inform patient care and optimal prescribing.",Developing scalable algorithms to incorporate unstructured electronic health records for causal inference based on real-world data,10168610,R01LM013204,"['Algorithms ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Confounding Factors (Epidemiology) ', ' Confounding Variables ', ' Epidemiologic Confounding Factor ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Knowledge acquisition ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Gold ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Influentials ', ' Manuals ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Methods ', ' Names ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' North Carolina ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Semantics ', ' sound ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Empirical Research ', ' Knowledge ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' Performance ', ' care delivery ', ' Proxy ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' research study ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Stratification ', ' Validation ', ' Text ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' safety study ', ' comparison group ', ' comparator group ', ' cost ', ' computerized ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' evidence base ', ' routine care ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' operation ', ' treatment choice ', ' high dimensionality ', ' care outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' preservation ', ' unstructured data ', ' Comparative Effectiveness Research ', ' comparative effectiveness study ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' Data Store ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NLM,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,469927,MA-07
"Neuroscience Gateway to Enable Dissemination of Computational And Data Processing Tools And Software. Abstract (Proposal title: Neuroscience Gateway to Enable Dissemination of Computational and Data Processing Tools and Software.): This proposal presents a focused plan for expanding the capabilities of the Neuroscience Gateway (NSG) to meet the evolving needs of neuroscientists engaged in computationally intensive research. The NSG project began in 2012 with support from the NSF. Its initial goal was to catalyze progress in computational neuroscience by reducing technical and administrative barriers that neuroscientists faced in large scale modeling projects involving tools and software which require and run efficiently on high performance computing (HPC) resources. NSG's success is reflected in the facts that (1) its base of registered users has grown continually since it started operation in early 2013 (more than 800 at present), (2) every year the NSG team successfully acquires ever larger allocations of supercomputer time (recently more than 10,000,000 core hours/year) on academic HPC resources of the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery (XSEDE – that coordinates NSF supercomputer centers) program by writing proposals that go through an extremely competitive peer review process, and (3) it has contributed to large number of publications and Ph.D thesis. In recent years experimentalists, cognitive neuroscientists and others have begun using NSG for brain image data processing, data analysis and machine learning. NSG now provides over 20 tools on HPC resources for modeling, simulation and data processing. While NSG is currently well used by the neuroscience community, there is increasing interest from that community in applying it to a wider range of tasks than originally conceived. For example, some are trying to use it as an environment for dissemination of lab-developed tools, even though NSG is not suitable for that use because of delays from the batch queue wait times of production HPC resources, and lack of features and resources for an interactive, graphical, and collaborative environment needed for tool development, benchmarking and testing. “Forced” use of NSG for development and dissemination makes NSG's operators a “person-in-the-middle” bottleneck in the process. Another issue is that newly developed data processing tools require high throughput computing (HTC) usage mode, as opposed to HPC, but currently NSG does not provide access to compute resources suitable for HTC. Additionally, data processing workflows require features such as the ability to transfer large size data, process shared data, and visualize output results, which are not currently available on NSG. The work we propose will enhance NSG by adding the features that it needs to be a suitable and efficient dissemination environment for lab-developed neuroscience tools to the broader neuroscience community. This will allow tool developers to disseminate their lab-developed tools on NSG taking advantage of the current functionalities that are being well served on NSG for the last six years such as a growing user base, an easy user interface, an open environment, the ability to access and run jobs on powerful compute resources, availability of free supercomputer time, a well-established training and outreach program, and a functioning user support system. All of these well-functioning features of NSG will make it an ideal environment for dissemination and use of lab-developed computational and data processing neuroscience tools. The Neuroscience Gateway (NSG) was first implemented to enable large scale computational modeling of brain cells and circuits used to study neural function in health and disease. This new project extends NSG's utility to support development, dissemination and use of new tools by the neuroscience community for analyzing enormous data sets produced by advanced experimental methods in neuroscience.",Neuroscience Gateway to Enable Dissemination of Computational And Data Processing Tools And Software.,10186744,U24EB029005,"['Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Data Correlations ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Peer Review ', ' Production ', ' Psychologist ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Reaction Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Response Time ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Running ', ' Science ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Workload ', ' Work Load ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' computational neuroscience ', ' image processing ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Training ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' interest ', ' brain cell ', ' success ', ' supercomputer ', ' high-end computing ', ' High Performance Computing ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' neural function ', ' Neurophysiology - biologic function ', ' Social Support System ', ' Support System ', ' Modeling ', ' outreach program ', ' response ', ' bio-imaging ', ' biomedical imaging ', ' bioimaging ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Data ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Cognitive ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' tool development ', ' data sharing ', ' operation ', ' collaborative environment ', ' Business-Friendly Atmosphere ', ' business-friendly environment ', ' collaborative atmosphere ', ' interactive atmosphere ', ' interactive environment ', ' interdisciplinary atmosphere ', ' interdisciplinary environment ', ' peer-group atmosphere ', ' peer-group environment ', ' webinar ', ' Data Science ', ' open data ', ' open science ', ' open-source data ', ' Wait Time ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NIBIB,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U24,2021,377473,CA-52
"Preventing medication dispensing errors in pharmacy practice with interpretable machine intelligence PROJECT SUMMARY Medical errors are the 3rd leading cause of death in the United States behind cancer and cardiovascular disease. The largest proportion of medical errors involve medications. Medication errors result in 3 million outpatient medical appointments, 1 million emergency department visits, and 125,000 hospital admissions each year. Astoundingly, over 4 billion prescriptions are dispensed every year in the United States alone. Although dispensing error rates are generally low at 0.06%, the sheer volume of dispensed medications translates to 2.4 million incorrectly dispensed medications each year. In the pharmacy, dispensing errors arise when pharmacists do not detect that the medication filled inside a prescription vial is different from the medication ordered on the prescription's label. These dispensing errors can result in patient harm, added strain on the healthcare system, and costly legal action against the pharmacy. Machine intelligence (MI) can be employed to assist in the verification process to help avoid dangerous and costly pharmacy dispensing errors.4–6 However for the human-MI partnership to function optimally, the MI should be capable of conveying accurate information that encourages providers to make sound cognitive decisions such that optimal trust is maintained, and temporal and cognitive demand is reduced. Imperative to this goal is to design MI from which interpretable information can be extracted, convey this information in an effective manner and calibrate user's trust in MI as either over-trust or under-trust can lead to near miss and incident errors. This proposed project will further our knowledge for designing interpretable MI outputs and inform the development of MI models that encourage pharmacy staff to make sound clinical decisions that lead to better patient outcomes while improving work-life at lower costs of care. This study develops interpretable MI methods in the context of medication images classification and designs effective MI advice and reasoning that lead to lower cognitive demand and increased trust in the MI. Our hypothesis is that interpretable MI will lead to improved work performance and more calibrated trust compared to uninterpretable M. The objectives of this proposal are to: 1) design interpretable machine intelligence to double-check dispensed medication images in real-time; 2) evaluate changes in pharmacy staff trust due to the long-term use of interpretable machine intelligence; and 3) determine the effect of interpretable machine intelligence on long-term pharmacy staff work performance. PROJECT NARRATIVE Medical errors are the 3rd leading cause of death in the United States behind cancer and cardiovascular disease and the largest proportion of medical errors involve medications. These dispensing errors occur approximately 2,400,000 times every year in the United States alone and can result in patient safety issues and add unnecessarily to the already strained healthcare system.The objectives of this proposal are to: 1) design interpretable machine intelligence to double-check dispensed medication images in real-time; 2) evaluate changes in pharmacy staff trust due to the long-term use of interpretable machine intelligence; and 3) determine the effect of interpretable machine intelligence on long-term pharmacy staff work performance.",Preventing medication dispensing errors in pharmacy practice with interpretable machine intelligence,10183536,R01LM013624,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Decision Making ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Medication Errors ', ' medication administration errors ', ' Methods ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Pharmacists ', ' Research ', ' sound ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Vial device ', ' Vial ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Trust ', ' tool ', ' Medical Mistakes ', ' Medical Errors ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Stream ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' medical appointment ', ' eye tracking ', ' visual tracking ', ' Modeling ', ' patient safety ', ' Provider ', ' job performance ', ' work performance ', ' Performance at work ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Legal ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Cognitive ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' support tools ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' care costs ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,288814,MI-12
"Machine learning algorithms to analyze large medical image datasets Machine learning (ML) is poised to enable faster and more accurate interpretation of medical images by augmenting the capabilities of experts. The cost and difficulty of generating expert quality labelled image data is the primary limitation preventing faster progress and deployment in more domains. Success of ML techniques for medical image interpretation may reduce the burden on radiologists, reducing errors arising from fatigue or interruption, while simultaneously reducing costs and increasing speed and accuracy for patients. Our overall objective for this research is to dramatically reduce the burden of creating high quality reference labels by requiring only a small set of such labels from experts. We propose to address this problem by creating innovative algorithms that will construct reference quality labelled data with little input from domain experts, thus dramatically reducing the cost of labelling. This will enable us to apply ML techniques to generate high quality labels of the large amounts of unlabeled data that are already available, which in turn will facilitate the assessment of potential quantitative imaging biomarkers. We will develop, extend and evaluate novel algorithms that represent three distinct strategies for reducing labelling cost. These three strategies are learning from unlabelled data incorporating a novel strategy for characterizing uncertainty, optimizing sample selection for expert quality labelling with a novel form of Active Learning especially suited for deep learning, and reducing the cost of achieving quality labeling by replacing or augmenting an expert with a crowd of inexperts. We will then implement and distribute these novel algorithms, facilitating the replication of our experiments. Finally, we will demonstrate the practical efficacy of these three strategies by applying them to the important challenge of identifying quantitative imaging biomarkers that best capture alterations in brain structure that are associated with characteristics of ASD. These fundamental advances in informatics algorithms will reduce the cost and increase the rate of obtaining quality labels, which will in turn facilitate the widespread adoption and deployment of machine learning algorithms for image interpretation. Ultimately, this will stimulate the development of new imaging biomarkers that hold the potential to dramatically improve clinical decision-making and patient outcomes.

"Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults PROJECT SUMMARY The purpose of this study is to examine how access to dental care among low-income adults is impacted by state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, dental coverage, cost-sharing and dentist reimbursement. Oral health is integral to overall health, economic productivity and well-being. Yet access to dental care continues to be a major public health problem for low-income adults, leading to untreated disease, pain, poor systemic health and substantial economic burden. In recent years, several policy changes under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) such as Medicaid expansion and dependent care coverage could significantly impact access to dental care among the poor non-elderly adults. In addition, there is extensive cross-state variation in terms of dental benefits covered for Medicaid adults. These variations provide natural experiments to examine the effect of Medicaid policies on access to dental care. Moreover, under the current health reform discussions, state Medicaid programs are anticipated to gain autonomy in resource allocation, yet may receive significantly less federal funding, making the need for robust evidence on relative effectiveness of Medicaid policy alternatives available to the states paramount. The overarching goal of this application is to advance the research career of the candidate (Dr. Singhal) by protecting her time for training and research on these critical issues in oral health policy. This goal will be accomplished through additional training in complementary disciplines of econometrics and machine learning, and their application to estimate the impacts of Medicaid coverage and payment generosities on access to dental care. The project brings together complementary secondary data from multiple sources including: large national survey data (National Health Interview Survey), administrative enrollment and claims data (Medicaid Analytic eXtract) and linked survey and claims data. Leveraging these data and training resources, this project will: 1) develop synthetic indices of Medicaid dental coverage and payment generosities; 2) estimate the effect of each policy alternative and combined generosity indices on various measures of access to dental care; and 3) predict the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives and their combinations on access to dental care. We will use econometric methods including instrumental variables, difference-in-difference and regression discontinuity models to develop the generosity indices and to estimate the impact of Medicaid generosity. To develop and validate the predictive model, we will use supervised machine learning approaches (e.g. decision tree learning) using linked survey and claims data. The results will provide evidence needed to inform future strategies to ensure efficient use of health care resources to reduce oral health disparities. The completion of this project will also enable Dr. Singhal to establish a research program as an independent research investigator with support from her multi-disciplinary mentoring and advising teams and the vibrant research community at Boston University. PROJECT NARRATIVE Access to dental care is a major public health problem among low-income adults, as evidenced by declining rates of dental care utilization, high unmet dental need, and the increasing rate of emergency department visits for dental problems by this vulnerable population. The research plan of this career development award aims to: 1) examine how state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, coverage and dentist reimbursement impact access to dental care among low-income adults, and 2) develop a model to predict the impact of hypothetical policy changes. A clearer understanding of the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives available to states is critical to ensuring the efficient use of healthcare resources and achieving NIDCR’s strategic goal to reduce income-based disparities in access to and outcomes of oral health care services.",Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults,10198898,K08DE027720,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Boston ', ' Communities ', ' Cost Control ', ' Cost Containment ', ' Dental Care ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Health Services ', ' Dentists ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Environment ', ' Expenditure ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Health Services ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' services research ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' indexing ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' pressure ', ' Production ', ' Productivity ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Policy ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' Cost Sharing ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' population survey ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Health Care Reform ', ' Health Reform ', ' Healthcare Reform ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Dental ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Policies ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Structure ', ' payment ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Improve Access ', ' National Health Interview Survey ', ' NIDCR ', ' NIDR ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' cost ', ' health economics ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Natural experiment ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' evidence base ', ' population health ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' health care service ', ' healthcare service ', ' relative effectiveness ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' decision tree learning ', ' econometrics ', ' multiple data sources ', ' ']",NIDCR,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,K08,2021,130317,MA-07
"Evidence to improve heat warning effectiveness in reducing morbidity and mortality. Project Summary/Abstract  While exposure to high ambient temperature (i.e., heat) has long been recognized as a threat to public health, the burden of illness and death attributable to heat in the US remains high. In an effort to reduce heat- related mortality and morbidity, the US National Weather Service (NWS) issues heat alerts in advance of forecasted extreme heat events to communicate these risks to the public and government officials. However, it is largely unknown: (1) what are the optimal metrics of heat stress to inform when to issue heat alerts, (2) how effective are heat alerts in protecting the public’s health and (3) what factors make heat alerts comparatively more or less effective in some places or in some people versus others. In the absence of such information, we will fail to maximize the public health benefits of heat alerts.  The goals of this proposal are to identify the optimal health-based and location-specific metrics for issuing heat alerts, to estimate the causal benefits of heat alerts, and to identify characteristics of individuals or communities associated with the greatest reductions in morbidity or mortality following heat alerts. Specifically, using national claims data on deaths and hospital admissions among the large, geographically diverse population of >60 million US Medicare beneficiaries age ≥65 years enrolled between 2001 and 2015, and on emergency department visits among >130 million participants of all ages from one of the nation’s largest health insurers, we propose to: (Aim 1) Use novel machine learning methods to identify the heat metric(s) (e.g., heat index, ambient temperature, spatial synoptic classification, wet bulb globe temperature, absolute humidity) that best predict excess heat-related deaths, emergency hospitalizations, and emergency departments visits in each location, (Aim 2) estimate the causal effects of NWS heat alerts on rates of mortality, hospitalizations, and emergency department visits across the country and within groups stratified by health outcome, sex, and age group, and (Aim 3) assess how the benefits of heat alerts vary across characteristics of communities.  Key innovations of this proposal include a very large sample size, geographic diversity encompassing the entire US, the assessment across multiple health endpoints and age groups, and the use of sophisticated methods in statistical learning and causal inference. Collectively, the findings from this proposal will provide meteorologists, public health and emergency management officials, and local policy-makers with critical information to better protect public health during extreme heat events and guide more targeted future research on strategies to mitigate the adverse health effects of heat. Project Narrative Extreme heat is recognized as an important threat to public health, and the burden of illness and death attributable to heat in the US remains high. In an effort to reduce heat-related mortality and morbidity, the US National Weather Service (NWS) issues heat alerts in advance of forecast extreme heat events to communicate these risks to the public and local government officials, although it remains largely unknown whether such alerts are effective in protecting people. We propose to provide forecasters and public health officials across the country with location-specific, health-based evidence as to the effectiveness of heat alerts and insights into how to improve them to better protect the public’s health.",Evidence to improve heat warning effectiveness in reducing morbidity and mortality.,10051418,R01ES029950,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Air Conditioning ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Government Agencies ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Humidity ', ' indexing ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Local Government ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Seasons ', ' Temperature ', ' United States ', ' Weather ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Government Officials ', ' Sample Size ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Heat Stress Disorders ', ' Heat Stress ', ' Heat Stress Syndromes ', ' heat-related illness ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' Services ', ' age group ', ' 65+ years old ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' old age ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' response ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' beneficiary ', ' attributable mortality ', ' attributable death ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' comparative ', ' evidence base ', ' public health emergency ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' extreme heat ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' statistical learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIEHS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2021,627397,MA-07
"Public trust of artificial intelligence in the precision CDS health ecosystem Abstract Artificial intelligence-enhanced Clinical Decision Support (AI-CDS) is a growing multibillion-dollar industry leveraging a wide range of clinical, genomic, social, geographical, web-based, and wearable device data for improvements in health outcomes broadly circumscribed under the term “precision health.” Powered by Big Data, characterized by volume, velocity, veracity, variety, and value, “big knowledge” in the form of AI-CDS is becoming increasingly ubiquitous (volume), rapidly developing (velocity), available to a wide range of medical fields (variety), based on data from a wide range of sources that reflects the health of individuals and populations (veracity), and focused on lowering costs and promoting better health outcomes (value). Current policy paradigms for CDS, including whether to classify it as a medical device, are not designed for adaptive artificial intelligence technologies. Patients and providers have no reasonable way to discern how these “black box” technologies operate or their accuracy. Innovative policies (e.g. standards in product labeling) that address these concerns are likely to require direct consumer outreach and communications to ensure public trust in the growing AI-CDS field. Indeed, public trust in AI-CDS has been identified as a top priority for the AI- CDS big knowledge ecosystem by the National Academy of Medicine, NIH, FDA, and OMB, among others. Trust is particularly salient given the range of critical ethical and policy considerations related to transparency, privacy, non-maleficence, equity, accountability, and utility of AI-CDS. In Aim 1 of our proposed study, we will measure the public's current trust in AI-CDS for precision health and assess (a) its relationship to the public's expectations and concerns about privacy, equity, non-maleficence, responsibility, and utility and (b) how it may be affected by policies and practices, such as labeling or certification. In Aim 2 we will use deliberative democracy methods and expert interviews, designed to directly inform policy and standards that address perceived risks of AI-CDS and in Aim 3 we propose to develop a product information label that would both increase transparency and accessibility of information about AI-CDS for patients and providers. The continued acceptance and adoption of AI-CDS is predicated on public trust and our proposal provides a research-focused and evidence-based approach to incorporating public participation into emerging national standards. Project Narrative The goal of the proposed project is to address the gap in current research on public perspectives about ethical best practices and the impact of Artificial intelligence-enhanced Clinical Decision Support (AI-CDS) on the trust of the public. We propose to focus on policy and practice options such as certification, notification, and product labeling related to essential, endemic issues in the AI-CDS ecosystem: transparency, privacy, equity, non- maleficence, accountability, and utility (Aim 1 and Aim 2). For Aim 3, we evaluate key attributes for product labeling and an accompanying multi-dimensional metric of trust reflective of the Food and Drug Administration's system of categorizing software used as a medical device.",Public trust of artificial intelligence in the precision CDS health ecosystem,10092723,R01EB030492,"['Academy ', ' Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Attitude ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Certification ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Industry ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' Investments ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Medical Device ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Privatization ', ' Probability ', ' Product Labeling ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Participation ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' USFDA ', ' Universities ', ' Vendor ', ' Accountability ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Privacy ', ' United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' AHCPR ', ' AHRQ ', ' Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Competence ', ' Caring ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Policies ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' Notification ', ' Investigation ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' preference ', ' British ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' non-maleficence ', ' Nonmaleficence ', ' Melissa ', ' Malus domestica ', ' Apple ', ' Provider ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Security ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' point of care ', ' Health Professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' ethical legal social implication ', ' ELSI ', ' ethical, legal, and social ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' public trust ', ' deliberative democracy ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' data sharing ', ' Algorithmic Software ', ' Algorithmic Tools ', ' Software Algorithm ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' precision oncology ', ' individualized cancer care ', ' individualized oncology ', ' personalized oncology ', ' precision cancer care ', ' precision cancer medicine ', ' health data ', ' learning network ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' health management ', ' health care management ', ' healthcare management ', ' patient portal ', ' clinical decision support ', ' Precision Health ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' learning algorithm ', ' algorithm development ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,700766,MI-12
"Spectral precision imaging for early diagnosis of colorectal lesions with CT colonography Abstract Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths for men and women in the United States, even though it could be prevented by early detection and removal of its precursor lesions. Computed tomographic colonography (CTC) could substantially increase the capacity, safety, and patient compliance of colorectal examinations. However, the current standard of cathartic bowel preparation for CTC and optical colonoscopy (OC) is poorly tolerated by patients and has been recognized as a major barrier to colorectal examinations. Our advanced non-cathartic multi-center computer-assisted CTC trial showed that non-cathartic CTC is easily tolerated by patients and that radiologists who use computer-aided detection (CADe) can detect large polyps in size in non-cathartic CTC with high sensitivity, comparable to that of OC. However, SF6-lesions (serrated lesions, flat lesions <3 mm in height, and polyps 6 – 9 mm in size) were a significant source of false negatives in the trial. The challenges of detection and visualization of these SF6-lesions in non-cathartic CTC are caused largely by the inability of the current single-energy CTC technique to differentiate between soft tissues, fecal tagging, and their partial volumes with lumen air. We propose to employ multi-spectral CTC precision imaging and artificial intelligence (AI) to overcome these inherent limitations of non-cathartic CTC. Our goal in this project is to develop a novel deep-learning AI (DEEP-AI) scheme for multi-spectral multi-material (MUSMA) precision imaging, which will use deep super-learning of high-quality spectral CTC (spCTC) precision images to boost the diagnostic performance of non-cathartic CTC. We hypothesize that (1) high-quality MUSMA precision images can be reconstructed from ultra-low-dose (<1 mSv) spCTC scans, (2) DEEP-AI will yield a detection sensitivity for ≥6 mm SF6-lesions comparable to that of OC, and that (3) the use of DEEP-AI as first reader will significantly improve radiologists’ detection performance for SF6-lesions and reduce interpretation time compared with unaided reading, and that it will yield a detection accuracy comparable to that of OC. Our specific aims are (1) to establish a non-cathartic spCTC and MUSMA precision image database, (2) to develop a DEEP-AI Interpretation System for visualization and detection of SF6-lesions, and (3) to evaluate the clinical benefit of the DEEP-AI Interpretation System with non-cathartic spCTC cases. Successful development of the proposed DEEP-AI Interpretation System will substantially improve human readers’ performance in the detection of SF6-lesions from non-cathartic CTC examinations that address the problem of patient adherence to colorectal screening guidelines. Such a scheme will make non-cathartic CTC a highly accurate and acceptable screening option for large populations, leading to an increased colorectal screening rate, promoting early diagnosis of colon cancer, and ultimately reducing mortality due to colon cancer.

"Molecular guided surgery for enhanced resection of solid tumors ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to facilitate the candidate's transition to a role as a leading academic researcher and multidisciplinary team member developing optical fluorescence-based technology, with the goal of improving extent of tumor resection (EOTR) in brain cancer. In particular, a focus of this proposal is on advancing fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) within the context of neurosurgical oncology. To this end, the proposal outlines a mentored-training program with a strong clinical emphasis to compliment the candidate's proficiency in medical and optical imaging, placing the candidate within a critical mass of NIH-funded researchers at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC). The plan will focus on four complimentary areas: 1) providing a solid understanding of neurosurgical oncology, 2) developing an expertise in cancer molecular biology, 3) leading a pre-clinical investigation of molecular-guided cancer surgery, 4) expanding skills in optical engineering and machine learning, all of which will emphasize the synergy between understanding the clinical problems in neuro-oncology and advancing technology to address these problems. These goals are strongly supported by an experienced mentor team, led by neurosurgery section-chief Dr. Roberts, alongside NIH-funded researchers Profs. Paulsen, Pogue, and Hoopes. Leveraging the extensive opportunities at Dartmouth, the candidate will use K99 funding to devote time to graduate courses in cancer biology, medical imaging, and translational medicine, and to attend cancer workshops, training seminars, and CME-accredited Grand Rounds at the NCI Norris Cotton Cancer Center. The candidate will also attend AACR workshops to further strengthen clinical understanding of neuro-oncology, and provide a venue for presentation and feedback on the research work. The firm knowledge base gained by this training plan will be applied within the context of a pre-clinical research project to develop and evaluate a novel method of FGS- molecular-guided surgery (MGS) by means of intraoperative receptor concentration imaging (iRCI). The project will extend the rapidly growing field of FGS, applying a novel kinetic imaging approach to allow intraoperative evaluation of tumor-associated receptor expression, and to use this to guide surgical resection. Aim (1) will be to develop and test iRCI in a rat model of GBM, evaluating the accuracy of MGS to identify positive tissue and to improve EOTR compared with current FGS methods. Aim (2) will be to advance the current FGS camera systems, incorporating arterial input function measurement, and reducing absorption and scatter-based artifacts due to surface blood at the surgical site. Aim (3) will be to facilitate iRCI integrationinto the surgical workflow through strategic improvements in dye administration and AIF characterization. This proposal will expand the candidate's knowledge-base in cancer biology and surgical oncology, through extensive training opportunities and interactions with a strong multi-disciplinary team of mentors, equipping the candidate with all the necessary skills to accelerate the trajectory of his promising research career. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project will provide the candidate an opportunity to broaden cancer biology and neurosurgical oncology skills through a comprehensive training program, to supplement already advanced skills in neuroimaging. Molecular guided surgery, an intraoperative technique designed to improve the extent of tumor resection by providing contrast between healthy and malignant tissue based on expression of tumor-specific receptors, will be developed and evaluated in a rat orthotopic model of human glioma.",Molecular guided surgery for enhanced resection of solid tumors,10140127,R00CA190890,"['absorption ', ' Accreditation ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Volume ', ' Calibration ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Contrast Media ', ' Contrast Agent ', ' Contrast Drugs ', ' Radiopaque Media ', ' Dyes ', ' Coloring Agents ', ' Engineering ', ' Exhibits ', ' Feedback ', ' Fluorescence ', ' Glioma ', ' Glial Cell Tumors ', ' Glial Neoplasm ', ' Glial Tumor ', ' Neuroglial Neoplasm ', ' Neuroglial Tumor ', ' glial-derived tumor ', ' neuroglia neoplasm ', ' neuroglia tumor ', ' Goals ', ' Horns ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Kinetics ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Mentors ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methods ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' neurosurgery ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Permeability ', ' Nude Rats ', ' Athymic Rats ', ' Rattus ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rat ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ', ' EGF Receptor ', ' EGFR ', ' ERBB Protein ', ' Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Kinase ', ' Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinase ', ' Epidermal Growth Factor-Urogastrone Receptors ', ' HER1 ', ' TGF-alpha Receptor ', ' Transforming Growth Factor alpha Receptor ', ' Urogastrone Receptor ', ' c-erbB-1 ', ' c-erbB-1 Protein ', ' erbB-1 ', ' erbB-1 Proto-Oncogene Protein ', ' erbBl ', ' proto-oncogene protein c-erbB-1 ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Shoes ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Spatial Distribution ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Training Programs ', ' Work ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Sodium Fluorescein ', ' Disodium Fluorescein ', ' Fluorescein Disodium Salt ', ' Uranine ', ' Malignant neoplasm of brain ', ' Brain Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Brain ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant -

"Microdata for Analysis of Early Life Conditions, Health, and Population Project Summary This project will enhance and develop the only source of data that provides core information about work, education, income, and migration for the entire U.S. population. This unique resource allows us to observe today's late-life population when they were young. This allows a prospective view of the impact of early-life environments and socioeconomic status on health and well-being in later life. The massive database describes the characteristics of all 133 million persons who resided in the United States in 1940. The data have been available for only a brief period, but are already having a profound impact on scientific research. They are the primary data source for at least 19 sponsored projects, including nine funded by NIH and seven funded by NSF. Through May 2017, 104 investigators had produced 95 papers based on the data, including 22 articles, four books, three PhD dissertations, and 66 working papers. This project will improve the quality and usability of the database by correcting transcription errors; improving the coding, editing, and allocation of key variables; and introducing new data dissemination tools designed to simplify access to the data. The project will undertake three major activities to meet these objectives. 1. Incorporate new verified census information on name, age, sex, family relationship, race, marital status,  birthplace, and residence five years ago. 2. Improve coding, editing, and allocation for geographic variables, migration, occupation, and numerically-  coded variables such as income. 3. Apply new technologies to democratize access to the data through new data access tools and a virtual data  enclave for a restricted version of the data that contains names. This project is a highly cost-effective use of scarce resources to develop shared infrastructure for research, education, and policy-making on health and aging. The proposed improvement of data quality is urgent, and will provide a resource of unprecedented power for understanding the effects of public policies, social institutions, and environmental conditions on the health, well-being, and functioning of people, both over the life course and in their later years.

The proposed work is directly relevant to the core mission of the Population and Social Processes branch of NIA, since the data will allow us to observe today's late-life population when they were young.","Microdata for Analysis of Early Life Conditions, Health, and Population",10138934,R01AG041831,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Books ', ' Censuses ', ' Data Sources ', ' Demography ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Family Relationship ', ' Family Relations ', ' Future ', ' Genealogy ', ' Geneologies ', ' Geography ', ' Handwriting ', ' Health ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Investments ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Marital Status ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Persons ', ' Names ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Paper ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Policy Making ', ' Privatization ', ' Public Policy ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Science ', ' Sociology ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Arbitration ', ' Arbitrating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' residence ', ' residential building ', ' residential site ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' data quality ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' tool ', ' Church of Latter-day Saints ', ' Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Occupational ', ' American ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' social ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Institution ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Population-Level Process ', ' Population Process ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' blind ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' migration ', ' usability ', ' arm ', ' Social Processes ', ' data access ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' data dissemination ', ' data enclave ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2021,551550,MN-05
"Public Insurance Design and Health at Older Ages PROJECT ABSTRACT Health insurance has been at the forefront of US public policy debate throughout the last decade. For elderly Americans, who benefit from nearly universal coverage under Medicare, decisions about the scope of their insurance coverage have been a central policy concern since Medicare’s inception in 1965. Medicare’s coverage is extensive, but by statute the program only covers medical services that are “reasonable and necessary,” which can be a controversial definition. Some decisions about what Medicare should cover have engendered intense debate, underscoring the importance of the program’s coverage decisions for millions of patients and doctors. The debate around the scope of Medicare coverage is likely to intensify in the coming decades as options for medical treatment, and testing, expand rapidly, the population ages, and public insurance systems grapple with how to address inequality in access to medical innovations. Yet, despite the importance of decisions about the scope of insurance coverage in and outside of Medicare, we know little about how the scope of coverage (as opposed to patient cost-sharing), affects treatment choices, clinical practice, and health outcomes for the elderly. The research outlined in this proposal aims to start filling this gap. The project investigates how the presence or lack of insurance coverage for specific procedural or pharmacologic therapies affects treatment decisions and health outcomes for the elderly with Alzheimer’s Disease and related Dementias (ADRD). This is a population that may be particularly vulnerable to changes and limits in insurance coverage, as the patients may have limited decision-making capacity and may be disproportionately exposed to treatments that are deemed experimental and lacking effectiveness to clear the “reasonable and necessary” threshold. Aim 1 of the project is to estimate the average effect of coverage decisions across prescription drugs and outpatient procedures on treatment decisions and health outcomes of elderly Medicare enrollees with ADRD. Aim 2 is to predict and characterize the subgroups of ADRD patients that are most likely to be affected by decisions that restrict the scope of insurance coverage using machine learning methods. The proposed empirical method is to use quasi- experimental variation that arises from natural experiments of abrupt changes in insurance coverage within different parts of the Medicare program. The analysis takes advantage of variation in the scope of formularies across Medicare Part D plans, as well as the variation in local coverage decisions for physician services and outpatient procedures under Medicare Part B. These sources of variation coupled with methods for quasi- experimental estimation of treatment effects and machine learning methods for heterogeneity analyses, allow estimating the response of treatment decisions and health of the elderly with ADRD across different drugs, procedures, and subgroups of ADRD patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE For elderly Americans, who benefit from nearly universal coverage under Medicare, decisions about the scope of their insurance coverage have been a central policy concern since Medicare’s inception in 1965 - Medicare’s coverage is extensive, but nevertheless incomplete as by statute the program only covers medical services that are “reasonable and necessary,” which can be hard to define. The debate around the scope of Medicare coverage is likely to intensify in the coming decades as options for medical treatment, and testing, expand rapidly, the population ages, and public insurance systems grapple with how to address inequality in access to medical innovations. In this project I investigate how changes in coverage for prescription drugs, physician office visits, and outpatient procedures affect the treatment received by elderly patients with Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD), who often face coverage limitations due to experimental nature of many ADRD treatments, and yet may be most vulnerable to unintended consequences of any coverage

"Carolina Population Center PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Carolina Population Center requests infrastructure support that will advance population dynamics research at CPC by increasing research impact, innovation, and productivity, supporting the development of junior scientists, and reducing the administrative burden on scientists. Infrastructure support will advance science in three primary research areas: Sexuality, Reproduction, Fertility, and Families; Population, Health, and the Environment; and Inequality, Mobility, Disparities, and Well-Being. Much of the research at CPC draws on large publicly available longitudinal data sets that our faculty have designed and collected, including the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, the China Health and Nutrition Survey, newer surveys associated with the Transfer Project, and the Study of the Tsunami Aftermath and Recovery, all of which will continue to be important in work related to our primary research areas over the next five years. These projects embody several themes that have guided research at CPC since the Center's inception. These themes, which will continue to shape our work, are the importance of life course processes and longitudinal data, multi-level processes and measurement of context, interventions and natural experiments as means of learning about causal processes, and the relevance of sociodemographic variables such as age, gender, race- ethnicity, and socioeconomic status for disparities in health and well-being. By embedding these themes, our projects provide data that enable us to address barriers that otherwise impede progress in the population sciences generally, and in our primary research areas in particular. We request support for three cores which in combination will provide an institutional infrastructure that will push populations dynamics research forward by empowering CPC faculty to tackle challenging questions using state of the art measurement techniques and methods. The Administrative Core plans activities that maintain a stimulating intellectual community, streamlines administrative processes so that scientists can focus on research, coordinates activities of the Cores so that services are offered efficiently, and communicates information about research and data more broadly. The Development Core supports early stage investigators and other faculty with exciting new ideas through multiple mechanisms: workshops, access to technical expertise in measurement, and seed grants. The Research Services Core enables scientists to address complex and important population research issues by providing access to state-of-the-art research tools and professional support for programming, survey development, and analysis. NARRATIVE This project will provide infrastructure support for a cutting edge program of research on population dynamics at the Carolina Population Center. Research at the Center will analyze state-of-the art data to address fundamental questions regarding fertility, adolescent health, and links between the environment and health.

"Distinguishing normal aging from age-related macular degeneration at the level of single cells int eh living human eye Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly in the developed world; no cure exists and prevalence is rising rapidly. Because only primates have a macula and since no model of AMD exists in non-human primates, the disease course can only be elucidated through in-depth study of humans. Blindness in AMD is caused by progressive and irreversible death of rod and cone photoreceptors secondary to degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) that is essential for their health and function. Clinical imaging and histology have informed us greatly about the later stages of disease but fundamental knowledge to understand how AMD diverges from normal aging at onset is lacking. With advanced adaptive optics ophthalmoscopy (AOO) imaging methods, combined with clinical imaging and visual function testing, we will characterize healthy human retinal aging in cross-sectional study, by defining the in vivo RPE-photoreceptor cellular organization and microscopic autofluorescence variation with age and wavelength. This will produce the largest quantitative in vivo normative dataset of AOO cell-based metrics to date and we will use this data to generate new quantitative analysis tools needed to evaluate emerging therapies designed to prevent or slow vision loss in AMD (Aim 1). In a case-control study, we will then compare normal photoreceptor topography and RPE cell morphometry to clinically defined early AMD to quantitatively define the earliest cellular changes in AMD that can be detected in vivo. This work will identify the cellular alterations and phenotypes that differentiate normal aging from early AMD to facilitate early onset detection. These results will be contextualized by comparison to tissue-level alterations seen with aging and early AMD in clinical imaging, specifically choriocapillaris decline and drusen (Aim 2). The results of this study will result in a paradigm shift from the use of clinical diagnosis and classification systems for AMD that rely solely on tissue- level biomarkers or traditional funduscopic clinical signs to those that rely on rigorous quantitative in vivo cell- based metrics. Together, this knowledge and these tools will lay the foundation needed to develop and evaluate new preventative therapies that are needed to limit or prevent vision loss in AMD. Project Narrative Age-related macular degeneration is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly in the US and is a significant public health issue that is projected to worsen due to the rapidly aging population. Here we aim to understand how retinal cells change in normal aging and how these normal age-related changes differ from the changes that lead to age-related macular degeneration. This project will allow us to detect age-related macular degeneration earlier and will produce new tools to monitor retinal cells that will facilitate the development and testing of preventative therapies to slow or prevent vision loss in age-related macular degeneration.",Distinguishing normal aging from age-related macular degeneration at the level of single cells int eh living human eye,10172913,R01EY030517,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Choroid ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cytoplasmic Granules ', ' granule ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Histology ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lipofuscin ', ' Maps ', ' Melanins ', ' Methods ', ' Ophthalmoscopy ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Perfusion ', ' Phenotype ', ' Photoreceptors ', ' Photoreceptor Cell ', ' Photosensitive Cell ', ' Visual Receptor ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Public Health ', ' Retina ', ' Retinal Degeneration ', ' degenerative retina diseases ', ' retina degeneration ', ' retinal degenerative ', ' retinal degenerative diseases ', ' Structure of retinal pigment epithelium ', ' Outer pigmented layer of retina ', ' Pigment cell layer of retina ', ' Pigmented layer of retina ', ' Retinal Pigment Epithelium ', ' Retinal pigment epithelial cells ', ' Risk ', ' Spatial Distribution ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', "" Bruch's basal membrane structure "", ' Bruch Membrane ', "" Bruch's membrane "", ' Bruchs membrane ', ' Lamina Basalis Choroideae ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Secondary to ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' morphometry ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Microscopic ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' retinal rods ', ' Rod Photoreceptors ', ' rod cell ', ' Retinal Cone ', ' Cone Photoreceptors ', ' cone cell ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' Age related macular degeneration ', ' Age-Related Maculopathy ', ' age related macular dystrophy ', ' senile macular disease ', ' Primate Diseases ', ' Genetic ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Atrophy ', ' Atrophic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Retinal Photoreceptors ', ' Rods and Cones ', ' Vertebrate Photoreceptors ', ' Knowledge ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' fluorophore ', ' cohort ', ' Histopathology ', ' Structure ', ' Modeling ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' Druse ', ' Drusen ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Therapy Evaluation ', ' in vivo ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' early onset ', ' restorative treatment ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' neurovascular unit ', ' neuro-vascular unit ', ' macula ', ' macular ', ' Prevalence ', ' normal aging ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' adaptive optics ', ' aging population ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' healthy aging ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' imaging platform ', ' Preventive treatment ', ' Preventative treatment ', ' Preventive therapy ', ' Preventative therapy ', ' clinical imaging ', ' retinal imaging ', ' retina imaging ', ' ']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,524330,PA-18
"Contextualized daily prediction of lapse risk in opioid use disorder by digital phenotyping PROJECT SUMMARY Opioid use disorder is increasingly widespread, leading to devastating consequences and costs for patients and their families, friends, and communities. Available treatments for opioid and other substance use disorders (SUD) are not successful at sustaining sobriety. The vast majority of people with SUD relapse within a year. Critically, they often fail to detect dynamic, day-by-day changes in their risk for relapse and do not adequately employ skills they developed or take advantage of support available through continuing care. The broad goals of this project are to develop and deliver a highly contextualized, lapse risk prediction models for forecasting day-by-day probability of opioid and other drug use lapse among people pursuing drug abstinence. This lapse risk prediction model will be delivered within the Addiction-Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (A-CHESS) mobile app, which has been established by RCT as a state-of-the-art mHealth system for providing continuing care services for alcohol and substance use disorders. To accomplish these broad goals, a diverse sample of 480 participants with opioid use disorder who are pursing abstinence will be recruited. These participants will be followed for 12 months of their recovery, with observations occurring as early as one week post-abstinence and as late as 18 months post-abstinence across participants in the sample. Well-established distal, static relapse risk signals (e.g., addiction severity, comorbid psychopathology) will be measured on intake. A range of more proximal, time-varying opioid (and other drug use) lapse risk signals will also be collected via participants’ smartphones. These signals include self-report surveys every two months, daily ecological momentary assessments, daily video recovery “check-ins”, voice phone call and text message logs, text message content, moment-by-moment location (via smartphone GPS and location services), physical activity (via smartphone sensors), and usage of the mobile A-CHESS Recovery Support app. The predictive power of these risk signals will be further increased by anchoring them within an inter-personal context of known people, locations, dates, and times that support or detract from participants’ abstinence efforts. Machine learning methods will be used to train, validate, and test opioid (and other drug) lapse risk prediction models based on these contextualized static and dynamic risk signals. These lapse risk prediction models will provide participant specific, day-by-day probabilistic forecast of a lapse to opioid (or other drug) use among opioid abstinent individuals. These lapse risk prediction models will be formally added to the A-CHESS continuing care mobile app at the completion of the project for use in clinical care. These project goals position A-CHESS to make relapse prevention and recovery support, information, and risk monitoring available to patients continuously. Compared to conventional continuing care, A-CHESS will provide personalized care and be available and implemented during moments of greatest need. Integrated real-time risk prediction holds substantial promise to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of these continuing care services. PROJECT NARRATIVE The project’s goals are to develop and deliver a real-time model for forecasting day-by-day opioid use lapse among abstinent patients with opioid use disorder.

"Modeling the Incompleteness and Biases of Health Data Modeling the Incompleteness and Biases of Health Data Researchers are increasingly working to “mine” health data to derive new medical knowledge. Unlike experimental data that are collected per a research protocol, the primary role of clinical data is to help clinicians care for patients, so the procedures for its collection are not often systematic. Thus, missing and/or biased data can hinder medical knowledge discovery and data mining efforts. Existing efforts for missing health data imputation often focus on only cross-sectional correlation (e.g., correlation across subjects or across variables) but neglect autocorrelation (e.g., correlation across time points). Moreover, they often focus on modeling incompleteness but neglect the biases in health data. Modeling both the incompleteness and bias may contribute to better understanding of health data and better support clinical decision making. We propose a novel framework of Bias-Aware Missing data Imputation with Cross-sectional correlation and Autocorrelation (BAMICA), and leverage clinical notes to better inform the methods that will otherwise rely on structured health data only. In addition to evaluating its imputation accuracy, we will apply the proposed framework to assist in downstream tasks such as predictive modeling for multiple outcomes across a diverse range of clinical and cohort study datasets. Aim 1 introduces the MICA framework to jointly consider cross-sectional correlation and auto-correlation. In Aim 2, we will augment MICA to be bias-aware (hence BAMICA) to account for biases stemmed from multiple roots such as healthcare process and use them as features in imputing missing health data. This augmentation is achieved by a novel recurrent neural network architecture that keeps track of both evolution of health data variables and bias factors. In Aim 3, we will supplement unstructured clinical notes to structured health data for modeling incompleteness and biases using a novel architecture of graph neural network on top of memory network. We will apply graph neural networks to process clinical notes in order to learn proper representations as input to the memory networks for imputation and downstream predictive modeling tasks. Depending on the clinical problem and data availability, not all modules may be needed. Thus our proposed BAMICA framework is designed to be flexible and consists of selectable modules to meet some or all of the above needs. In summary, our proposal bridges a key knowledge gap in jointly modeling incompleteness and biases in health data and utilizes unstructured clinical notes to supplement and augment such modeling in order to better support predictive modeling and clinical decision making. We will demonstrate generalizability by experimenting on four large clinical and cohort study datasets, and by scaling up to the eMERGE network spanning 11 institutions nationwide. We will disseminate the open-source framework. The principled and flexible framework generated by this project will bring significant methodological advancement and have a direct impact on enhancing discovery from health data.

In addition to evaluating its imputation accuracy, we will apply the proposed framework to assist in downstream tasks such as predictive modeling for multiple outcomes across a diverse range of clinical and cohort study datasets.",Modeling the Incompleteness and Biases of Health Data,10168611,R01LM013337,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Awareness ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Critical Care ', ' Data Collection ', ' Evolution ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Hospitals ', ' General Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Schedule ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Intuition ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' data quality ', ' Measurement ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hour ', ' Dependence ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' Test Result ', ' Performance ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' Modeling ', ' discovery mining ', ' literature mining ', ' literature searching ', ' text mining ', ' text searching ', ' Institution ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Collection ', ' lifetime risk ', ' life-time risk ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Derivation procedure ', ' Derivation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' neglect ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' open source ', ' stem ', ' patient population ', ' social health determinants ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Regimen ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' Knowledge Discovery ', ' personalized diagnostics ', ' personalized diagnosis ', ' precise diagnostics ', ' precision diagnostics ', ' personalized therapeutic ', ' health data ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' clinical decision support ', ' Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network ', ' eMERGE Consortium ', ' eMERGE Network ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' neural network ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' neural network architecture ', ' neural net architecture ', ' structured data ', ' ']",NLM,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,315727,IL-07
"Temporal relation discovery for clinical text Project Summary / Abstract The current proposal continues the investigation on the topic of temporal relation extraction from the Electronic Medical Records (EMR) clinical narrative funded by the NLM since 2010 (Temporal Histories of Your Medical Events, or THYME; thyme.healthnlp.org). Through our efforts so far, we have defined the topic as an active area of research attracting attention across the world. Since its inception, the project has pushed the boundaries of this highly challenging task by investigating new computational methods within the context of the latest developments in the fields of natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI) and biomedical informatics (BMI) resulting in 60+ publications/presentations. We have made our best performing methods available to the community open source as part of the Apache Clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES; ctakes.apache.org). In 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, we organized an international shared task (Clinical TempEval) on the topic under the umbrella of the highly prestigious SemEval, thus inviting the international community to work with our THYME data and improve on our results. Clinical TempEval has been highly successful with many participants each year, resulting in new discoveries and many publications. We have made all our data along with our gold standard annotations available to the community through the hNLP Center (center.healthnlp.org).  The underlying theme of this renewal is novel methods for combining explicit domain knowledge (linguistic, semantic, biomedical ontological, clinical), readily available unlabeled data (health-related social media, EMRs), and modern machine learning techniques (e.g. neural networks) for temporal relation extraction from the EMR clinical narrative. Therefore, our renewal proposes a novel and much needed exploration of this line of research:  Specific Aim 1: Develop computational models for novel rich semantic representations such as the Abstract Meaning Representations to encapsulate a single, coherent, full-document graphical representation of meaning for temporal relation extraction  Specific Aim 2: Develop computational methods to infuse domain knowledge (linguistic, semantic, biomedical ontological, clinical) into modern machine learning techniques such as NNs for temporal relation extraction – through input representations, pre-trained vectors, or architectures  Specific Aim 3: Develop novel methods for combining labeled and unlabeled data from various sources (EMR, health-related social media, newswire) for temporal relation extraction from the clinical narrative  Specific Aim 4: Apply the best performing methods for temporal relation extraction developed in SA1-3 to temporally sensitive phenotypes for direct translational sciences studies. Dissemination efforts through publications and open source releases into Apache cTAKES. Project Narrative Temporal relations are of prime importance in biomedicine as they are intrinsically linked to diseases, signs and symptoms, and treatments. Understanding the timeline of clinically relevant events is key to the next generation of translational research where the importance of generalizing over large amounts of data holds the promise of deciphering biomedical puzzles. The goal of our current proposal is to automatically discover temporal relations from clinical free text and structured EMR data and create an aggregated patient-level timeline.",Temporal relation discovery for clinical text,10176589,R01LM010090,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Attention ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Semantics ', ' Signs and Symptoms ', ' Diagnostic Findings ', ' Thyme ', ' Thymus vulgaris ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' TimeLine ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Encapsulated ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' cohesion ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' advanced illness ', ' advanced disease ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Cognitive ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' electronic data ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' vector ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' biomed informatics ', ' Knowledge Extraction ', ' next generation ', ' Coupled ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' open source ', ' electronic structure ', ' biomedical ontology ', ' individualized medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapeutic strategy ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' learning community ', ' social media ', ' symptom treatment ', ' symptomatic treatment ', ' treat symptom ', ' Apache ', ' neural network ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' support vector machine ', ' ']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,531398,MA-07
"A Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel for Aging Research Summary/Abstract This project will construct a Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel (IPUMS-MLP) of unprecedented scale and scope. Using cutting-edge automatic record linkage technology and drawing on complete count U.S. census data available from IPUMS for the period 1850 to 1940, the project will construct millions of individual life histories and trace millions of families over multiple generations. This infrastructure will provide the most comprehensive view of long-run changes in life-course dynamics available for any place in the world and will transform our understanding of processes of population aging. The work will require significant innovation and new technical infrastructure to accommodate the massive scale of the database. These data will allow investigators to directly observe changes in aging processes and life-course transitions during the period in which U.S. society was being transformed by industrialization, urbanization, immigration, demographic transition, and economic collapse. Investigators will be able to follow individuals over time to evaluate the impact of early-life conditions on later outcomes, trace life-course transitions into adulthood and old age, and observe family change over multiple generations. IPUMS-MLP will enrich existing aging surveys by providing data on multiple generations of forebears of survey respondents; likewise, it will enrich existing historical databases by enabling them to connect with descendants across multiple generations. Leveraging billions of dollars of federal investments in census data and transactional records from a variety of administrative sources, this project is a highly cost-effective use of scarce resources to develop shared infrastructure for research, education, and policy-making on health and aging. Project Narrative The proposed work is directly relevant to the core mission of the Population and Social Processes branch of NIA: the new data will advance fundamental knowledge about the causes and consequences of changes in health and well-being of the older population and will support research on the effects of public policies, social institutions, and environmental conditions on the health, well-being, and functioning of people, both over the life course and in their later years. For example, the data will enable examinations of the impact of lead exposure to late onset Alzheimer’s disease, the socioeconomic and health effects of early-life income support, intergenerational transmission of health and wellbeing over multiple generations, and the impact of early-life cognitive capacity on later-life health and economic outcomes.",A Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel for Aging Research,10174657,R01AG057679,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' Demographic Transitions ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Genealogy ', ' Geneologies ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Immigration ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Industrialization ', ' Investments ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Methods ', ' Military Personnel ', ' Armed Forces Personnel ', ' Military ', ' military population ', ' Mission ', ' Persons ', ' Names ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Policy Making ', ' Public Policy ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Running ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Social Security ', ' Social Insurance ', ' Societies ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Urbanization ', ' War ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Data Security ', ' Data awareness ', ' information security ', ' Family member ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' data quality ', ' Respondent ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Source ', ' late onset alzheimer ', ' Late Onset Alzheimer Disease ', ' experience ', ' 65+ years old ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' old age ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' parallel processing ', ' intergenerational ', ' life history ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' Institution ', ' Data ', ' Population-Level Process ', ' Population Process ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Older Population ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' health economics ', ' data integration ', ' lead exposure ', ' Exposure to Pb2+ ', ' Pb exposed ', ' Pb exposure ', ' Pb2+ Exposure ', ' Pb2+ exposed ', ' exposed to lead ', ' exposure to Pb ', ' exposure to lead ', ' lead exposed ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' economic outcome ', ' aging population ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' Social Processes ', ' cognitive capacity ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' Infrastructure ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' data curation ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2021,672964,MN-05
"Building a reinforcement learning tool for individually tailoring just-in-time adaptive interventions: Extending the reach of mHealth technology for improved weight loss outcomes Project Summary Excess weight is associated with 13 types of cancer. These cancers disproportionately affect Black and Latinx individuals, as well as those with lower socioeconomic status, because overweight and obesity incidence is higher in these groups. Behavioral weight loss interventions are effective, but in-person interventions tend to have low reach. As mobile phone ownership is increasing in the United States, mHealth technology holds promise for reaching a larger population than in-person behavioral interventions. Furthermore, because they travel with individuals and can collect digital information in real-time, mHealth tools make it possible to intervene with individuals at the precise point when the interventions are needed with just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs). As currently implemented, mHealth JITAIs are adaptive in the sense that interventionists can specify decision rules a priori that result in intervention messages that are triggered or tailored by certain events. These experimenter-specified decision rules are generally based upon results of prior studies, specifically micro-randomized trials that provide sequential tests of mHealth intervention messages in order to determine causal effects of messages conditional on user context. However, JITAIs that are developed in this manner cannot be truly individually tailored because the same decision rules are equally applied to everybody without regard to information about how individuals actually respond to intervention messages. Rapidly evolving machine learning methods, specifically reinforcement learning (RL), makes it possible to improve upon the current approach to JITAIs by learning each person's unique response patterns and integrating this information into subsequent, person-specific, adaptive decision rules. However, the few behavioral interventionists who have created mHealth JITAIs for weight loss using RL have noted high practical barriers to doing so because implementation of RL requires specialized expertise and can be labor intensive. The field needs a user-friendly tool to reduce these barriers in order for RL methodology to become widely adopted. Aim 1 is to develop Adapt, a tool that iteratively integrates real-time data, applies RL algorithms, and performs micro-randomized trials to optimize JITAI decision rules for weight loss. Adapt will pull in digital health data in real-time and conduct micro-randomized trials using behavioral patterns and outcomes to arrive at the most efficacious intervention message, delivered at the right time, for promoting weight loss in each participant. Aim 2 is to conduct a 12-week pilot feasibility study testing usability of Adapt in a weight loss intervention (NudgeRL). NudgeRL will build upon the team's existing JITAI, Nudge, which did not incorporate RL. The sample will consist of 20 adults with overweight or obesity, at least 50% of whom are Black or Latinx. Although Adapt will be developed to improve weight loss interventions, its widespread use will result in more efficient and efficacious JITAIs across a broad range of health outcomes, resulting in a lower burden of cancer and other disease due to a wide spectrum of improved health behaviors. Project Narrative The objective of this project is to develop a tool that will make it easier for behavioral interventionists to implement reinforcement learning, a type of machine learning, into adaptive mobile (mHealth) interventions, specifically those intended to promote weight control. Widespread use of this tool will result in more efficient and effective adaptive mHealth interventions, ultimately leading to a lower burden of obesity-linked disease, including cancer.",Building a reinforcement learning tool for individually tailoring just-in-time adaptive interventions: Extending the reach of mHealth technology for improved weight loss outcomes,10195835,R21CA260092,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Incidence ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Ownership ', ' Positive Reinforcements ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' United States ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' body weight loss ', ' wt-loss ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' African American ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' Hispanics ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Link ', ' Physical activity ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' cancer prevention ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' behavior change ', ' Participant ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' weight control ', ' weight management ', ' Weight maintenance regimen ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' time use ', ' digital ', ' Outcome ', ' Obesity associated disease ', ' Obesity related disease ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer-related health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' weight loss intervention ', ' weight loss therapy ', ' weight loss treatment ', ' obesity risk ', ' risk for obesity ', ' risk of obesity ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' user-friendly ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' ethnoracial ', ' usability ', ' effective intervention ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' health data ', ' fitbit ', ' web-based tool ', ' adaptive intervention ', ' learning algorithm ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' digital health ', ' efficacious intervention ', ' Latinx ', ' ']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2021,410893,NC-04

"Tracking the dynamics of how schemas scaffold recall Project Summary Every new experience in our life takes place within the context of familiar environments and situations. However, most research on memory has focused on the artificial memorization of word lists, symbols or pictures; these studies do not meaningfully address how structured prior knowledge about the world (e.g., in the form of a familiar spatial map, or knowledge of how restaurant meals unfold over time) can scaffold new learning. In the proposed studies, I aim to precisely characterize how and where prior knowledge and new information are represented, how they get linked at encoding, and how they interact at recall to allow memories to be retrieved. In the first proposed study of my F99 phase, I test the hypothesis that hippocampal engagement at event boundaries during learning binds new information (i.e. objects) to the scaffold of existing knowledge (i.e. knowledge of a familiar location), and that hippocampal activation during recall mediates the successful retrieval of the bound object from the location in which it was stored. I also test the hypothesis that distinctive representations of spatial locations in the brain will reduce interference between objects stored in those locations. There is a potential downside to using prior knowledge as a scaffold: When there is too much information attached to one part of the scaffold, old and new memories will interfere with each other. How, then, could someone prioritize the retrieval of new memories over older (now-irrelevant) memories that were linked to the scaffold? Recent research on intentional forgetting suggests a solution to this limitation. Specifically, in my second proposed study, I test the hypothesis (supported by neurophysiological evidence, prior neuroimaging results, and computational models) that previously encoded memories can be weakened by moderately activating their neural representation, thereby “cleaning” the scaffold and reducing interference. In the K00 phase, I will extend my research to identify pathologies in how clinical populations use prior knowledge to interpret and remember their experiences, using tools from computational psychiatry; I also plan to design new technological tools to address these issues. Overall, the proposed project makes use of naturalistic and ecologically valid stimuli (in the form of continuous stimuli and immersive virtual reality) paired with advanced machine learning tools applied to brain imaging data, to study the fundamental nature of how new and old information are linked to allow learning. In the long-term, the findings from this project regarding how prior knowledge can be optimally leveraged to support new learning will lead to the development of tools to help memory-impaired individuals make better use of prior knowledge to support new learning, as well as remedies for groups where deficiencies in prior knowledge prevent them from learning properly. Project Narrative In my dissertation, I will use newly-developed machine learning techniques to study how the brain uses prior knowledge (about the spatial structure of an environment, or how certain types of events unfold in time) to scaffold new learning. By precisely characterizing how this scaffolding process works, my research will help to identify ways in which prior knowledge can be more optimally leveraged to support learning. This will lead to the development of tools to help memory-impaired individuals make better use of intact prior knowledge to support new learning, as well as remedies for groups where deficiencies in prior knowledge prevent them from learning properly.",Tracking the dynamics of how schemas scaffold recall,10156352,F99NS120644,"['Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cues ', ' Environment ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Maps ', ' Memory ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Pathology ', ' Perception ', ' Play ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Research ', ' Restaurants ', ' Self-Help Devices ', ' Assistive Technology ', ' assisted device ', ' assistive device ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' tool ', ' scaffolding ', ' scaffold ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' experience ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' Performance ', ' forgetting ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' memory retrieval ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Participant ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' virtual reality ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Institution ', ' Brain region ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Retrieval ', ' Cognitive ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' virtual ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' memory encoding ', ' tool development ', ' phase 1 testing ', ' phase 1 evaluation ', ' phase I evaluation ', ' phase I testing ', ' virtual reality environment ', ' immersive digital environment ', ' immersive environment ', ' immersive virtual environment ', ' immersive virtual reality ', ' virtual world ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NINDS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,F99,2021,47036,NJ-12
"A computer vision toolbox for computational analysis of nonverbal social communication PROJECT SUMMARY We will develop novel computer vision tools to reliably and precisely measure nonverbal social communication through quantifying communicative facial and bodily expressions. Our tools will be designed and developed in order to maximize their usability by non-engineer behavioral scientists, filling the enormous gap between engineering advances and their clinical accessibility. Significance: Social interaction inherently relies on perception and production of coordinated face and body expressions. Indeed, atypical face and body movements are observed in many disorders, impacting social interaction and communication. Traditional systems for quantifying nonverbal communication (e.g., FACS, BAP) require extensive training and coding time. Their tedious coding requirements drastically limits their scalability and reproducibility. While an extensive literature exists on advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques for face and body analysis, there is no well-established method commonly used in mental health community to quantify production of facial and bodily expressions or efficiently capture individual differences in nonverbal communication in general. As a part of this proposal, we will develop a computer vision toolbox including tools that are both highly granular and highly scalable, to allow for measurement of complex social behavior in large and heterogeneous populations. Approach: Our team will develop tools that provide granular metrics of nonverbal social behavior, including localized face and body kinematics, characteristics of elicited expressions, and imitation performance. Our tools will facilitate measurement of social communication both within a person and between people, to allow for assessment of individual social communication cues as well as those that occur within bidirectional social contexts. Preliminary Data: We have developed and applied novel computer vision tools to assess: (1) diversity of mouth motion during conversational speech (effect size d=1.0 in differentiating young adults with and without autism during a brief natural conversation), (2) interpersonal facial coordination (91% accuracy in classifying autism diagnosis in young adults during a brief natural conversation, replicated in an independent child sample), and (3) body action imitation (85% accuracy in classifying autism diagnosis based on body imitation performance). As apart of current proposal, we will develop more generic methods that can be used in normative and clinical samples. Aims. In Aim 1, we will develop tools to automatically quantify fine-grained face movements and their coordination during facial expression production; in Aim 2, we will develop tools to quantify body joint kinematics and their coordination during bodily expression production; in Aim 3, we will demonstrate the tools’ ability to yield dimensional metrics using machine learning. Impact: Our approach is designed for fast and rigorous assessment of nonverbal social communication, providing a scalable solution to measure individual variability, within a dimensional and transdiagnostic framework.

"Empower treatment effects evaluation of randomized clinical trials for elderly patients with integrated real-world data PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are the gold-standard method of evaluating cancer treatment, which has immense health and economic burdens worldwide. However, practical considerations that allow an RCT to be conducted typically require a relatively small sample size and restricted eligibility criteria such that the study has inadequate power to generalize treatment effects to elderly patients or other under-represented patient pop- ulations. On the other hand, massive real-world data (RWD) are increasingly captured by population-based databases and registries, such as Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER), SEER-Medicare, and National Cancer Database (NCDB), that have much broader demographic and clinical diversity compared to RCT cohorts. Treatment evaluation using causal inference methods and RWD that were not collected purely for re- search purposes is now frequently performed but fraught with limitations such as confounding due to lack of randomization. In fact, the agreement between RCT and RWD ﬁndings is often low in the analysis of matched RCT and RWD studies with the same treatment comparisons. Although several national organizations and reg- ulatory agencies have advocated using RWD to complement RCTs, methods that integrate these two potentially complementary data sources and achieve better treatment evaluation over the use of a single data source alone have yet to be developed.  This proposal is motivated by the PIs' collaborative work to study the safety and efﬁcacy of treatment strategies for elderly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and esophageal cancer patients by integrating data from multiple sources: RCTs from NCI cooperative groups and the real-world databases (e.g. SEER, SEER-Medicare, and NCDB). The objective of this project is to develop new statistical methods for integrative analyses of RCTs and RWD that can improve the generalizability and increase estimation efﬁciency of RCT ﬁndings to more diverse ""real-world"" patients as well as under-studied populations while avoiding confounding bias inherent in RWD. In Aim 1, we develop methods for statistical analysis of RCT data to compare chemoradiotherapy patterns for the real-world and elderly NSCLC patients by leveraging the baseline covariates of comparable patients from SEER, for whom the temporal information of chemotherapy and radiation and the outcome are both missing. Aims 2 and 3 focus on the settings when both RCT and RWD provide comparable covariates, treatment, and outcome information. In Aim 2, we develop improved analysis of RCT data to evaluate trimodality therapy versus surgery alone for the real-world and elderly esophageal cancer patients by exploiting the large sample size and predictive power offered by the NCDB/SEER-Medicare. In Aim 3, we develop new efﬁcient and data-adaptive methods to estimate individualized treatment effects of adjuvant chemotherapy versus observation, possibly modiﬁed by age and tumor size, for stage IB resected NSCLC patients by integrating RCT and NCDB data. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is closely in line with the 21st Century Cures Act, passed in 2016, which placed additional focus on the use of big real-world data to support decision making and precision medicine. The availability of multiple data sources, namely randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and real-world databases, presents unique and novel opportunities for medical research, because the knowledge that can be acquired from integrative analyses would not be possible from any single-source analysis alone. Our effort is important to bridge RCTs and vast real-world databases and registries arising from clinical practices in order to better understand how treatment works for the real-world and under-studied patient populations outside relatively narrow RCT eligibility criteria and provide accurate and reliable evidence for patient-centered care.",Empower treatment effects evaluation of randomized clinical trials for elderly patients with integrated real-world data,10149900,R01AG066883,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Calibration ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma ', ' NSCLC ', ' NSCLC - Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' Nonsmall Cell Lung Carcinoma ', ' nonsmall cell lung cancer ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Gold ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Target Populations ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Medical Research ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Adjuvant Chemotherapy ', ' Adjuvant Drug Therapy ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Sample Size ', ' SEER Program ', ' SEER-Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results ', ' Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results ', ' Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Patient-Centered Care ', ' Evidence Based Medicine ', ' Knowledge ', ' chemo-/radio-therapy ', ' chemo-radio-therapy ', ' chemo-radiotherapy ', ' chemoradiotherapy ', ' radio-chemo-therapy ', ' radio-chemotherapy ', ' radiochemotherapy ', ' chemoradiation ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Esophageal Cancer ', ' Esophagus Cancer ', ' Malignant Esophageal Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Esophageal Tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Esophagus ', ' oesophageal cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of esophagus ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer-directed therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' disease registry ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Exclusion Criteria ', ' Characteristics ', ' Resected ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' safety study ', ' health economics ', ' anticancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' treatment effect ', ' inclusion criteria ', ' tumor ', ' patient population ', ' population based ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment strategy ', ' clinical practice ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' individualized medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapeutic strategy ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' Therapy trial ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' treatment group ', ' study population ', ' Chemotherapy and/or radiation ', ' Chemotherapy and Radiation ', ' multiple data sources ', ' treatment comparison ', ' compare treatment ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' clinical trial analysis ', ' esophageal cancer patient ', ' ']",NIA,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R01,2021,391243,NC-02
"Rapid platelet dysfunction detection in whole blood samples using machine learning powered micro-clot imaging. Abstract This project will optimize a point-of-care (POC) platelet force monitoring technology for clinical application in trauma care. The leading causes of death and disability after trauma are related to hemorrhage and traumatic brain injury with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Platelets are critical to hemostasis by inducing clot formation via adhesion, aggregation, and contraction at wounds. Platelets often become dysfunctional after trauma which worsens internal bleeding and ICH progression and increasing morbidity. POC platelet assays have not been incorporated in practice due to:1) lack of large cohort ED patient testing; 2) poor accuracy in transfusion prediction and 3) extended processing times. We have made an innovative POC technology to test platelet function by directly measuring platelet contractile forces on microfluidic force sensors. Advantages of our POC test vs. existing assays: 1) rapid, direct activation and measures of platelet functions and 2) innovative machine vision with deep potential for machine learning insight. However, this technology needs optimization and validation in a large major ED trauma cohort and remains untested after ICH. Our pilot data suggests platelet contractile forces are sensitive to a range of relevant activation pathways and mechanisms and force is significantly decreased in trauma patients requiring blood transfusion. Further, in prior clinical trials, platelet transfusion has been found to be harmful when used indiscriminately. Building on this unmet scientific need, we will determine if our POC technology is predictive of hemorrhagic complications in trauma patients, informing a personalized transfusion strategy. Our overarching hypothesis is our POC platelet force monitor technology is an efficient indicator of bleeding complications after trauma and ICH. Aim 1: Optimize the platelet force monitor optics to improve platelet force sensor performance. We hypothesize the addition of a second fluorescent imaging channel can improve our current platelet force sensor performance. Aim 2: Use machine learning (ML) image analysis to improve detection of platelet dysfunction and prediction of trauma outcomes. We hypothesize image-based ML models can improve test performance. We will compare the accuracy of direct platelet force measurements (Aim 1) vs. ML-enhancement measurements for detecting platelet dysfunction and predicting outcomes. Aim 3: Validate our platelet function algorithm for predicting blood transfusion needs, mortality, and the progression of traumatic ICH in a prospective cohort of severely-injured ED trauma patients. We hypothesize platelet force will be a powerful predictor of blood transfusion needs, mortality, and progression of ICH. In the ED we will apply our algorithm (both the original and optimized algorithm from Aim 1) to blood from trauma patients and compare the predicted transfusion requirements against actual transfusion (Aim-3a) and measure the association between measured platelet force and ICH progression (Aim-3b). Project Narrative Rapidly identifying patients who are at risk for traumatic internal and intracranial bleeding would improve care by enabling personalized transfusion strategies. The current clinical approach causes undue morbidity and mortality because of late identification of those in need of a transfusion, resulting in delayed blood transfusion in those patients who would benefit, and unnecessary transfusions in those who would not. The proposed project improves and validates an innovative blood testing technology which has shown the potential to make rapid bleeding assessment of every patient both easy and accurate.",Rapid platelet dysfunction detection in whole blood samples using machine learning powered micro-clot imaging.,10146213,R61HL156508,"['Performance ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' performance tests ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' shear stress ', ' µfluidic ', ' Microfluidics ', ' Clotting ', ' Coagulation ', ' Coagulation Process ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Receptor Inhibition ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Preparation ', ' point of care ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Output ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' wound ', ' tissue wound ', ' wounding ', ' wounds ', ' prospective ', ' Trauma ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' fluorescence imaging ', ' fluorescent imaging ', ' clinical practice ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' trauma care ', ' Algorithmic Analysis ', ' Algorithmic Analyses ', ' Analyses of Algorithms ', ' Analysis of Algorithms ', ' Emergency Department patient ', ' ED patient ', ' ER patient ', ' Emergency Room patient ', ' Trauma patient ', ' diagnostic assay ', ' microsensor ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' Traumatic injury ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' nanonewton ', ' nano newton ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' platelet function ', ' machine vision ', ' severe injury ', ' critical injury ', ' devastating injury ', ' force sensor ', ' diagnostic technologies ', ' point of care testing ', ' Adhesions ', ' ADP Receptors ', ' Algorithms ', ' Arachidonic Acids ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Cells ', ' Peripheral Blood Cell ', ' Blood coagulation ', ' Blood Clotting ', ' Blood Platelets ', ' Marrow platelet ', ' Platelets ', ' Thrombocytes ', ' Blood Transfusion ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Color ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Electrons ', ' Negative Beta Particle ', ' Negatrons ', ' Engineering ', ' Freezing ', ' Gold ', ' Blood Tests ', ' Hematologic Tests ', ' Hematological Tests ', ' Hematology Testing ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Hemostatic function ', ' Hemostasis ', ' Hospitals ', ' Medicine ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Patients ', ' Platelet aggregation ', ' Platelet Function Tests ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Risk ', ' seal ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Platelet Transfusion ', ' Blood Platelet Transfusion ', ' Plts ', ' Caring ', ' Intracranial Hemorrhages ', ' base ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Transfusion ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Measurement ', ' Traumatic intracranial hemorrhage ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Point of Care Technology ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' Whole Blood ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' blood product ', ' ']",NHLBI,STASYS MEDICAL CORPORATION,R61,2021,294185,WA-07
"Using deep brain stimulation of the parietal cortex to investigate the electrophysiology of human episodic memory Project Summary Our proposal seeks to build upon the success of our lab investigating the electrophysiology of human memory through novel experiments that will elucidate hippocampal—parietal interactions in memory processing. The key innovations of this proposal are the application of direct brain stimulation to the mesial parietal cortex and the adaptation of an associative recognition paradigm to intracranial data. We will take advantage of our high-volume epilepsy surgical center specializing in stereo EEG electrode implantation. In our first aim, we will compare how electrophysiological patterns of brain activation differ between free recall (which comprises the bulk of intracranial memory data) and associative recognition, specifically examining properties of theta oscillations in the anterior versus posterior hippocampus. In the second aim, we will apply deep brain stimulation to the mesial parietal cortex during memory encoding and retrieval, observing differences in memory performance and hippocampal oscillatory activity that will inform hypotheses of how this area supports episodic memory. In Aim 3, we will use machine learning classifiers to understand how mesial parietal stimulation affects memory performance via its impact on brain oscillatory activity in a responsive stimulation paradigm. These experiments will utilize our lab’s knowledge and infrastructure gained through participation in the DARPA Restoring Active Memory project. While our proposal is highly innovative, our center’s proven success in recruiting a large volume of stereo EEG patients for memory research, data collection, and the application of advanced analytic techniques give us confidence that we will collect high quality data addressing the critical gaps in the understanding of human memory. Project Narrative Two critical gaps in our understanding of human memory are whether or not hippocampal theta oscillations support encoding in the same manner as in rodents, and the contribution of the mesial parietal cortex in encoding versus retrieval. These questions are closely linked together, and we propose to study them in stereo EEG patients using a novel memory paradigm coupled with deep brain stimulation. Our planned experiments include a closed-loop stimulation paradigm seeking to use parietal stimulation to improve memory performance, the results of which will both inform theories of human episodic memory processing and of the design of therapeutic brain stimulation devices to treat cognitive deficits.",Using deep brain stimulation of the parietal cortex to investigate the electrophysiology of human episodic memory,10201770,R01NS107357,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Anterior ', ' Area ', ' Animal Experiments ', ' Link ', ' analog ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Attenuated ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Deep Brain Stimulation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Parietal ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' memory recognition ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Episodic memory ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' memory processing ', ' memory process ', ' memory retrieval ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' memory decline ', ' Memory Loss ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' Brain region ', ' Effectiveness ', ' degenerative condition ', ' degenerative disease ', ' Degenerative Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Retrieval ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' direct application ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' implantation ', ' human disease ', ' memory encoding ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic strategies ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' human imaging ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', ' advanced analytics ', ' learning classifier ', ' ']",NINDS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,353797,TX-30
"Targeting pathologic spike-ripples to isolate and disrupt epileptic dynamics Project Summary Epilepsy is the world’s most common, serious brain disorder, affecting nearly 50 million people worldwide. For one-third of patients, seizures remain poorly controlled despite maximal medical management. In these patients, seizures often arise from a localized brain region, and neurosurgical interventions are the most effective treatment option. When successful, surgical interventions provide cure from seizures, and also prevent or reverse the disabling consequences of uncontrolled seizures. Critical to successful intervention is accurate identification of the core tissue responsible for generating seizures (i.e., the epileptogenic zone). Traditionally, this tissue would be surgically resected, but modern approaches aim to focally disrupt this tissue with targeted electrical stimulation (i.e. neuromodulation). Improvements in epilepsy care are now limited by (i) the inability to accurately identify the epileptogenic zone; (ii) a limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying epileptiform activity; (iii) a lack of understanding of how to target these mechanisms with neurostimulation. The most common approach to identify the epileptogenic zone is through continuous recording of a patient’s cortical electrical activity to capture seizures. However, because seizures are infrequent, this approach is expensive, time consuming, and unpleasant for patients. Moreover, this approach often fails to identify the epileptogenic zone, resulting in unsuccessful neurosurgical intervention in 20-70% of cases. To address this, interictal biomarkers of the epileptogenic zone that manifest between seizures are required. Two such biomarkers have been proposed: (a) interictal discharges or spikes, and (b) high frequency oscillations or ripples. While both signals have been extensively studied, neither accurately delimits the epileptogenic zone. Spikes are specific for epilepsy, but too spatially diffuse to identify the epileptogenic zone. Ripples are spatially focal, but represent both pathologic and physiologic processes. We address these limitations by focusing on the simultaneous occurrence of a spike and ripple, “spike-ripple” discharges, as an improved biomarker for the epileptogenic zone. Spike-ripples commonly occur in patients with epilepsy, improve the spatial specificity of spikes for the epileptogenic zone, and disentangle physiologic from pathologic ripples. Our interdisciplinary team will apply expertise in epilepsy, neurophysiology, neurosurgery, animal experiments, modeling, and statistics to: (i) develop a fully automated spike-ripple detector and compare its clinical utility to predict surgical outcome to spikes and ripples alone, (ii) identify the biological mechanisms that generate spike-ripple discharges using novel voltage imaging techniques in animal models combined with computational models; and (iii) develop principled neurostimulation protocols to disrupt the mechanisms that generate spike-ripples. Completion of these Aims will represent significant progress towards resolving fundamental questions in modern epilepsy research, an understanding of mechanisms in the core epileptogenic network that generate spike-ripples, and a principled approach to neurostimulation to focally disrupt these pathologic dynamics. Project Narrative Neurosurgical treatment of epilepsy often fails, and neurostimulation to treat epilepsy remains suboptimal and ad hoc. Identification of an improved biomarker - to target epilepsy treatment and assess treatment efficacy - is required. This project combines clinical data from human patients, experiments in animal models, and computer simulations of brain activity to develop an improved biomarker for epilepsy treatment, and to develop a deeper understanding of the mechanisms driving the pathological brain dynamics in epilepsy.",Targeting pathologic spike-ripples to isolate and disrupt epileptic dynamics,10096727,R01NS119483,"['Action Potentials ', ' Affect ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' computational simulation ', ' computerized simulation ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electric Stimulation ', ' Electrical Stimulation ', ' electrostimulation ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' High Frequency Oscillation ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' neurosurgery ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Pathologic Processes ', ' Pathological Processes ', ' Patients ', ' Physiological Processes ', ' Organism-Level Process ', ' Organismal Process ', ' Physiologic Processes ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Seizures ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Generations ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Caring ', ' detector ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Refractory ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' Animal Experiments ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Event ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' human data ', ' voltage ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' novel ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Refractory epilepsy ', ' drug-resistant epilepsy ', ' Intractable Epilepsy ', ' Institution ', ' Brain region ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' in vivo ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Resected ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' excitatory neuron ', ' inhibitory neuron ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Consumption ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' successful intervention ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' clinical practice ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' imaging approach ', ' imaging based approach ', ' surgery outcome ', ' surgical outcome ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' in silico ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' ']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,698329,MA-08
"SCH: INT: Collaborative Research: Multimodal Signal Analysis and Data Fusion for Post-traumatic Epilepsy The research objective of this proposal, Multimodal Signal Analysis and Data Fusion for Post-traumatic Epilepsy Prediction, with Pl Dominique Duncan from the University of Southern California, is to predict the onset of epileptic seizures following traumatic brain injury (TBI), using innovative analytic tools from machine learning and applied mathematics to identify features of epileptiform activity, from a multimodal dataset collected from both an animal model and human patients. The proposed research will accelerate the discovery of salient and robust features of epileptogenesis following TBI from a rich dataset, collected from the Epilepsy Bioinformatics Study for Antiepileptogenic Therapy (EpiBioS4Rx), as it is being acquired by investigating state-of-the-art models, methods, and algorithms from contemporary machine learning theory. This secondary use of data to support automated discovery of reliable knowledge from aggregated records of animal model and human patient data will lead to innovative models to predict post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE). This machine learning based investigation of a rich dataset complements ongoing data acquisition and classical biostatistics-based analyses ongoing in the study and can lead to rigorous outcomes for the development of antiepileptogenic therapies, which can prevent this disease. Identifying salient features in time series and images to help design a predictor of PTE using data from two species and multiple individuals with heterogeneous TBI conditions presents significant theoretical challenges that need to be tackled. In this project, it is proposed to adopt transfer learning and domain adaptation perspectives to accomplish these goals in multimodal biomedical datasets across two populations. Specifically, techniques emerging from d,eep learning literature will be exploited to augment data, share parameters across model components to reduce the number of parameters that need to be optimized, and use state-of-the-art architectures to develop models for feature extraction. These will be compared against established pipelines of hand-crafted feature extraction in rigorous cross-validation analyses. Developed techniques for transfer learning will be able to extract features that generalize across animal and human data. Moreover, these theoretical techniques with associated models and optimization methods will be applicable to other multi-species transfer learning challenges that may arise in the context of health and medicine. Multimodal feature extraction and discriminative model learning for disease onset prediction using novel classifiers also offer insights into biomarker discovery using advanced machine learning techniques through joint multimodal data analysis. A significant percentage of people develop epilepsy after a moderate-severe traumatic brain injury. If we can identify who will develop post-traumatic epilepsy and at what time point after the injury, those patients can be treated with antiepileptogenic therapies and medications to stop or prevent the seizures from occurring. It is likely that biomarkers of epileptogenesis after TBI can only be found by analyzing multimodal data from a large population, which requires advanced mathematical tools and models.",SCH: INT:

"Characterizing Population Differences between Clinical Trial and Real World Populations Randomized controlled trials are the gold standard for measuring the effect of a treatment or intervention. Unfortunately, it is not feasible to conduct a randomized controlled trial to test all research questions, whether due to cost, achieving sufficient subject sizes or when administering an arm of the trial would be unethical. To understand the effects of therapeutics, policy changes, and other interventions where it is not possible to administer a clinical trial, researchers have developed approaches that attempt to simulate clinical trials in observational data. Despite sophisticated statistical methodologies, it is not clear whether it is possible to reliably simulate a randomized controlled in observational data. We aim to quantify one potential driver of these different results, differences between the clinical trial and real-world populations. In Aim 1, we compare trials that have individual level data available to three real- world data sources. In Aim 2, we develop methodologies to infer most likely individual-level statistics from aggregate trial statistics using real world data. Finally, in Aim 3 we compare neurological trials that do not release individual level data to real world data. We then estimate the transportability of treatment estimates across different populations including: the population eligible for the trial in RWD and the population ineligible for the trial but receiving the treatment in RWD. This allows for the study of indication drift and treatment heterogeneity. By uncovering differences between these groups, we may be able to identify groups that are underrepresented in clinical trials to help reduce healthcare disparities. The K99/R00 award will allow me to gain expertise in using regulatory sciences (with mentor Dr. Florence Bourgeois and advisor Dr. Deborah Schrag) for biologic discovery (with mentors Dr. Tianxi Cai and Dr. Isaac Kohane) within neurology (with mentors Dr. Page Pennell and Dr. Clemens Scherzer). My background in statistics, informatics, genetics, and machine learning with clinical data sources ideally positions me for the proposed project. The proposed training plan, mentoring and project will provide a strong foundation for a successful transition to independent research. Clinical trial populations are a subset of the overall population and may be biased through several factors. To better understand disease, reduce healthcare disparities for underrepresented groups, assess drug approvals, and ensure safety as the indications for a drug expand it is critical to quantify how representative clinical trials are of the real-world population. Identifying enriched and underrepresented groups offers the opportunity to identify subpopulations who may have heterogeneous treatment effects and/or underlying physiologies.",Characterizing Population Differences between Clinical Trial and Real World Populations,10127341,K99NS114850,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Award ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Estrogens ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Exhibits ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Gait ', ' Genes ', ' Geography ', ' glucosylceramidase ', ' Acid beta-Glucosidase ', ' D-Glucosyl-N-acylsphingosine glucosylhydrolase ', ' Glucocerebrosidase ', ' Glucocerebroside beta-Glucosidase ', ' Glucosyl Ceramidase ', ' Glucosylceramide beta-Glucosidase ', ' Glucosylsphingosine Glucosyl Hydrolase ', ' beta-Glucocerebrosidase ', ' glucosphingosine glucosylhydrolase ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitals ', ' Insurance ', ' Menarche ', ' Menopause ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Neurology ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' Placebos ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' sham therapy ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Safety ', ' Science ', ' Seizures ', ' statistics ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Tremor ', ' Woman ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Drug Approval ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Perinatal ', ' Peripartum ', ' Polypharmacy ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Hormonal ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Informatics ', ' Orphan Disease ', ' Rare Disorder ', ' orphan disorder ', ' Rare Diseases ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' reproductive ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' disease subgroups ', ' disease subtype ', ' disorder subtype ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Perimenopausal ', ' peri-menopausal ', ' peri-menopause ', ' Perimenopause ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Validation ', ' sex ', ' Therapeutic Effect ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' birth control ', ' cost ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Population ', ' treatment effect ', ' trial comparing ', ' inclusion criteria ', ' therapeutic development ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' patient population ', ' standard measure ', ' standard of care ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' arm ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' under representation of groups ', ' under represented groups ', ' under represented populations ', ' underrepresentation of groups ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' disparate health care ', ' disparate healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' oncology trial ', ' multiple data sources ', ' efficacy clinical trial ', ' unethical ', ' effectiveness analysis ', ' socioeconomic diversity ', ' socio-economic diversity ', ' ']",NINDS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K99,2021,118759,MA-07
"Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm PROJECT SUMMARY The development of large observational health databases (OHD) has expanded the data available for analysis by pharmacoepidemiology research. The efficiency of these studies may be improved by simultaneously studying the association of multiple medications with a disease of interest. Unfortunately, prior research has demonstrated that it is difficult to distinguish true-positive from false-positive results when studying multiple exposures simultaneously, thus limiting the conclusions drawn from these types of studies and representing a major gap in the field. The objective of this proposal, which is the first step in achieving the applicant's long- term goal of improving the diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases using insights derived from OHD, is to evaluate and validate medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA), a novel set-based signal-to- noise enrichment algorithm developed by the applicant to analyze multiple exposures from OHD with high sensitivity and specificity. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that MCEA has equal sensitivity and greater specificity compared to logistic regression, the most widely used analytic method for OHD, for identifying true associations between medications and clinical outcomes. The applicant will complete the following two interrelated specific aims to test the hypothesis: Aim 1 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA) and logistic regression (LR) for identifying medication associations with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and Aim 2 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of MCEA and LR for identifying medication associations with gastrointestinal hemorrhage (GIH). The rationale for these aims is that by reproducing known medication-disease associations without false positives, MCEA can be used to identify novel pharmacologic associations with gastrointestinal diseases in future studies. The expected outcome for the proposed research is that it will demonstrate MCEA as a valid method for pharmacoepidemiology research, opening new research opportunities for the study of multi-exposure OHD. These new research opportunities may lead to more rapid identification of potential pharmacologic causes of emerging diseases and discovery of unanticipated beneficial medication effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications. To attain the expected outcome, the applicant will complete additional coursework that builds on his Master of Science in Clinical Epidemiology to learn computational biology, machine learning, and econometrics techniques. With the support of this grant and his institution, he will also directly apply these techniques to pharmacoepidemiology applications under the close mentorship of a carefully selected team of faculty with extensive experience in gastroenterology, pharmacoepidemiology, medical informatics, and mentoring prior K-award grant recipients. Through these activities, the applicant will develop the skills necessary to obtain NIH R01-level funding and become a leader in developing novel techniques for application to the epidemiologic study of gastrointestinal diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Traditionally, research studying medications associated with diseases are limited to analyzing one medication at a time. This novel proposal will validate medication class enrichment analysis, a recently developed algorithm to study multiple medications simultaneously for association with a disease of interest. Validation of this method will allow researchers to use existing medical databases to more rapidly identify potential medication causes of emerging diseases and identify medications with unanticipated beneficial effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications.",Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm,10128442,K08DK119475,"['Algorithms ', ' Aminoglycosides ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', ' NSAIDs ', ' Non Steroidal Antiinflammatory Agents ', ' Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', ' Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Agents ', ' Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Drug ', ' non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ', ' non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs ', ' nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Anticoagulants ', ' Anticoagulant Agents ', ' Anticoagulant Drugs ', ' blood thinner ', ' thrombopoiesis inhibitor ', ' Carbapenems ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Cephalosporins ', ' Charge ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Digestive System Disorders ', ' Digestive Diseases ', ' Digestive System Diseases ', ' GI tract disorder ', ' digestive disorder ', ' digestive tract disease ', ' gastrointestinal tract disease ', ' gastrointestinal tract disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Gastroenterology ', ' Gastrointestinal Diseases ', ' gastrointestinal disorder ', ' Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage ', ' GI bleeding ', ' GI hemorrhage ', ' gastrointestinal bleeding ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Infection ', ' Inpatients ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Medical Informatics ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Noise ', ' Penicillins ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United Kingdom ', ' United States Department of Veterans Affairs ', ' United States Veterans Administration ', ' Veterans Administration ', ' Veterans Affairs ', ' Clostridium difficile ', ' C diff ', ' C difficile ', ' C. diff ', ' C. difficile ', ' Clostridioides difficile ', ' Generations ', ' Antiplatelet Drugs ', ' Antiplatelet Agents ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Pharmacoepidemiology ', ' Pharmaceutical Epidemiology ', ' drug epidemiology ', ' pharmacoepidemiologic ', ' pharmacoepidemiological ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' beta-Lactams ', ' β-Lactams ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' computer biology ', ' Computational Biology ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Informatics ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' career development ', ' Genomics ', ' Fluoroquinolones ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Master of Science ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Outcome ', ' usability ', ' clinical epidemiology ', ' Big Data to Knowledge ', ' BD2K ', ' econometrics ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K08,2021,35124,PA-03
"Neurophysiology of Human Cortical Epilepsy ABSTRACT Epilepsy remains a devastating and poorly understood illness whose therapies are inadequate for many patients and, in large degree, unchanged for decades. The experiments proposed in this project utilize novel microelectrode recording techniques in patients with epilepsy as well as quantitative features and large data sets to obtain information about the neuronal dynamics underlying epilepsy at an unprecedented level of resolution. The primary hypothesis of this project is that this high resolution, multi-scale information can be applied to separate seizures into different classes which differ in the mechanisms which underlie seizure initiation. More specifically, we will be examining the role and interplay of widespread networks, different cortical layers, infraslow activity and both excitatory and inhibitory single neuronal activity as seizures start. We expect to find substantial differences in these different features of neural action in different kinds of seizures. This knowledge will foster the development of a more complete understanding of seizures and how they can be better detected, predicted and ultimately controlled.

"Identifying False HPV-Vaccine Information and Modeling Its Impact on Risk Perceptions PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States, with over 30,000 new HPV-related-cancers are diagnosed annually. Although HPV vaccines have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 2006 and recommended for routine vaccination for school-age girls and boys, vaccination rates remain low. One reason that has contributed to low vaccination rates is incorrect “risk perceptions” around HPV vaccines such as the high perceived risks of adverse events or side effects from the HPV vaccine. Incorrect risk perceptions are often rooted in the false information about HPV vaccines that people are exposed to in their daily life, including social media. The impact of social media on health information is substantial. Negative social-media HPV-vaccine information has been found to have an association with low vaccination coverage. Given the negative consequences of false information, there is a need to develop a robust and scalable way to detect false HPV-vaccine information before it propagates and negatively impacts behavior. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to build a model to identify false HPV-vaccine information on Twitter, demonstrate its impact on individual risk perceptions and measure its underlying mechanisms on risk perception formation. We propose a novel approach to leverage machine learning, natural language processing, network analysis, crowdsourcing/expert data annotation, psycholinguistic analysis and statistical modeling to investigate the false HPV-vaccine information collectively (in terms of its detection and propagation patterns) and individually (in terms of its impact and underlying cognitive mechanisms). Our study will first build a computational model to detect false HPV-vaccine information on Twitter. By modeling the domain-specific HPV- vaccine related text content, information-veracity related linguistic features, individual and collective user behaviors, and dissemination patterns, our model will be able to detect false HPV-vaccine information before it gets verified and spreads widely. We will then investigate the impact of false HPV-vaccine information on risk perceptions around HPV vaccination operationalized by natural language processing methods and a developed HPV-vaccine Risk Lexicon. We will further conduct psycholinguistic analysis on the false HPV-vaccine information and use statistical modeling to uncover the underlying mechanism of risk perceptions. Our study will make a critical and timely contribution to identifying the false HPV-vaccine information and its impact, which has the potential to be applied to other health topics. This proposed project will also address the National Cancer Institute priorities in promoting HPV vaccines and combating misinformation in cancer prevention and control. PROJECT NARRATIVE The uptake of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine remains low in part because of incorrect perceptions of vaccination risks, which has been linked to the spread of false HPV-vaccine information. The proposed study seeks to build a computational model to detect false HPV-vaccine information on social media (Twitter) and determine its impact on risk perceptions of the HPV vaccine. The findings will provide important contributions to understand the impact of false health information on HPV vaccination behavior and could be expanded to other health topics.",Identifying False HPV-Vaccine Information and Modeling Its Impact on Risk Perceptions,10114245,R21CA237483,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Communication ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' wart virus ', ' Information Dissemination ', ' dissemination of results ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Politics ', ' Psycholinguistics ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Semantics ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' USFDA ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Misinformation ', ' Comprehension ', ' Link ', ' Lesion ', ' Individual ', ' School-Age Population ', ' school age ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' uptake ', ' cancer prevention ', ' news ', ' Exposure to ', ' HPV infection ', ' Human papillomavirus infection ', ' Human papilloma virus infection ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Participant ', ' Harm Minimization ', ' Harm Reduction ', ' Categories ', ' risk perception ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' multi-level model ', ' multilevel model ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' HPV-Related Malignancy ', ' HPV-associated cancer ', ' HPV-associated malignancy ', ' HPV-related cancer ', ' Human Papilloma Virus-Related Malignancy ', ' Human Papilloma Virus-associated cancer ', ' Human Papilloma Virus-associated malignancy ', ' Human Papilloma Virus-related cancer ', ' Human papillomavirus-Related Malignancy ', ' Human papillomavirus-Related Malignant Neoplasm ', ' human papillomavirus associated malignancy ', ' human papillomavirus-associated cancer ', ' human papillomavirus-related cancer ', ' Human Papilloma Virus-Related Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' HPV Vaccine ', ' Human papillomavirus Vaccine ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' precancerous ', ' premalignant ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cognitive ', ' Text ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' high risk ', ' information processing ', ' information model ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination ', ' HPV Vaccination ', ' Human Papillomavirus Vaccination ', ' Electronic cigarette ', ' e-cig ', ' e-cigarette ', ' ecig ', ' ecigarette ', ' crowdsourcing ', ' crowd source ', ' crowd-sourcing ', ' crowdsource ', ' social media ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' Twitter ', ' side effect ', ' adverse event risk ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' vaccine acceptance ', ' accept vaccination ', ' accept vaccine ', ' vaccination acceptability ', ' vaccination acceptance ', ' vaccination confidence ', ' vaccination uptake ', ' vaccination willingness ', ' vaccine acceptability ', ' vaccine confidence ', ' vaccine uptake ', ' vaccine willingness ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2021,174255,IL-13
"Neurophysiologically-informed Design of Flexible, 2-learner Brain-Machine Interfaces for Robust and Skillful Performance PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal aims to elucidate the computational and neural basis of neuroprosthetic skill learning by leveraging recent advances in the science and engineering of closed-loop brain-machine interfacing. The outcome of the proposed work has the potential to guide the development of the next generation of neurophysiologically-informed, cortically-controlled neuroprosthetic systems for patients with neurological disorders. State-of-the-art brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) leverage machine learning to rapidly calibrate to the neural activity of individuals, but performance also benefits from subjects learning to reliably produce desired neural activity patterns. The basic science and engineering principles of designing such a “2-learner BMI” in which the brain and machine synergistically learn are not well understood. Hence, this proposal aims to investigate how the brain learns when the machine undergoes different degrees of learning, how different degrees of brain learning affect long-term BMI performance, robustness, and generalization, and how these principles can guide the design of a 2-learner BMI system which facilitates brain learning. The proposal is structured in three aims: 1) To study the impact of decoder adaptation on the development of neural encoding models underlying neuroprosthetic skill; 2) To Study how decoder adaptation and resultant neural encoding model influences BMI performance with perturbations (robustness) and BMI performance on unpracticed tasks (generalization); and 3) Design and validation of the next-generation Flexible 2-Learner Decoder architecture. The analyses and experiments proposed in these aims will leverage the fundamental knowledge gained about how the brain learns and acquires neuroprosthetic skills into the neurophysiologically-informed design of robust and high-performance closed-loop motor neuroprosthetics that generalize to new tasks.

"BrainStorm: Highly Extensible Software for Advanced Electrophysiology and MEG/EEG Imaging Project Summary Electrophysiological recordings in humans and animals play an essential role in developing an understanding of the human brain. Signal recording technology spans the entire scale from invasive microelectrode single-unit recordings, through mesoscale macroelectrode measures of local field potentials, to whole-brain monitoring through measurement of scalp potentials (EEG) and extracranial magnetic fields (MEG). Analysis of these data presents a host of challenges, from low level noise removal and artifact rejection to sophisticated spatio-temporal modeling and statistical inference. The multidisciplinary neuroscience research community has an ongoing need for validated and documented open-source software to perform this analysis and to facilitate reproducible and large-scale research involving electrophysiological data. This proposal describes our plans to continue to develop and support Brainstorm, open-source software that meets this need. Brainstorm is a Matlab/Java multi-platform (Linux, MacOS, Windows) software package for analysis and visualization of electrophysiological data. The software is extensively documented through a series of detailed tutorials and actively supported through a user forum and a mailing list. Over the past 8 years we have registered 16,000 distinct users, provided hands on instruction to 1,200 trainees, and the software has been used and cited in ~600 journal papers. Brainstorm includes tools for importing MEG/EEG, intracranial EEG, animal electrophysiology, and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data from multiple vendors, extensive interactive features for data preprocessing, selection and visualization, coregistration to volume and surface MRIs and atlases, forward and inverse mapping of cortical current density, time-series and connectivity analysis, and a range of statistical tools. Data can be analyzed through a graphical interface or through scripted pipelines. The current proposal represents a plan to extend Brainstorm in a manner that leverages the unique features of our software and addresses important needs for large-scale data analysis. In this project we will continue to extend and support our software through the following three specific aims: (i) we will harness recent developments in distributed and shared data and high performance computing resources, together with standardization of data organization, to facilitate large-scale, reproducible analysis of electrophysiological data. (ii) We will also address the need for improved modeling resulting from the increasing use of both invasive recordings and direct brain stimulation through development of new modeling software for accurate computation of the intracranial electromagnetic fields produced by brain stimulation and neuronal activation. (iii) Finally, we will continue to add new functionality and to support the software through in-person training, online forums, documentation and other resources. Project Narrative Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Electroencephalography (EEG) are absolutely non-invasive brain imaging tools, which provide information on the spatial distribution and precise temporal orchestration of human brain activity. In addition to basic neuroscience research, MEG and EEG can be also used to understand and diagnose abnormalities underlying a wide range neurological and psychiatric illnesses, including epilepsy, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as cognitive deficits such as delayed acquisition of language. The neuroscience research community has an ongoing need for validated and documented open-source software to perform these analyses and to facilitate reproducible and large-scale research involving electrophysiological data. This proposal describes our plans to continue to develop and support Brainstorm, open-source software that meets these needs with well-documented and tested novel analyses using MEG and EEG in

"Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly (SPEEDe) ABSTRACT Adverse events (AEs) – harm to patients that results from medical care – affect as many as 13.5% of hospitalized patients; half of these AEs are preventable and AEs particularly affect the elderly. AEs are notoriously difficult to measure accurately. A variety of paper and electronic trigger tools have been developed to identify AEs; however, their positive predictive value (PPV) is low, requiting subsequent, time-intensive manual chart review to accurately measure AEs. In the proposed project, we will use innovative, state-of-the-art machine interactive learning (IML) techniques to refine existing AE triggers, improving their accuracy substantially. We will also develop a novel AE Explorer to speed review of possible AEs, as well as an innovative package of predictive analytics tools and methods to measure and detect them. Our approach combines and compares expert-driven improvement with the most recent IML techniques to make triggers more accurate, with the ultimate goal of creating triggers that are accurate enough to stand in as proxies for actual measurement of harm. We call our approach Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly, or SPEEDe. Our team of accomplished machine learning, patient safety, risk management, AE detection, geriatric medicine and trigger tool experts will work together to carry out the specific aims of this project: (1) prototype and rapidly iterate a trigger review dashboard (the Adverse Event Explorer) using a user-centered design process, (2) develop and evaluate novel Interactive Machine Learning approaches for more efficient and accurate adverse event chart review and trigger refinement, and (3) Integrate Interactive Machine Learning into the Adverse Event Explorer and evaluate it prospectively in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adverse events – harm to patients that results from medical care – are common and difficult to identify and measure using existing tools. Accurate real-time measures of adverse events would enable organizations to track harm over time, identify and prioritize areas for safety improvements, evaluate whether patient safety programs are effective, and communicate risks of harm to patients and caregivers. Through SPEEDe, we will develop an innovative machine- learning approach for accurately detecting adverse events in the elderly in real-time.",Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly (SPEEDe),10109965,R01AG062499,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Geriatrics ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Grant ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incentives ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Memory ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Management ', ' Safety ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caring ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' detector ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Training ', ' Intuition ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Active Learning ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Performance ', ' Proxy ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' patient safety ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Detection ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Process ', ' cost ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' biomed informatics ', ' forging ', ' Minority ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' analytical tool ', ' open source ', ' user centered design ', ' iterative design ', ' prototype ', ' health information technology ', ' hands-on learning ', ' applied learning ', ' interactive engagement ', ' interactive learning ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' dashboard ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' advanced analytics ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' detection platform ', ' detection system ', ' open source tool ', ' open source toolkit ', ' ']",NIA,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,661688,TN-05
"Improving representation of non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic study participants in a trial of virtual reality for chronic lower back pain PROJECT SUMMARY Although digital health technologies are now widely available for both therapeutic and monitoring applications, there are racial and ethnic disparities in uptake and effectiveness of digital health interventions. Of relevance to our parent HEAL study examining a digital health intervention (virtual reality) for pain management, recent data indicate that non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic patients are less likely to have access to digital health information and more likely to report severe pain than non-Hispanic whites. In addition to disparities in access and adoption of digital health interventions, there are known disparities in the incidence and reporting of pain by racial and ethnic minorities. For example, study of 2000 patients found that non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic patients were more likely to report severe pain than non-Hispanic whites. The proposed study for this Diversity, Inclusion and Engagement Supplement to our NIH HEAL study evaluating the role of therapeutic VR for chronic lower back pain (cLBP) will provide a framework to advance diversity and inclusion efforts for future digital health trials at our medical center and beyond. Further, it will enhance the parent study by seeking to increase the proportion of participants with historically less access to and familiarity with digital technologies while enhancing overall participant racial and ethnic diversity. Using the NIH Stage Model for Behavioral Intervention Development supported by advances in artificial intelligence (AI)-driven cohort building tools, we propose to meaningfully improve enrollment rates of non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic participants in our parent NIH HEAL study by achieving two aims: (1) tailor recruitment materials for non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic patients with cLBP in partnership with representative patient advisory boards; and (2) oversample non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic participants in parent study using an AI-driven cohort building tool housed within the electronic health record. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although digital health technologies are now widely available for both therapeutic and monitoring applications, there are disparities in patient knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and preferences regarding uptake and effectiveness of digital health interventions.

"Detection and characterization of critical under-immunized hotspots - Summer Undergraduate Support Detection and characterization of critical under-immunized hotspots  Emergence of undervaccinated geographical clusters for diseases like measles has become a national concern. A number of measles outbreaks have occurred in recent months, despite high MMR coverage in the United States ( 95%). Such undervaccinated clusters can act as reservoirs of infection that can transmit the disease to a wider population, magnifying their importance far beyond what their absolute numbers might indicate. The existence and growth of such undervaccinated clusters is often known to public health agencies and health provider networks, but they typically do not have enough resources to target people in each such cluster, to attempt to improve the vaccination rate. Preliminary results show that not all undervaccinated clusters are “equal” in terms of their potential for causing a big outbreak (referred to as its “criticality”), and the rate of undervaccination in a cluster does not necessarily correlate with its criticality.  However, there are no existing methods to estimate the potential risk of such clusters, and to identify the most “critical” ones. Some of the key reasons are: (i) purely data-driven spatial statistics methods rely only on immunization coverage, which does not give any indication of the risk of an outbreak; and (ii) current causal epidemic models need to be combined with detailed incidence data, which has not been easily available.  This proposal brings together a systems science approach, combining agent-based stochastic epidemic models, and techniques from machine learning, high performance computing, data mining, and spatial statistics, along with novel public and private datasets on immunization and incidence, to develop a novel methodology for identifying critical clusters, through the following tasks: (i) Identify spatial clusters with signiﬁcantly low immunization rates, or strong anti-vaccine sentiment; (ii) Develop an agent based model for the spread of measles that incorporates detailed immunization data, and is calibrated using a novel source of incidence data; (iii) Develop methods to ﬁnd and characterize critical spatial clusters, with respect to different metrics, which capture both epidemic and economic burden, and order underimmunized clusters based on their criticality; and (iv) Use the methodology to evaluate interventions in terms of their effect on criticality. A highly interdisciplinary team involving two universities, a health care delivery organization and a state department of Health, will work together to develop this methodology. Characterization of such clusters will enable public health departments and policy makers in targeted surveillance of their regions and a more efﬁcient allocation of resources. Project Narrative  This project will develop a new methodology to quantify the potential risks of under-vaccinated spatial clusters for highly infectious diseases. It will rank the clusters based on their economic and epidemic burden which will enable public health ofﬁcials in targeted surveillance and interventions, to mitigate their risk.",Detection and characterization of critical under-immunized hotspots - Summer Undergraduate Support,10393815,R01GM109718,"['Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health delivery systems ', ' health services delivery ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease Clusterings ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemic ', ' Geography ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Immunization ', ' Immunologic Sensitization ', ' Immunologic Stimulation ', ' Immunological Sensitization ', ' Immunological Stimulation ', ' Immunostimulation ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Measles ', ' Rubeola ', ' morbilli ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Privatization ', ' Public Health ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' statistics ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' Work ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Policy Maker ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' high-end computing ', ' High Performance Computing ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Vaccinated ', ' Population ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergrad ', ' undergraduate ', ' Immunize ', ' provider networks ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2021,11253,VA-05
"Multilevel Determinants of Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Maternal Morbidity and Mortality in the Context of COVID-19 Pandemic Abstract Annually in the U.S., nearly 60,000 women experience severe maternal morbidity and mortality (SMMM) with substantial health disparities by race/ethnicity, even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic has hit communities of color the hardest. Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic women who are pregnant appear to have disproportionate SARS-CoV-2 infection and death rates. Questions regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on racial disparities in SMMM and the dynamics and interactions of multilevel determinants such as broader social contexts of SMMM remain unanswered. The overarching goal of this study is to investigate racial/ethnic disparities in maternal morbidity and mortality (MMM), the contributing roles and mediating pathways of social contexts (e.g., residential segregation, racial discrimination in poverty, education, unemployment, and home ownership), and their long-standing health consequences postpartum. We will achieve our goal by studying the distributions of COVID-19 cases and multilevel determinants of maternal health in South Carolina (SC), a state with persistent racial disparities in SMMM within historical systemic Southern contexts, and in the U.S. We will build upon our existing statewide SC COVID-19 Cohort (S3C) by creating a pregnancy cohort that will link COVID-19 testing data, electronic health records (EHR), and birth certificate data for all births in SC in 2019-2020. To ensure the generalizability of our findings, we will confirm them using EHR data from the ongoing National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C). Nationwide social context databases and time-varying COVID-19 severity and social distancing policies will be added to S3C and N3c data. We will use the socio-ecological framework and employ a concurrent triangulation, mixed methods study design to achieve three specific aims: 1) to examine the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on racial/ethnic disparities in MMM; 2) to examine and explore how the key features of social contexts have contributed to the widening of racial/ethnic disparities in MMM during the pandemic (Aim 2a) and identify distinct mediating pathways through maternity care and mental health (Aim 2b); and 3) to examine the role of social contextual factors and identify protective factors for racial/ethnic disparities in pregnancy-related, long-standing morbidities using machine learning algorithms. For Aim 2b, a convergent parallel design will be used, which includes a quantitative analysis of data from SC PRAMS and qualitative interviews of postpartum women (20 Black, 20 Hispanics) and 10 maternal care providers. Our experienced team is well positioned to investigate the complexity of racial disparities in MMM during the COVID-19 pandemic, while considering historical structural racism in a racially, socioeconomically, and geographically diverse population of pregnant women. A rigorous examination of social contexts on racial/ethnic disparities in MMM and mental health during the pandemic will inform continuing efforts to reverse the rising trends of SMMM in the U.S. Our proposal addresses Areas 1, 2, & 4 in the NOT-OD-21-071. Narrative Although the COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented societal disruptions to individuals, communities, healthcare institutions, and society as a whole, it has hit communities of color the hardest. Empirical data on the scope of widening racial disparities in maternal morbidity and mortality and how historical structural racism and discrimination of all types have impacted women of color disproportionally are sparse. This study will be among the first to investigate whether the COVID-19 pandemic, structural racism, and racial discrimination– exposures with broad scale and reach – have contributed to the racial/ethnic disparities in maternal morbidity and mortality in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.",Multilevel Determinants of Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Maternal Morbidity and Mortality in

"Leveraging machine learning to improve risk prediction for chemotherapy inducedneuropathy Project Summary/Abstract Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) affects more than two-thirds of adults with invasive cancer who receive select adjuvant chemotherapies (e.g., taxanes, platinum analogs). Severe CIPN symptoms can lead to chemotherapy dose reductions, treatment delays, or changes in treatment regimens; thereby affecting the potential curative effects of chemotherapy. For some patients, CIPN symptoms can persist over time, contributing to lower quality of life.  Little is known about risk factors for CIPN. Chemotoxicity risk scores have been developed and evaluated for use among elderly patients receiving chemotherapy. However, these tools generally report moderate predictive accuracy (60%-70%), small sample sizes, and short-term follow up. We are aware of no publicly available, validated risk models to assess risk of severe and chronic CIPN among diverse patients at risk for this potentially disabling side effect.  The goal of this proposal is to identify patients at risk for CIPN and to understand how patients and provider interpret and use CIPN risk information in clinical decision-making. Focusing on more than 8,500 insured adults (18+) diagnosed with invasive, stage I-III breast and II-IIIA colorectal cancers (2013-2021) who received adjuvant chemotherapy treatment with known risk for CIPN, we will develop and validate predictive models to quantify the risk of severe CIPN and incident chronic CIPN and assess how CIPN risk information might be used to inform clinical decision-making about cancer treatment and survivorship care planning.  We hypothesize that CIPN risk is a high priority for patients in thinking about treatment choice and survivorship care planning. In addition, we hypothesize that the relative importance of CIPN risk for patient and provider decision-making will vary by patient characteristics (e.g., age, cancer stage). We anticipate that the risk of severe and chronic CIPN can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy using electronic health records and machine learning methods.  The study team has significant and complementary expertise in health services research, biostatistics and predictive modeling, oncology practice, cancer epidemiology, pharmacotherapy, drug safety and the patient care experience. To our knowledge, this will be one of the first studies to develop and validate a CIPN predictive model that can be used by oncology teams to inform treatment and care planning decisions and improve patient-valued outcomes. Translation and replication of the findings will be catalyzed through publication in peer-reviewed journals and the development and distribution of free software to facilitate testing and adaptation of the resulting risk models across diverse systems of care. Narrative Two out of three people treated with select types of chemotherapy experience a side effect known as peripheral neuropathy that causes pain, discomfort and numbness in the extremities and contributes to poor quality of life. We do not know who is at greatest risk for this side effect or how patients and providers weigh the risks of neuropathy against the potentially life-saving benefits of cancer treatment. The proposed study will help identify patients at high risk for chemotherapy induced neuropathy and assess how patients and clinicians might use information about neuropathy risk to make better informed decisions about cancer care.",Leveraging machine learning to improve risk prediction for chemotherapy inducedneuropathy,10364532,R01CA249127,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Awareness ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Breast ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Decision Making ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' services research ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Numbness ', ' Loss of Sensation ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Peripheral Nervous System Diseases ', ' PNS Diseases ', ' Peripheral Nerve Diseases ', ' Peripheral Nervous System Disorders ', ' Peripheral Neuropathy ', ' Platinum ', ' Platinum Black ', ' Pt element ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Savings ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' survivorship ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Vinca Alkaloids ', ' Vinca Alkaloid Compound ', ' Adjuvant Chemotherapy ', ' Adjuvant Drug Therapy ', ' Caring ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' taxane ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' analog ', ' Oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' neuropathic ', ' Neuropathy ', ' Treatment Period ', ' treatment days ', ' treatment duration ', ' experience ', ' math ability ', ' math achievement ', ' math competence ', ' math competency ', ' math proficiency ', ' mathematic ability ', ' mathematic achievement ', ' mathematic compentence ', ' mathematic compentency ', ' mathematic proficiency ', ' mathematical achievement ', ' mathematical compentence ', ' mathematical compentency ', ' mathematical proficiency ', ' number sense ', ' numeracy ', ' proficient in math ', ' quantitative literacy ', ' mathematical ability ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer-directed therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' cancer care ', ' cancer epidemiology ', ' Provider ', ' fall risk ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Dose-Limiting ', ' Motor ', ' Cancer Survivorship ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Community Health ', ' community-based health ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' chemotherapy induced neuropathy ', ' care systems ', ' care services ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer type ', ' cancer invasiveness ', ' Impairment ', ' neurotoxicity ', ' neuron toxicity ', ' neuronal toxicity ', ' chemotherapy ', ' high risk ', ' community based practice ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy ', ' treatment choice ', ' associated symptom ', ' co-morbid symptom ', ' co-occuring symptom ', ' comorbid symptom ', ' concurrent symptom ', ' cooccuring symptom ', ' symptom association ', ' symptom comorbidity ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' side effect ', ' medication safety ', ' drug safety ', ' pharmaceutical safety ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,689634,CA-18
"The Wilmer Institute Mentored Clinician Scientist Scholar Program-Supplement PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Artificial intelligence (AI), in the form of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), has revolutionized the field of medicine, especially in subspecialties with access to a large number of images, such as ophthalmology. While promising, the application of ML/AI in ophthalmology is limited by the lack of clear guidelines on how to extract ophthalmic data, convert these data into a form that is usable for ML/AI model training and ensure these data are adhering to the principles of FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse). Our proposal aims to address these limitations by delineating the best practices for data curation via an online lecture series that will be available free of charge to the public, once the curriculum is assessed and validated by another academic institution (Harvard/Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary). If successful, the proposal will be impactful, as it will:  1. Accelerate reproducible research in ML/AI by enabling the creation of  standardized ML/AI-ready and FAIR datasets.  2. Disseminate the best practices in data curation beyond Johns Hopkins University  (JHU), as the online lectures will be made free of charge to the public.  3. Foster the creation of standardized multi-institutional datasets that will improve  both performance and generalizability of ML/AI algorithms in ophthalmology, by  enabling federated learning approaches and external validation of models. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our proposal aims to develop an online lecture series, which educates clinician- scientists on making ophthalmic data ML/AI-ready and adherent to FAIR principles. We will focus on clinical and imaging databases that are frequently used in ophthalmology, including Epic, Zeiss FORUM, and Heidelberg HEYEX. We will administer post-lecture quizzes to verify learning and reinforce fundamental concepts. To assess course relevance across various academic settings, we will deploy and test the same curriculum at a different academic institution. After making any necessary modifications, we plan to make this online course available to the public free of charge.",The Wilmer Institute Mentored Clinician Scientist Scholar Program-Supplement,10405937,K12EY015025,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Charge ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Ear ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Institutes ', ' Learning ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Ophthalmology ', ' Research ', ' Standardization ', ' Universities ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Guidelines ', ' improved ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Fostering ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' lectures ', ' Scientist ', ' Performance ', ' Modeling ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Scholars Program ', ' NCI Scholars Program ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Validation ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' FAIR principles ', ' FAIR data ', ' FAIR guiding principles ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable ', ' deep learning ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' data curation ', ' ']",NEI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K12,2021,86390,MD-07
"Clinical markers of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome: onset, severity and longitudinal neurodevelopmental outcome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This is an administrative supplement to our existing NIDA-funded grant entitled “Clinical markers of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome: onset, severity and longitudinal neurodevelopmental outcome” (R01DA049755). Every 15 minutes in the United States, an infant is born exposed to opioids, many of which develop the difficult to treat drug withdrawal syndrome, Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome (NOWS). Unfortunately, the diagnosis of NOWS is highly subjective and includes “high pitched cry” simply based on the nurse’s judgement. The objective measurement of the acoustic characteristics of the cry in babies with NOWS is a pivotal component of the Specific Aims of the active award for this Administrative Supplement entitled “Clinical markers of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome: onset, severity and longitudinal neurodevelopmental outcome” (R01DA049755): Aim 1: Determine neurobehavioral, cry, prenatal opioid and other substance exposure measured via maternal hair, and sociodemographic predictors of NOWS onset and severity. Aim 2: Evaluate the predictive validity of these clinical markers and test whether NOWS severity predicts neurodevelopment impairment at 6 and 18 months. We developed a computer-based cry analyzer that extracts the acoustic features of an infant’s cry. We used the cry analyzer to determine the acoustic characteristics of the cries of babies with NOWS and developed a NOWS cry “signature” that can identify which babies develop NOWS with a 91% accuracy rate. However, the cry technology that we developed is not usable at the bedside. The Specific Aim of this Administrative Supplement Is to develop a cloud-based system for the automated analysis of infant cry acoustical characteristics for the diagnosis of NOWS. The proposed software will enable us to have a fully automatic system, where a user records a baby cry in the newborn nursery using a phone or other connected device, and within a few seconds, receives the diagnostic result. This Administrative Supplement will provide the cloud-based software to change clinical practice by providing a more accurate and reliable diagnosis of NOWS which will affect the pharmacological treatment of NOWS including length of hospital stay and potentially improve the long-term outcome of these infants. PROJECT NARRATIVE The opioid epidemic has resulted in an alarming increase in the number of newborn babies who suffer drug withdrawal (NOWS or Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome). We will develop a cloud-based software system for the accurate diagnosis of NOWS and improve the management, health and development of these babies.","Clinical markers of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome: onset, severity and longitudinal neurodevelopmental outcome",10405202,R01DA049755,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Affect ', ' Award ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Clinical Markers ', ' Computers ', ' Crying ', ' Diagnosis ', ' gastrointestinal system ', ' Ailmentary System ', ' Alimentary System ', ' Digestive System ', ' Gastrointestinal Body System ', ' Gastrointestinal Organ System ', ' Grant ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Infant ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Newborns ', ' newborn child ', ' newborn children ', ' Judgment ', ' Laboratories ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Manuals ', ' Morphine ', ' Infumorph ', ' Kadian ', ' MS Contin ', ' MSir ', ' Morphia ', ' Oramorph ', ' Oramorph SR ', ' Roxanol ', ' Statex SR ', ' Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome ', ' Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome ', ' Neonatal Substance Withdrawal ', ' Neonatal Withdrawal Syndrome ', ' newborn abstinence syndrome ', ' Noise ', ' Nurseries ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Nursing Records ', ' Records ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Substance Withdrawal Syndrome ', ' Withdrawal Syndrome ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Weaning ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Withdrawal Symptom ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' drug withdrawal ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Training ', ' Opioid ', ' Opiates ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Exposure to ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Hour ', ' Severities ', ' System ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' Devices ', ' Sampling ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Symptoms ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Pharmacological Treatment ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' software systems ', ' fetal opioid exposure ', ' fetal opiate exposures ', ' gestational opiate exposure ', ' gestational opioid exposure ', ' prenatal opiate exposure ', ' prenatal opioid exposure ', ' prenatally opiate exposed ', ' Outcome ', ' Impairment ', ' infant outcome ', ' clinical practice ', ' cloud based ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' application programming interface ', ' application program interface ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' opiate crisis ', ' opioid crisis ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' automated analysis ', ' sociodemographic predictors ', ' socio-demographic predictors ', ' ']",NIDA,WOMEN AND INFANTS HOSPITAL-RHODE ISLAND,R01,2021,175593,RI-02
"Non invasive vagal nerve stimulation in opioid use disorders Opioid addiction is a major crisis of epidemic proportions and drug overdose is now the leading cause of accidental death in the United States. Treatment of Opioid Use Disorders (OUDs) includes medications with effects on opioid receptors such as buprenorphine, but access is limited for many patients. Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist that has been shown in recent studies to be equivalent in efficacy to buprenorphine. Initiation of treatment with long-acting naltrexone, however, requires a period of abstinence of about seven days during which time patients suffer from intense symptoms of withdrawal with a risk of relapse that can lead to overdose-related death. Opioids have an inhibitory effect on norepinephrine and the sympathetic nervous system, and many symptoms of withdrawal are driven by rebound activation of these systems. Dopaminergic systems in brain areas including ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens) and medial prefrontal cortex (anterior cingulate) play an important role in opioid addiction, craving and relapse, as do increases in inflammation. This project will assess a form of neuromodulation involving non-invasive electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve that may play a useful role during the period of opioid withdrawal before the initiation of long-term naltrexone treatment in blocking norepinephrine, sympathetic, and inflammatory responses and enhancing peripheral parasympathetic and central brain function in areas modulating drug craving (ventral striatum, anterior cingulate). Our preliminary data on the effects of non-invasive Vagal Nerve Stimulation (nVNS) on stress response in traumatized human subjects and patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) show that nVNS reliably blocks peripheral sympathetic and enhances parasympathetic function, reduces inflammatory responses (interleukin-6, or IL-6), and enhances central brain responses (anterior cingulate) to stress. We now propose to apply this technology to the treatment of patients with OUDs. Following verification using modelling and determination of optimal dosing parameters, we will use these parameters to assess effects of nVNS versus sham stimulation on opioid craving, peripheral autonomic, cardiovascular, inflammatory, and brain functional responses measured with High-Resolution Positron Emission Tomography (HR-PET) and radiolabeled water to videos of drug cues in recently treated patients with OUDs. Based on the outcome of this research, we will proceed to the UH3 phase, which will involve a randomized, sham-controlled trial of nVNS in patients with OUDs during the one to two week period of opioid withdrawal followed by assessment of craving, HR-PET imaging of both brain function and brain dopaminergic function, and assessment of peripheral autonomic, cardiovascular and inflammatory responses in conjunction with administration of nVNS or sham. We hypothesize that nVNS will reduce opioid craving and inflammatory, peripheral autonomic and cardiovascular responses and enhance brain responses (anterior cingulate function and dopamine function in ventral striatum), and promote successful conversion to long-acting naltrexone, in patients with OUDs. Project Narrative Opioid use disorders (OUDs) have been associated with a 4-fold increase in drug overdose deaths in the past decade, and current treatments including medications that block the opioid receptor require a withdrawal period during which time many patients relapse and tragically may overdose and die. This project will assess a new device, non-invasive Vagal Nerve Stimulation (nVNS), that does not require surgery or implantation, and that electrically stimulates the vagus nerve as it passes through the neck, dampening the sympathetic nervous system and modulating brain regions in a way that may help patients during the opioid withdrawal period and reduce relapse. Studying the effects of nVNS on opioid craving and brain and physiological responses in patients with OUDs has the potential to reduce relapse and save lives, as well as increase our knowledge of changes to the brain and physiology that underlie OUDs and successful response to treatment.",Non invasive vagal nerve stimulation in opioid use disorders,10376890,UG3DA048502,"['Brain ', ' Brain

"CPS: AutoWean: Foundations of Autonomous Medical CPS for Mechanical Ventilation Weaning   While mechanical ventilators provide life-saving respiratory support, prolonged acute mechanical ventilation (PAMV) can lead to severe complications (e.g. , pneumonia) and increased healthcare costs - predicted to be over $32 billion in 2020 and accounting for over 10% of all hospital costs. Thus, mechanical ventilation needs to be discontinued as early as possible, often by using a process known as ""weaning"". However, the best approach to weaning remains an open question and is subject to controversy, where estimated 170,000 preventable deaths per year in US intensive care units are a result of inappropriate ventilator weaning. Consequently, the Emergency Care Research Institute (ECRI) lists improper ventilator settings as a Top 10 Health Technology Hazard in 2019.  Autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning exemplifies a medical cyber-physical systems (MCPS) that requires collections of interconnected medical devices (e.g., ventilators and patient monitors) that are coordinated for treating a patient (i.e. , performing safe autonomous weaning). This proposal aims to develop fundamental advances in safe and effective data-driven context-aware human-in-the-loop control that will enable autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning . While closed-loop control and data-driven techniques (e.g., system identification and machine learning) have been applied to MCPS, assuring the safety and reliability of using data-driven components that adapt in-the-loop with a human operator remains a challenge. We will demonstrate the impact of our closed-loop design and analysis techniques in autonomous MCPS for mechanical ventilation weaning .  The proposed project directly aligns with the mission of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) through the research and development of new technologies to advance medical care through medical device interoperability and clinical decision support for enabling autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning. Also relevant to the NIBIB mission, achieving the aims of this project requires a multidisciplinary approach and complementary advances in computer science and clinical care. From the healthcare perspective, this project will offer evidence-based and personalized decision support to caregivers for better mechanical ventilation weaning. The long-term impact of autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning pain will lead to shorter hospital stays, reduce the economic burden of health care, and reduce the deadly side effects of inappropriate weaning. This project concerns development of technologies to quantify and enable autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning , where, currently, the best approach to weaning remains an open question and is subject to controversy.

"A Personalized, Patient-Centered Approach to Optimizing Lupus Care Candidate: April Jorge, MD is an Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and an Assistant in Medicine in the Rheumatology Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). After graduating from the University of Maryland magna cum laude, she received her MD from Georgetown University, and she completed her internal medicine residency at Northwestern University. She completed her rheumatology fellowship at MGH, during which she also completed the Harvard Catalyst Clinical and Translational Research Academy and began working with Hyon Choi, MD, DrPH. Dr. Jorge's prior work has resulted in 15 peer- reviewed original papers, with 13 as the first author or co-first author. Her goal is to become an independent investigator and innovative leader in patient-oriented research of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Mentorship, Training Activities, and Environment: Dr. Jorge will conduct the proposed project at MGH under the mentorship of Hyon Choi, MD, DrPH and co-mentorship of Karen Costenbader, MD, MPH and Karen Sepucha, PhD. Dr. Choi is a world-renowned, NIH-funded physician scientist in advanced clinical epidemiology of rheumatic conditions, ranging from common disorders to rare but serious disorders (e.g., SLE). He has served as a mentor for several prior K awardees. Dr. Costenbader is a clinical investigator and expert in SLE who is also an experienced mentor of K awardees. Dr. Sepucha is a leading expert in patient-centered decision science. Dr. Jorge's research will also benefit from the specific expertise of her key collaborators, including advanced clinical epidemiology methods, machine learning prediction algorithms, and decision- analytic modeling. In addition to receiving excellent mentorship, she will acquire new skills through didactics in advanced clinical epidemiology and pharmacoepidemiology, risk prediction, eliciting patient preferences with a mixed methods research approach, and decision-analytic modeling. Research: SLE carries increased risks of multiple comorbidities and double the risk of death compared to the general population. Current treatment is limited in part by few proven medications and adverse treatment effects. The central goal of this research is to improve long-term SLE outcomes by integrating personalized risks of potential harms and benefits with patient preferences to guide the personalized, patient-centered use of key lupus medications. To achieve this goal, she will risk stratify patients for potential harms of treatment, i.e., hydroxychloroquine retinopathy and infection with belimumab use versus other immunosuppressants, and other adverse outcomes, i.e., severe COVID-19 infection (Aim 1). She will elicit patient preferences for SLE treatment through a discrete choice experiment (Aim 2a) and will integrate patient preferences with personalized risks through a multi-criteria decision analysis to determine the optimal hydroxychloroquine dose in SLE care (Aim 2b). Completion of this proposal and training plan will position Dr. Jorge with the vital experience to become an independent clinical investigator in patient-oriented research of SLE. Project Narrative Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a heterogeneous systemic condition associated with serious morbidity and premature mortality, yet treatment options are limited. There is uncertainty regarding the optimal use of the two FDA-approved lupus medications, hydroxychloroquine and belimumab, due in part to the risks of adverse treatment effects including hydroxychloroquine retinopathy and infection. This Career Development Award focuses on applying advanced clinical epidemiology and patient-centered decision science to integrate personalized risks of potential harms and benefits with patient preferences to guide the personalized, patient- centered use of key lupus medications, including specifically the optimal dose of hydroxychloroquine in SLE care.","A Personalized, Patient-Centered Approach to Optimizing Lupus Care",10192142,K23AR079040,"['Academy ', ' Award ', ' Azathioprine ', ' Azothioprine ', ' Immuran ', ' Imuran ', ' Imurel ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Decision Analysis ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Fellowship ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' General Hospitals ', ' Hydroxychloroquine ', ' Hydroxychlorochin ', ' Oxychlorochin ', ' Oxychloroquine ', ' Immunosuppressive Agents ', ' Immunosuppressants ', ' Immunosuppressive drug ', ' Immunosuppressive treatment ', ' immune suppressive agent ', ' immune suppressor ', ' immunosuppressive substance ', ' immunosuppressor ', ' Infection ', ' Internal Medicine ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ', ' Lupus Erythematosus Disseminatus ', ' SLE ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematous ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythmatosus ', ' disseminated lupus erythematosus ', ' systemic lupus erythematosis ', ' Maryland ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Methotrexate ', ' Methotrexate Methylaminopterin ', ' Methotrexatum ', ' Metotrexato ', ' Morbidity -

"Opioid effects on cognition and addiction: Molecular underpinnings Project Summary Opioid overdoses kill more than 130 Americans every day, yielding over 47,500 deaths per year, and the same number of deaths in the 9/11 attacks every 23 days. The best treatments for opioid use disorder (OUD) are medication-assisted therapies such as methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone, and are inadequate to buttress the epidemic. Failure to treat OUD is sourced in not understanding the molecular pathophysiology of OUD, including its clinical manifestations as a biological, psychological, and behavioral disease, the neurobiological mechanisms that reinforce its consumption, and how repeated consumption affects other neurocognitive processes. The Hurd lab recently discovered a genomic locus associated with OUD, downstream of the protein tyrosine-kinase FYN, in striatal neurons from human heroin abusers. Additionally, heroin increased Fyn expression in the striatum of rats that undergo heroin self-administration (SA), and in primary striatal neuronal cultures. FYN phosphorylates tau, and hyperphosphorylation of tau is known to precede neurofibrillary tangles, a hallmark of neurocognitive disease. This proposal leverages high-throughput electronic medical records (EMR) from the Mount Sinai Health System to examine how chronic opioid exposure affects the odds of neurocognitive disease (NCD) on a population level, and EMR from two other hospitals at Columbia University and the University of San Francisco to replicate these effects, using the same analysis pipeline. Additionally, I propose mechanistic studies of Fyn overexpression in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), a region known to be affected in NCD and OUD, on heroin SA and cognitive behaviors using animal models. Further, I used a machine learning approach with RNA-seq data obtained from human post-mortem OFC tissue to classify subjects as either belonging to the heroin overdose or control group based on the expression of ~10 genes. Three feature (gene) importance metrics highlighted a transcript, SHISA7, that was reduced in the human OFC, and this finding was replicated in the OFC of rats that underwent heroin self-administration. SHISA7 and FYN both regulate the synaptic function of AMPA receptors, and are components of the post-synaptic density of glutamatergic neurons. I will examine the impact of overexpressing SHISA7, identified using this machine learning approach, in the OFC on heroin SA and cognitive behaviors in animal models. Finally, I will conduct RNA-sequencing experiments on the OFC from Fyn- and Shisa7-manipulated animals, and in downstream bioinformatics analyses, parse key drivers of gene networks to identify potential mechanisms that account for the contribution of these genes to heroin SA and cognitive behaviors. High-throughput clinical and gene expression data from the human can inform translational, mechanistic studies using animal models that will enable a far-reaching understanding of the molecular disturbances underlying the effects of opioids on cognition and addiction. Project Narrative The opioid epidemic is killing over 130 Americans every day, and current treatments consist of opioid substitution therapies, which are fraught with challenges and ineffective at slowing the epidemic. Opioid use disorder is a biological, psychological, and behavioral disease, and our scientific understanding of it must proceed along multiple dimensions of analysis to elucidate its underlying molecular pathophysiology, with the end goal of formulating novel treatments. This project will gain insights into the molecular underpinnings of how opioids affect cognition and addiction, starting from high-throughput human studies using advanced computational methods, proceeding to mechanistic studies using animal models of reversal learning and heroin self-administration behaviors, and further through deep sequencing and bioinformatics studies to characterize gene networks and key drivers impacted by opioid exposure.",Opioid effects on cognition and addiction: Molecular underpinnings,10150982,F31DA051183,"['Affect ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ',

"Optimizing Surveillance and Treatment for Control of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis OVERVIEW SUMMARY Our TMRC program “Optimizing surveillance and treatment for control of cutaneous leishmaniasis”constitutes a concerted transdisciplinary and intersectorialeffort to address fundamental constraints on the control of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Colombia and the Latin American Region. Control of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis is centered on case identification and treatment. However, the dispersed distribution of the populations at risk, underreporting, unavailability of information on the effectiveness of treatments administered, and increasing rates of treatment failure and evidence of drug resistance to the few available antileishmanial drugs undermine and subvert control efforts. The Goal of the TMRC “Optimizing Surveillance and Treatment for Control of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis” will be developed at three inter-related levels of response to treatment: Host innate responses affecting outcome of treatment and corresponding biomarkers; Parasite-dependent factors in drug susceptibility and therapeutic outcome; Active detection of affected Communities, cases and treatment follow-up.  1. To address critical knowledge gaps in the targeting and evaluation of interventions for control of  cutaneous leishmaniasis.  2. To determine the relation of parasite susceptibility to anti-leishmanial drugs with the clinical and  parasitological response to standard-of-care treatment, and parasite factors defining this relationship.  3. Identify innate host functions that contribute to cure or failure during antileishmanial drug therapy and  their related biomarkers. This Center Program will be developed by a multidisciplinary team of national and international investigators that includes recognized experts, mid-career and new investigators in the relevant fields: Epidemiology, Vector Ecology, Molecular Biology and Genomics, Immunology and Cell Biology. The Principal Investigators and Core Leaders have already worked together successfully. Each brings high level specialized capacities to the corresponding projects and together, provide a broad scope of vision to the TMRC. Each Research Project will contribute to more effective control by addressing information and knowledge gaps and barriers to opportune, appropriate treatment to achieve cure, decrease the risk of relapse and by providing information and tools to reduce the prevalence and consequences of cutaneous leishmaniasis. CIDEIM is a WHO Collaborating Center for Leishmaniasis since 1992. The scope and focus of proposed TMRC program on the optimization of surveillance and treatment will be synergistic with our role as a WHOCC allowing the TMRC research and training program to channel and amplify capacity building within the Region and to translate findings to the competent national authorities OVERVIEW NARRATIVE Control of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis is centered on case identification and treatment.

"Improving the measurement and analysis of long-term, patient-centered outcomes following acute respiratory failure PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This Pathway to Independence Award application is submitted by a pulmonary and critical care epidemiologist committed to improving the quality of patient-oriented research for patients experiencing acute respiratory failure (ARF). Worldwide, millions of patients develop ARF annually. In the U.S., nearly one million patients with ARF require mechanical ventilation annually, accounting for a quarter of all intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. As improvements in ICU care reduce such patients’ in-hospital mortality rates, attention has shifted to the challenges ARF survivors face in regaining their prior cognitive, physical, and psychosocial functioning. However, there is a key barrier for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) testing new interventions to improve ARF survivorship – that is, the current lack of an endpoint that (1) captures long-term patient dispositions, (2) incorporates patient preferences and perspectives, and (3) is able to be analyzed without concern for statistical biases. The overarching goal of this research is to support clinical innovation by developing new approaches to measure and report long-term patient-centered outcomes that overcome the methodological barriers currently limiting ARF RCTs. The applicant will accomplish his goals under the mentorship of established researchers in critical care, patient-centered outcomes research, statistics, and informatics to assure his transition to a tenure-track faculty position in the R00 phase and his emergence as a leading pulmonary and critical care epidemiologist. First, the applicant will use an innovative combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods to elicit and integrate ARF survivors’ and their caregivers’ perspectives into a new patient-centered, long-term composite outcome measure (K99 phase). During the R00 phase, the applicant will recruit ARF survivors to participate in a prospective cohort, and follow these patients to describe the burden of ARF survivorship over 1-year using the new endpoint developed during the K99 phase. This endeavor will also provide key data that will facilitate sample size calculations in future ARF RCTs. Data from this cohort will additionally be used to develop an electronic health record (EHR)-based algorithm to predict risks for adverse long-term outcomes among ARF patients early in their ICU stays. Thus, this K99/R00 will augment ARF research by establishing a new outcome measure anchored in patient perspectives, improving the understanding and clinical prognostication of post-ICU morbidity following ARF, and facilitate the efficiency and clinical relevance of future ARF RCTs by enabling measurement of patients’ baseline risks for different outcomes. Concurrently, the didactic work, individual study, and hands-on learning in mixed-methods research, natural language processing, and predictive analytics will fill key training gaps for the applicant, thereby positioning him for a successful, independently-funded research career advancing the science of outcomes measurement and analysis for ARF RCTs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Randomized trials testing strategies to improve long-term outcomes for survivors of acute respiratory failure (ARF) are hampered by the lack of valid, patient-centered endpoints. Using interviews with ARF survivors and their caregivers, statistical simulation, consensus building among stakeholders, and a prospective cohort study, the applicant will develop, describe the epidemiology of, and predict a new patient-oriented outcome that will support trials of innovative approaches to improve ARF survivorship outcomes.","Improving the measurement and analysis of long-term, patient-centered outcomes following acute respiratory failure",10064003,R00HL141678,"['Accounting ', ' Algorithms ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Critical Care ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Faculty ', ' Financial Support ', ' financial assistance ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Interview ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Monte Carlo Method ', ' Monte Carlo algorithm ', ' Monte Carlo calculation ', ' Monte Carlo procedure ', ' Monte Carlo simulation ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' statistics ', ' survivorship ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Hospital Mortality ', ' In-house Mortalities ', ' Inhospital Mortality ', ' Competence ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Mechanical ventilation ', ' mechanical respiratory assist ', ' mechanically ventilated ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Survivors ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' residence ', ' residential building ', ' residential site ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Acute respiratory failure ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' cognitive function ', ' Physical Function ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Informatics ', ' Statistical Bias ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' Reporting ', ' Regaine ', ' Rogaine ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' patient oriented study ', ' patient oriented research ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' high risk ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' hands-on learning ', ' applied learning ', ' interactive engagement ', ' interactive learning ', ' tenure track ', ' tenure process ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' Prospective cohort study ', ' recruit ', ' care outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' structured data ', ' unstructured data ', ' ventilation ', ' emotional functioning ', ' patient health information ', ' patient health record ', ' patient medical record ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R00,2021,249000,PA-03
"SimTK: An Ecosystem for Data and Model Sharing in the Biomechanics Community Physics-based simulations provide a powerful framework for understanding biological form and function. They harmonize heterogeneous experimental data with real-world physical constraints, helping researchers understand biological systems as they engineer novel drugs, new diagnostics, medical devices, and surgical interventions. The rise in new sensors and simulation tools is generating an increasing amount of data, but this data is often inaccessible, preventing reuse and limiting scientific progress. In 2005, we launched SimTK, a website to develop and share biosimulation tools, models, and data, to address these issues. SimTK now supports 62,000+ researchers globally and 950+ projects. Members use it to meet their grants’ data sharing responsibilities; experiment with new ways of collaborating; and build communities around their datasets and tools. However, challenges remain: many researchers still do not share their digital assets due to the time needed to prepare, document, and maintain those assets, and since SimTK hosts a growing number of diverse digital assets, the site now also faces the challenge of making these assets discoverable and reusable. Thus, we propose a plan to extend SimTK and implement new solutions to promote scientific data sharing and reuse. First, we will maintain the reliable, user-friendly foundation upon which SimTK is built, continuing to provide the excellent support our members expect and supporting the site’s existing features for sharing and building communities. Second, we will implement methods to establish a culture of model and data sharing in the biomechanics community. We will encourage researchers to adopt new habits, making sharing part of their workflow, by enabling the software and systems they use to automatically upload models and data to SimTK via an application programming interface (API) and by recruiting leading researchers in the community to serve as beta testers and role models. Third, we will create tools to easily replicate and extend biomechanics simulations. Containers and cloud computing services allow researchers to capture and share a snapshot of their computing environment, enabling unprecedented fidelity in sharing. We will integrate these technologies into SimTK and provide custom, easy-to-use interfaces to replicate and extend simulation studies. Lastly, we will develop a metadata standard for models and data for the biomechanics community, increasing reusability and discoverability of the rich set of resources shared on SimTK. We will use the new standard on SimTK and fill in the metadata fields automatically using natural language processing and machine learning, minimizing the burden and inaccuracies of manual metadata entry. We will evaluate our success in achieving these aims by tracking the number of assets shared and the frequency they are used as a springboard to new research. These changes will accelerate biomechanics research and provide new tools to increase the reusability and impact of shared resources. By lowering barriers to data sharing in the biosimulation community, SimTK will continue to serve as a model for how to create national infrastructure for scientific subdisciplines. SimTK is a vibrant hub for the development and sharing of simulation software, data, and models of biological structures and processes. SimTK-based resources are being used to design medical devices and drugs, to generate new diagnostics, to create surgical interventions, and to provide insights into biology. The proposed enhancements to SimTK will accelerate progress in the field by lowering barriers to and standardizing data and model sharing, thus 1) increasing the quantity and also, importantly, the quality of resources that researchers share and 2) enabling others to reproduce and build on the wealth of past biomechanics research studies.",SimTK: An Ecosystem for Data and Model Sharing in the Biomechanics Community,10085652,R01GM124443,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Biology ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Communities ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Explosion ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Habits ', ' Literature ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Device Designs ', ' Medical Device ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Physics ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' role model ', ' sensor ', ' Site ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' Data Files ', ' Letters ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' Frequencies ', ' System ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Documentation ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Security ', ' Update ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' digital ', ' software systems ', ' Consumption ', ' user-friendly ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' biological systems ', ' complex biological systems ', ' data sharing ', ' simulation software ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' cloud computer ', ' biomechanical model ', ' biomechanic modeling ', ' biomechanic simulation ', ' biomechanical modeling ', ' biomechanical simulation ', ' application programming interface ', ' application program interface ', ' community building ', ' data access ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', ' data cleaning ', ' data cleansing ', ' data ecosystem ', ' data sharing ecosystem ', ' data standards ', ' data standardization ', ' data reuse ', ' data re-use ', ' metadata standards ', ' ']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,489919,CA-18
"Assessing the power of primary drug-screens to predict clinical response. PROJECT SUMMARY Precision oncology relies on the hypothesis that further characterizing a patient's tumor will lead to better predictions of treatment response. While this approach effectively breaks diagnoses into smaller and smaller subtypes likely to respond to a given targeted inhibitor, the downside is it results in highly fragmented clinical data spread across multiple treatment arms. The more progress the field makes in assigning new therapies, the harder it will be to accrue adequate sample size to test another therapy. Direct screening of cancer cell lines and primary samples on panels of targeted inhibitors is a uniquely promising approach to this problem, turning every patient sample into a hundred mini experiments, but clinical validation of in vitro drug-response predictions have been hampered by limited numbers of patients who are screened and actually treated with any given drug. Such an evaluation is critical to determine the predictive value gained from drug screening of patient samples. Over the past seven years the Knight Cancer Institute has performed drug screening paired alongside genomic and/or RNA sequencing for over 600 primary leukemic samples. Within two years, we will have accumulated over 200 patients not only screened for in vitro drug response but then treated with matched targeted inhibitors. I will leverage this existing and growing dataset to interrogate the power of in vitro drug screening data to predict clinical response using retrospective data. I will establish a robust framework for primary drug screening and analysis, build interpretable models for clinical decision making, and explore mechanisms controlling drug response. This project will result in improvements to high-throughput drug screening, a thorough accounting of the predictive power of in vitro drug screening, and candidates for treatment combinations in resistant tumors. My goal is to become an independent investigator and cross-disciplinary leader in patient sample multi-omic profiling, targeted therapy selection, and translational oncology. During my mentored phase I will be receiving guidance from Dr. Emek Demir, an expert in computational modeling of systems biology, Dr. Jeffery Tyner, a leader in patient sample drug screening and validation, and Dr. Brian Druker, a pioneer of targeted cancer therapy and director of the Knight Cancer Institute. I will also improve my statistical understanding of complex systems by working with my advisory committee member Dr Tomi Mori, learn to integrate large datasets and predicting patient outcomes from Dr. Shannon McWeeney, and improve upon existing drug screening platforms and analysis methods with Dr. Laura Heiser. I am determined to attain an independent faculty position and my mentors have committed to assisting me in the application and transition process. PROJECT NARRATIVE A promising field of cancer treatment is targeted therapy, where each patient is prescribed different drugs precisely based on the features of their cancer. We have a large dataset of patients where we tested drugs on their cancer cells in the lab, and later the patient received the same drug as part of their therapy. I will investigate the best methods for testing drugs on each patient's cancer, how effective these tests are for predicting how well a treatment will work in each patient, and why some patients don't

"Personalized Management of Intracranial Aneurysms Using Computer-aided Analytics Abstract The primary objective is to develop an artificial intelligence-centric, quantitative and noninvasive software platform that can be integrated into 3D angiographic scanners (DSA, CTA or MRA) to provide guidance regarding the diagnosis and management of intracranial aneurysms (IA). Hemorrhagic stroke secondary to ruptured IAs leads to significant morbidity and mortality and affects over 35,000 patients on a yearly basis in the United States. The diagnosis of asymptomatic IAs is on the rise with the increasing use of cerebral imaging. However, guidance regarding which aneurysms should be treated has not advanced. Leveraging recent advances in computational science and technology, particularly artificial intelligence, the proposed software platform built on two enabling technologies can (1) propel automated “patient-specific” hemodynamic evaluations into the clinical workflow and (2) conduct “data-driven” risk assessments of IA rupture on an individual basis. Specific research aims are to (1) develop a clinically-oriented CFD platform that enables automated “patient-specific” hemodynamic evaluations of IAs, (2) investigate data-driven analytics toward prediction of rupture risk for IAs and (3) evaluate the data-driven analytics in a blind study. Once validated, a follow-up R01 project is planned to examine the clinical utility of the proposed software platform in a prospective clinical study as a single gateway for computer-aided evaluation of cerebral aneurysms. Public Health Relevance/Narrative This R01 proposal is to investigate the feasibility of developing an innovative, non-invasive and artificial intelligence-centric tool that can be used as a software add-on to clinical angiographic (e.g. DSA) scanners.

"Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools PROJECT SUMMARY  Epilepsy is one of the world’s most prevalent diseases, yet the rate of uncontrolled seizures has not changed in decades. One of the reasons for this is our limited understanding of seizure mechanisms, and so one of the main goals of epilepsy research is to identify new biomarkers to help us understand the nature of the disease. Recent technological advancements now allow us to monitor brain activity with much higher resolution, which have led to the identification of promising potential biomarkers such as High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs). Unfortunately, clinicians still have not determined how to utilize this information under clinical conditions. There are three main obstacles to implementing HFOs in practice: 1) they are difficult to find; 2) it is unclear how to ascertain which HFOs are truly related to epilepsy; and 3) it is unclear how to use the HFO data in a prospective fashion to improve clinical care. The purpose of this project is overcome each of these obstacles. In the past funding period, we developed and validated an HFO detection algorithm that overcomes the first obstacle, and allowed us acquire a massive database of HFOs that have opened new avenues of research. In this proposal, we will leverage that algorithm to move HFOs towards clinical translation. In the first Aim, we apply advanced functional connectivity techniques to quantify the network properties of HFOs. Our data, which comprise HFOs from the entire hospitalization and fully curated metadata, are ideal for robust analyses of this new area of HFO research. The second Aim addresses a longstanding, and still unsolved problem in HFO research: how to discern when HFOs are due to epileptic processes versus normal physiology? Our past funding period identified some potential methods to identify pathological HFOs, but also crucial caveats that must be addressed prior to clinical implementation. This Aim will combine multiple classification methods with state-of-the-art machine learning tools to distinguish epileptic from normal HFOs. It will also conduct a large human expert classification of HFOs using clinical EEG software, to start involving epilepsy clinicians in the direct evaluation of HFOs. The third Aim will further develop the translational potential of HFOs, incorporating our unique longitudinal clinical data to characterize the effects of medications, sleep, and other time-varying effects on HFO rates. It will then incorporate these and all prior HFO data into a rigorous latent class model to predict how likely each channel is to be epileptic. These Aims together serve as the framework to establish HFOs as a clinically viable biomarker of seizures, allowing their translation into clinical epilepsy care and leading to future prospective clinical studies using HFOs to guide prospective clinical decisions. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to characterize a novel biomarker of seizures using advanced computer algorithms that monitor brainwaves in real time. These biomarkers, known as High Frequency Oscillations, have been recognized for some time but their research has been restricted to very short datasets within a handful of centers worldwide. This project will use Big Data tools to help translate these biomarkers into widespread use while exploring several novel ways in which they will help clinicians identify seizures.",Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools,10117719,R01NS094399,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Economics ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Engineering ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' High Frequency Oscillation ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Physiology ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Seizures ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Sleep ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Specificity ', ' Supervision ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' novel ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Single Seizures ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' technology/technique ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' prospective ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' clinical care ', ' novel marker ', ' new marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' clinical practice ', ' potential biomarker ', ' potential biological marker ', ' specific biomarkers ', ' clinical translation ', ' clinical implementation ', ' Big Data Methods ', ' Big Data Analytics ', ' Big Data Tools ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,512781,MI-12
"EEGLAB: Software for Analysis of Human Brain Dynamics Electroencephalography (EEG), the first function brain activity imaging modality, has several natural advantages over metabolic brain imaging modalities. EEG is noninvasive, low cost, and lightweight enough to be highly mobile. Two major shifts in scientific perspective on the nature and use of human electrophysiological data are now ongoing. The first is a shift to using EEG data as a source-resolved, relatively high-resolution cortical source imaging modality. The EEGLAB signal processing environment, an open source software project of the Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience (SCCN) of the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), began as a set of EEG data analysis running on Matlab (The Mathworks, Inc.) released by Makeig on the World Wide Web in 1997. EEGLAB was first released from SCCN in 2001. Now nearly twenty years later, the EEGLAB reference paper [4] has over 6,750 citations (now increasing by over 4 per day), the opt-in EEGLAB discussion email list links 6,000 researchers, the EEGLAB news list over 15,000 researchers, and an independent 2011 survey of 687 research respondents reported EEGLAB to be the software environment most widely used for electrophysiological data analysis in cognitive neuroscience. Our statistics show that after over the past four years, EEGLAB adoption is still growing steadily. Here, we will develop a framework for thorough comparison of preprocessing methods, and will apply machine learning methods on the large body of data collected by our laboratory to build optimized, automated data processing pipelines. We will greatly augment the power of the EEGLAB environment by providing a cross-study meta-analysis capability and will revise the software architecture to use a file and metadata organization compatible with the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) framework first developed for fMRI/MRI data archiving. These tools will integrate the HED annotating system allowing for meta-analysis across large corpus of studies. We will implement beamforming within EEGLAB. We will develop a hierarchical Bayesian framework for clustering effective sources on multiple measures across subjects and studies, and will develop tools to perform statistical testing on information flow measures at these scales. Although EEG and MEG recording have co- existed for four decades, little available software can combine both data types, recorded concurrently (`MEEG' data), to enhance source separation. We recently showed that ICA decomposition also allows joint MEEG effective source decomposition and will integrate MEG and joint MEEG data decomposition and imaging into the EEGLAB tool set. We will build tools to use MRI- and fMRI-derived anatomical atlases to inform the interpretation of EEG and MEG brain source dynamics. These radical improvements will further the use of non-invasive human electrophysiology for 3-D functional cortical brain imaging in the U.S. and worldwide, thereby accelerating progress in noninvasive basic and clinical human brain research using highly time- and space-resolved measures of brain electromagnetic dynamics. The EEGLAB signal processing environment is now used in many electrophysiological research and teaching laboratories worldwide. To accelerate progress in basic and clinical cognitive neuroscience, we will continue maintenance and development of the EEGLAB environment, introducing new tools for source separation and localization, source clustering, automatic artifact management, and across-studies meta-analysis, and will extend its scope to process magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and joint EEG/MEG data and to highlight parallels between EEG/MEG source dynamics and results of existing research using fMRI and other brain imaging.",EEGLAB: Software for Analysis of Human Brain

"Novel machine learning approaches for improving structural discrimination in cryo-electron tomography Project Summary Cellular cryo-electron tomography (Cryo-ET) has made possible the observation of cellular organelles and macromolecular complexes at nanometer resolution with native conformations. The rapid increasing amount of Cryo-ET data available however brings along some major challenges for analysis which we will timely ad- dress in this proposal. We will design novel data-driven machine learning algorithms for improving structural discrimination and resolution. In particular, we have the following speciﬁc aims: (1) We will develop a novel Autoencoder and Iterative region Matching (AIM) algorithm for marker-free alignment of image tilt-series to re- construct tomograms with improved resolution; (2) We will develop a saliency-based auto-picking algorithm for better detecting macromolecular complexes, and combine it with an innovative 2D-to-3D framework to further improve structure detection accuracy; (3) We will design an end-to-end convolutional model for pose-invariant clustering of subtomograms. This model will produce an initial clustering which will be reﬁned by a new subto- mogram averaging algorithm that automatically down-weights subtomograms of noise and little contribution; (4) We will perform experimental evaluations by using previously reported bacterial secretion systems and mito- chondrial ultrastructures datasets to improve the ﬁnal resolution. Implementing algorithms in Aims 1-3, we will develop a user-friendly open-source graphical user interface -tom to directly beneﬁt the scientiﬁc community.  -tom will be systematically compared with existing software including IMOD, EMAN2, and Relion on simulated and benchmark datasets. To facilitate distribution, -tom will be integrated into existing software platforms Sci- pion and TomoMiner. Our data-driven algorithms and software not only will facilitate and accelerate the future use of Cryo-ET, but also can be readily used on analyzing the existing large amounts of Cryo-ET data to im- prove our understanding of the structure, function, and spatial organization of macromolecular complexes in situ. Project Narrative This project will create a system of machine learning algorithms to accelerate and facilitate the use and re-use of the rapidly accumulating Cryo-ET datasets. For easy use, we will develop an open-source GUI -Tom (to be disseminated into the Scipion and TomoMiner software platforms) that streamlines the new approaches from the initial tomogram reconstruction step to the ﬁnal subtomogram averaging step.

"Digital Phenotyping of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease 1  2 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  3  4 One of the most critical gaps in management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the lack of effective  5 methods of early identification in the population. The objective of this study is to leverage data and analytics to  6 improve healthcare outcomes by early detection and risk stratification of NAFLD, before onset of liver-related  7 complications. Artificial intelligence applications in large electronic health records have the potential to identify  8 disease traits before onset of disease. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that targeted screening with  9 machine-learning models applied to large integrated healthcare datasets can identify individuals with NAFLD 10 and, more specifically, those with a progressive phenotype. We will test the central hypothesis in 2 specific 11 AIMs. First, we will train a machine learning model of NAFLD prediction using multiple longitudinal data points 12 of all health-care encounters of a well-characterized population-based cohort of individuals diagnosed with 13 NAFLD in reference to individuals without NAFLD from the general population. We hypothesize that 14 unsupervised machine learning can identify complex processes and patterns without a human's guidance and 15 discover early comorbidity clusters (“latent traits” present prior to NAFLD development) that reflect a phenotype 16 at risk to develop NAFLD later in life. Second, we will test and optimize the model for the prediction of patient 17 outcomes (development of cirrhosis, liver-related complications and death) in the NAFLD cohort. We 18 hypothesize that machine learning approaches could be used to further stratify patients into subgroups with 19 different disease trajectories, with the goal of identifying those individuals at risk of progressive NAFLD and 20 liver-related outcomes. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it expands the 21 analytical toolbox beyond conventional methods to identify individuals with NAFLD using all health-encounters 22 of a large, well-characterized population-based cohort with long follow-up. This proposal is significant because 23 it addresses a critical need of identification and management of the most prevalent chronic liver disease and 24 offers a practical solution to large scale implementation of screening and risk-stratification strategies using 25 routinely collected data. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to improve the population health in obesity- 26 associated diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will use innovative statistical methodology to improve the understanding of factors that predict an individual’s risk to develop nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and liver-related complications using routinely collected data available during the health care course of an individual. The development of effective and accessible tools to predict the risk of future development of liver disease will enable timely intervention to prevent the disease and reduce the burden of illness and mortality associated with obesity.

"A framework to stratify patient cohorts for clinical management PROJECT SUMMARY  Existing Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems have limited functionality to find patients that can benefit by particular interventions. Hence, clinicians are unable to proactively reach-out to these patients, leading to an ever-widening evidence-care gap. The goal of this proposal is to improve healthcare delivery. The objective is to develop a data-framework for accurately finding patients that can benefits from large/population scale interventions. We will investigate two dimensions for improving the patient search—increasing the resolution of the search (aim 1) and increasing the quality of the data that the search is performed on (aim 2). In aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that a rule-based model of the relevant clinical guideline, will find patients with higher accuracy than the conventional queries. The rational is that the rule-based approach will allow complex groupings of the eligibility criteria and will thereby provide a higher resolution of search than conventional query. In aim 2 we will investigate whether machine learning (ML) can improve the accuracy of patient data and contribute to the accuracy of search results obtained through the conventional query and the guideline rule-base. In addition to the above aims, in aim 3 we will automate deployment of the rule-base and ML models and minimize the manual effort for developing ML models. This proposal builds on the lipid management program at Brigham and Women's hospital (BWH). Our work will be focused on finding patients for lipid- management; however, our methodology and tooling will be generalizable to other medical areas and institutions. The study team includes national experts in cardiology, machine learning, health information technology (HIT) and open-source software development. We will create an open-source software platform (i2b2-ML) by extending the popular `Informatics for Integration Biology and the Bedside' (i2b2) platform that we have developed and supported over the past 10 years and that is used by over 200 medical centers. I2b2-ML will extend i2b2's proven ability to characterize patient cohorts for research into the clinical realm. Our study will yield methodology for accurately finding patients that can benefit by clinical intervention and will thereby enable cost-effectiveness of population programs. It will directly help scale the lipid management program at BWH to benefit a wider patient population. Our detailed characterization of the gaps in lipid management at a large healthcare system will potentially inform improvements in the lipid management guideline. The methodology and tooling developed in this project will be disseminated in open-source for potential incorporation in the clinical data infrastructure at other institutions, which will facilitate implementation of population-scale clinical programs across the nation. In addition, the resultant infrastructure will serve as a platform for development of artificial intelligence-based applications to improve clinical care. These outcomes are expected to have a positive impact on health care delivery so that more patients will get the optimal care.

"Early detection, containment, and management of COVID-19 in dialysis facilities using multi-modal data sources Abstract With older age and multiple comorbidities, dialysis patients are at high risk for serious complications, even death, from COVID-19. There is a large disproportionate representation of minorities, especially Blacks and Hispanics. Over 85% of hemodialysis patients travel three times a week to dialysis facilities to receive life-sustaining treatments and cannot shelter in place. There is a critical need to characterize COVID-19 transmission pathways in dialysis patients and clinics, identify potential coronavirus carriers, and develop procedures to curb the spread. With regular medical encounters, a large amount of data has been collected for each patient over time. These data have not been fully utilized for COVID-19 prediction and control in dialysis clinics. In this proposal, we seek to leverage demographic, clinical, treatment, laboratory, socioeconomic, serological, metabolomic, wearable and machine-integrated sensors, and COVID-19 surveillance data to develop mathematical and statistical models and implement them in a large number of dialysis clinics. The mathematical and statistical modeling using multiple data resources will help us understand how COVID-19 spread in dialysis facilities, identify potential COVID-19 patients before symptoms appear, and identify potential asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. We will develop novel mathematical and statistical models that fully utilize the high dimensional multimodal data available to us and other dialysis providers. We capitalize on the intrinsic advantages of hemodialysis clinics to implement and validate the proposed prediction models. We firmly believe that this cross-disciplinary effort will improve patients’ and staff’s safety while delivering high-quality, individualized care to a high-risk population.

"Accelerating collaborative, cumulative, and open intervention science with an e-intervention authoring platform Background. Research has identified a wide range of evidence-based interventions for key behavioral health risks such as poor diet, smoking, unhealthy alcohol use, or a sedentary lifestyle. However, to be truly successful, behavioral intervention science should fulfill at least three key criteria: (1) demonstration of cumulative increases in intervention efficacy; (2) provision of interventions that reach a high proportion of those in need; and (3) demonstration of a meaningful population impact/reduction in disease burden. It currently meets none of these. Some reasons for this include (1) over-reliance on an imprecise delivery mechanism (people; usually therapists or coaches of some kind) that is difficult to train to fidelity on a large scale, and that cannot be manipulated with precision; (2) use of sample sizes that may be far below what is needed to accurately characterize heterogeneity of response; and (3) cross-study variability in therapist characteristics, sample characteristics, and measurement strategy. All of this combines to create a science that lacks evidence of cumulative improvements upon prior benchmarks. Proposed solution. Mobile technology shows significant promise as an intervention delivery mechanism that is replicable, transparent, modular, and precise. However, progress in the development and implementation of mobile interventions has been slowed by factors such as the tremendous time and money needed to develop an intervention; limitations in cross-platform compatibility and interoperability; and lack of a consistent system around which to collaborate. To address these needs, the PI developed the Computerized Intervention Authoring System (CIAS), which facilitates behavioral intervention science by allowing investigators to directly develop sophisticated and interactive mobile applications without programming. CIAS is already being used by investigators outside of the PI’s own lab, a process that has revealed significant interest in this software from a wide range of NIH-funded investigators, as well as significant limitations. Current aims. The proposed application will address these limitations, making CIAS into a significant, open-source, and virtually unique non-commercial research resource. In Aim 1, we will engage in sustained user experience testing designed to make the tool far more intuitive to use. This process is expected to result in a dramatic reorganization of the investigator interface, as well as in a complete set of evidence-based user training and support materials. In Aim 2, we will add a range of features and capabilities to make CIAS more powerful, flexible, and interoperable (e.g., by building to SMART Health IT standards, as well as FHIR open specifications to facilitate integration with Electronic Health Records). In Aim 3, we will engage in focused efforts to promote the use of CIAS as part of multi-lab collaborations using open science practices (e.g., via integration with the Open Science Framework). Importantly, we will engage in all of the above with the assistance of a highly accomplished panel of advisors who will help ensure that the final product is broadly relevant, future-facing, and usable to a broad range of behavioral scientists. Project Narrative Technology-delivered interventions are showing great potential to help people modify unhealthy behaviors like substance use, poor diet, and poor medication adherence. However, designing these interventions is time- consuming and expensive, which is slowing down research in this area as well as the rate at which such technology can help people. This project will develop a new version of existing software so it can allow scientists to easily and quickly collaborate to develop powerful interventions for mobile devices.","Accelerating collaborative, cumulative, and open intervention science with an e-intervention authoring platform",10271571,U24EB028990,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Budgets ', ' Computers ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Elements ', ' Future ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Interview ', ' Investments ', ' Language ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Smoking ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Support ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Intuition ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scientist ', ' System ', ' Healthy diet ', ' balanced diet ', ' good diet ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' Social Support System ', ' Support System ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' brief therapy ', ' brief treatment ', ' brief intervention ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' response ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' Malus domestica ', ' Apple ', ' Health Informatics ', ' consumer informatics ', ' Public Health Informatics ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Behavioral ', ' medication compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' Operating System ', ' National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering ', ' NIBIB ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' cost ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' virtual ', ' computerized ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' diet and exercise ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' alcohol misuse ', ' ethanol misuse ', ' unhealthy alcohol use ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' interoperability ', ' open source ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' user centered design ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' evidence base ', ' intervention effect ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' reduced substance use ', ' reduction in substance use ', ' substance use reduction ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile device application ', ' sedentary lifestyle ', ' Sedentary behavior ', ' Sedentary life-style ', ' healthy weight ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile technology ', ' open data ', ' open science ', ' open-source data ', ' Text Messaging ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' Unhealthy Diet ', ' poor diet ', ' SMART health ', ' Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources ', ' FHIR ', ' comparison intervention ', ' compare intervention ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' ']",NIBIB,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,U24,2021,377490,MI-08
"Acute Modulation of Stereotyped High Frequency Oscillations with a Closed-Loop Brain Interchange System in Drug Resistant Epilepsy Project Summary: High frequency oscillations (HFOs) of intracranial EEG (iEEG) have the potential to identify the surgical resection area/seizure onset zone (SOZ) in patients with drug resistant epilepsy. However, multiple reports indicate that HFOs can be generated not only by epileptic cerebral tissue but also by non-epileptic sites often including eloquent regions such as motor, visual and language cortices. In this project, we present the initial evidence of a recurrent waveform pattern that may be sufficient to distinguish pathological HFOs from physiological ones. Specifically, we show that the SOZ repeatedly generates sets of stereotypical HFOs with similar waveform morphology whereas the events recorded from out of SOZ were irregular. This morphological pattern served as a robust neurobiomarker to isolate SOZ from other brain areas in multiple patients consistently. While these promising preliminary results are in place, the functional utility of stereotyped HFOs in a closed-loop seizure control system remains unknown. As of today, not much is known whether the stereotyped HFOs generated by the SOZ can be detected with an implantable system. If this can be achieved, then HFOs can be strategically translated as a neurobiomarker into closed-loop seizure control applications. We hypothesize that pathologic stereotyped HFOs can be captured with the implantable Brain Interchange (BIC) system of CorTec and spatial topography of these events can be utilized by the implantable system to deliver targeted electrical stimulation to achieve seizure control. Using an acute setup within the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU), this project will investigate the feasibility of capturing stereotyped HFO events using the new BIC system and compare the detection results to those obtained with the commercially available amplifier. If the first phase (Aim-1) of our study becomes successful, later in the second phase (Aim-2), once again in the EMU, we will deliver targeted electrical stimulation to those brain sites associated with stereotyped HFOs using the BIC. We will investigate the modulatory effects of this closed-loop stimulation strategy by monitoring the changes in signature events such as spikes, epileptic discharges, ripples and fast ripples. If successful, this closed-loop system does not have to wait for a seizure to start in order to deliver the stimulation at its onset as done by the RNS system of Neuropace. In contrast, the system will monitor the spatial topography and rate of stereotyped HFOs and deliver targeted stimulation to these areas to prevent seizures from occurring. If the outcomes of our research in acute setting become successful, we will execute a clinical trial and run our methods with the implanted BIC system in a chronic ambulatory setting. 1 Project Narrative Overall, this proposal will investigate the functional utility of stereotyped HFOs by capturing them with a new implantable system (Brain Interchange - BIC of CorTec), which can sample neural data at higher rates >=1kHz and deliver targeted electrical stimulation to achieve seizure control. In contrast to current closed-loop systems (RNS), which wait for the seizure to start before delivering stimulation, the BIC system will monitor the spatial topography and rate of stereotyped HFOs and deliver targeted stimulation to these HFO generating areas to prevent seizures from occurring. If the outcomes of our research in acute setting become successful, we will execute a clinical trial and run our methods with the implantable BIC system in a chronic ambulatory setting. 1",Acute Modulation of Stereotyped High Frequency Oscillations with a Closed-Loop Brain Interchange System in Drug Resistant Epilepsy,10290984,UH3NS117944,"['Amplifiers ', ' Austria ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Electric Stimulation ', ' Electrical Stimulation ', ' electrostimulation ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' High Frequency Oscillation ', ' implantable device ', ' biomedical implant ', ' implant device ', ' indwelling device ', ' Laboratories ', ' Language ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Seizures ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Visual ', ' Cerebrum ', ' cerebral ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Neurologic Deficit ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' success ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' axon signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neurotransmission ', ' Reporting ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Refractory epilepsy ', ' drug-resistant epilepsy ', ' Intractable Epilepsy ', ' Brain region ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Motor ', ' Resolution ', ' Scheme ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' time use ', ' Outcome ', ' open source ', ' neurotechnology ', ' clinical practice ', ' neural implant ', ' brain implant ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,UH3,2021,980214,TX-18
"Developing cell-penetrating miniproteins as a new class of therapeutics Project Summary Current protein therapeutics have a major limitation: they generally cannot cross the cellular membrane or interact with cytosolic targets. The ability to design protein therapeutics that enter the cell cytosol would enable new therapeutic strategies across many disease areas, including cancer, autoimmunity, and neurological disease. Therapeutic “miniproteins” (30-60 residues in length) have the potential to address this challenge, and several miniproteins capable of efficiently reaching the cell cytosol have recently been identified. However, we lack a general understanding of the “design rules” for cell-penetrating miniproteins, limiting the development of this class of molecules. Furthermore, current approaches to measure cytosolic delivery require measuring each protein individually, which is slow and labor intensive. This makes it impossible to test large numbers of miniproteins to develop a robust, quantitative understanding of the determinants of cytosolic delivery. In this exploratory project, we will develop a new approach to measure delivery for each different protein in a large mixed pool, using targeted mass spectrometry to individually identify each miniprotein sequence. In our approach, a soluble mixed pool containing thousands of designed miniprotein sequences is incubated with cells, and miniproteins that enter those cells are captured by a cytosolic target. Miniproteins captured by the target are then purified out of the cellular contents and identified and quantified using targeted proteomics. The amount of each protein in the captured sample (relative to the starting sample) will provide a quantitative measure of delivery efficiency. This approach is unprecedented, and we will test and optimize this approach using different positive and negative control miniproteins, different library sizes, and different cell lines. With this method in hand, we will use approaches we previously pioneered to computationally design thousands of candidate cell-penetrating miniproteins with intentionally diverse sequence and structural properties. We will then quantify cytosolic delivery for these new proteins using our new high-throughput approach, creating unprecedented large-scale data on delivery efficiency. We will then use these data to build machine learning models that predict miniprotein delivery based on sequence and structural properties. Finally, we will repeatedly iterate, designing new miniprotein libraries based on our predictive models of delivery, testing these designs using our high-throughput experimental approach, and further updating our models. This iterative design-test- learn approach will build a robust, predictive understanding of the determinants of delivery. Ultimately, the ability to design cell-penetrating miniproteins will unlock a wide range of new therapeutic targets inside the cell. Project Narrative Protein drugs have revolutionized numerous areas of medicine, but a major part of biology – the inside of human cells – is currently inaccessible by protein drugs. Here, we develop a powerful new experimental approach to discover the rules for delivering protein drugs into cells. Discovering these rules will enable the development of new protein drugs with entirely new mechanisms of action.",Developing cell-penetrating miniproteins as a new class of therapeutics,10289040,R21GM143560,"['Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Charge ', ' Cytosol ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Engineering ', ' Escherichia coli ', ' E coli ', ' E. coli ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Lysosomes ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Peptides ', ' Plasma Cells ', ' Blood Plasma Cell ', ' Plasmacytes ', ' plasmocyte ', ' Protein Engineering ', ' genetic protein engineering ', ' protein design ', ' Proteins ', ' Endosomes ', ' Receptosomes ', ' Risk ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Structure-Activity Relationship ', ' chemical structure function ', ' structure function relationship ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Protein Binding ', ' bound protein ', ' Measurement ', ' Therapeutic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' success ', ' Hydrophobicity ', ' Structure ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' drug development ', ' Proteomics ', ' native protein drug ', ' pharmaceutical protein ', ' protein drug agent ', ' therapeutic protein ', ' Lysis ', ' Cytolysis ', ' small molecule ', ' Incubated ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Dose ', ' Affinity ', ' Data ', ' Recombinants ', ' Cellular Membrane ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' iterative design ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' new drug target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new therapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic strategies ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' course development ', ' class development ', ' course material development ', ' peptide drug ', ' therapeutic peptide ', ' nanomolar ', ' nano-molar ', ' novel drug class ', ' new drug class ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' multiplex assay ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Autoimmunity ', ' Autoimmune Status ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biology ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cell membrane ', ' Cytoplasmic Membrane ', ' Plasma Membrane ', ' plasmalemma ', ' ']",NIGMS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R21,2021,231323,IL-07
"DATA-DRIVEN MODELS TO PREDICT DELAYED CEREBRAL ISCHEMIA AFTER SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE Intracranial Aneurysm (IA) are characterized by a localized dilation and thinning of the blood vessel, and although they only affect 6% of the population, bleeding from them accounts for about 25% of cerebrovascular deaths. Rupture of intracranial aneurysms (IAs) causes one of the most lethal types of hemorrhagic stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage-SAH. Despite improvements in SAH management, mortality and morbidity rates remain high, largely due to delayed ischemic complications. Although symptomatic in up to 40%, because of its severe consequences and because we cannot identify who will develop spasm, all patients are subject to extensive monitoring protocols, entailing enormous resources and additional risk for monitoring and treatment.  This proposal seeks to develop predictive analytics, integrating quantitative angiography, non-invasive imaging, and clinical data, to improve outcomes for patients suffering subarachnoid hemorrhage by providing real time patient-specific guidance. Our central hypothesis is that angiographic parametric imaging (API) hemodynamic biomarkers correlate with vasospasm and impaired cerebral autoregulation, both of which are associated with poor outcomes in delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). API provides a set of maps of image-biomarkers that may be combined with patient-specific clinical information to robustly predict poor outcomes due to DCI. The proposal’s objective is to develop, standardize, and validate a diagnostic pipeline that uses image-based biomarkers and patient characteristics to predict patient-specific risk of developing DCI, as well as functional and cognitive outcomes.  Our application is significant since there is currently no reliable way to predict DCI early in a patient’s course, and reliable predictions could help to guide therapy and resource allocation. To achieve this, we propose two aims. In the first aim, we will expand on prior work using a machine learning framework to predict which patients are at lowest risk of developing DCI. In aim two we will develop tools to extend predictions to functional and cognitive outcomes. If successful, this will be one of the first machine learning applications to produce an integrated prediction tool that allows clinicians to modify treatment plans in real time to reduce patient risk and resource utilization. This proposal seeks to develop predictive analytics using quantitative angiography to identify vasospasm and impaired cerebral autoregulation, both of which can be used to predict at a patient- specific level who is at highest and lowest risk of poor outcomes due to delayed cerebral ischemia.",DATA-DRIVEN MODELS TO PREDICT DELAYED CEREBRAL ISCHEMIA AFTER SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE,10288178,R21NS123478,"['Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' non-invasive imaging ', ' noninvasive imaging ', ' Patient risk ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' neurovascular ', ' neuro-vascular ', ' improved outcome ', ' parametric imaging ', ' Affect ', ' Angiography ', ' Angiogram ', ' angiographic imaging ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Intracranial Aneurysm ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' indexing ', ' Infarction ', ' infarct ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Spasm ', ' Hyperkinesia ', ' Hyperkinesis ', ' Hyperkinetic Movements ', ' Muscle Spasm ', ' Muscular Spasm ', ' Specificity ', ' Standardization ', ' Subarachnoid Hemorrhage ', ' Testing ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Vasospasm ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Blinded ', ' Caring ', ' Ruptured Aneurysm ', ' Prophylactic treatment ', ' Prophylaxis ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Blood flow ', ' Cerebrum ', ' cerebral ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Event ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' hemorrhagic stroke ', ' Brain hemorrhage ', ' experience ', ' treatment planning ', ' Structure ', ' Modeling ', ' Cerebral Ischemia ', ' Cerebral Aneurysm ', ' Brain region ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cerebrovascular ', ' cerebral vascular ', ' cerebro-vascular ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Rupture ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Impairment ', ' ']",NINDS,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R21,2021,251625,NY-26
"Using community health centers to mitigate the impact of snakebite envenoming in low resource areas Abstract Globally, more than 90% of all snakebite envenomation (SBE) occur in low resource settings. This neglected tropical disease, affects 2.7 million people, with 81,000-138,000 deaths, and approximately 400,000 permanent disabilities annually. Antivenom is a safe, efficacious, time- dependent, and evidence-based treatment, but the availability and timely access to this standard of care is inadequate. It is critical to engage local communities to improve timely access in remote, low resource areas where most SBE morbidity occurs. This proposal will develop and evaluate an innovative multi-modal intervention to improve SBE care, including decentralized antivenom distribution among the existing community healthcare center (CHC) network in the Brazilian Amazon. This novel intervention will integrate (a) advanced geospatial artificial intelligence to create decentralized antivenom distribution models using existing CHCs that optimizes population coverage and time to reach care, (b) a cost-effectiveness evaluation model developed with key stakeholders, and (c) a culturally relevant SBE care package containing education, treatment guidelines, training on antivenom delivery and interfacility care coordination. Using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, we will conduct a formative evaluation of this multi-modal intervention and prepare an implementation strategy for the Brazilian Amazon, as well as prepare to scale up to other low resource locations. Consequently, we will have a standardized approach to use advanced analytics to optimize healthcare delivery in low resource settings that can be used in other countries and with other healthcare interventions.

One area in which pathology is especially critical for diagnosis and clinical decision making is thyroid related disease and cancers. The incidences of thyroid nodules and cancers have increased worldwide. A fundamental part of the clinical assessment for thyroid nodules is ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB). Unfortunately, this cytopathology expertise is scarce in LMIC and many nodules are surgically removed for diagnosis. Since 90-95% of these nodules are without malignancy, many patients undergo unnecessary surgery with the associated risks, financial costs, and stressing already limited resources. What is critically needed is a means to provide cytopathology expertise to interpret thyroid FNAB in LMIC. The overall goal of this proposal is to implement our ML approach into low resource settings to provide accurate and timely cytopathology analysis of FNAB specimens. This R21/33 proposal focuses on MLA adaptation using smartphones for LMIC (R21) and subsequent capacity building and implementation (R33) through well-established LMIC research partnerships in tertiary centers in Tanzania and Vietnam. We hypothesize that our MLA can use smartphone captured images to assess probability of malignancy in thyroid FNAB that is comparable to trained cytopathologists. Our Aims are: R21: Adaptation of a smartphone approach to capture cytopathology images for MLA analysis. Archived FNAB samples used at different international institutions will be used to train and adapt the MLA with these images. Furthermore, we would train local personnel in LMIC to image capture using this new setup. The results from this phase will be an adapted MLA using smartphone images that has comparable sensitivity and specificity to the original MLA. R33: Implementation of the smartphone MLA approach into LMIC clinical settings. A prospective implementation of this approach in tertiary centers in Tanzania and Vietnam will be conducted. FNAB samples obtained would undergo standard of care pathology assessment as well as be analyzed with the MLA protocol. Local cytopathologist assessment will be compared with the MLA analysis. Outcome measures include MLA assessment of slides, technical slide review and image capture, concordance with pathology between MLA and expertise both in US and LMIC. The expected outcome will lead to a cost-effective method to implement MLA for thyroid FNAB that can be used in LMIC. This approach will not only assist in early diagnosis of thyroid cancers but also improve the utilization of limited resources through effectively identifying those that need surgery from those that do not. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Cytopathology plays a critical role in the assessment of fine needle aspiration biopsies (FNAB) of thyroid nodules that may harbor cancers. This expertise is a scarce resource in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMIC). This project will tailor an existing machine learning algorithm for use in LMIC, specifically Tanzania and Vietnam, in order to have a future protocol in which expert cytopathology can be immediately accessible using existing equipment and mobile devices. This will be done through implementation of a protocol to analyze FNAB using a machine learning algorithm.",Adapting a machine learning algorithm to predict thyroid cytopathologyin LMIC,10269391,R21CA268428,"['Archives ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of thyroid ', ' Malignant Thyroid Gland Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Thyroid ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Thyroid Gland ', ' Thyroid Cancer ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Financial cost ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Equipment ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Iodine ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Nodule ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Stains ', ' Staining method ', ' Stress ', ' Tanzania ', ' Testing ', ' Thyroid Gland ', ' Thyroid ', ' Thyroid Head and Neck ', ' Thyroid Nodule ', ' Thyroid Gland Nodule ', ' Time ', ' Triage ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' Vietnam ', ' Viet Nam ', ' Asians ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' base ', ' Microscope ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Funding ', ' Cytopathology ', ' Cytology and Pathology ', ' Pathologist ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Unnecessary Surgery ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Slide ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Biopsy Sample ', ' Biopsy Specimen ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Institution ', ' FNA ', ' Fine Needle Aspirate ', ' Fine-Needle Aspiration ', ' Fine needle aspiration biopsy ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' International ', ' Resolution ', ' Preparation ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' standard of care ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' LMIC ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' ']",NCI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,201997,NC-04
"mHealth Tympanometer: A Digital Innovation to Address Preventable Childhood Hearing Loss in Low- and Middle-Income Countries ABSTRACT Hearing loss is the second leading impairment worldwide. Childhood hearing loss has lifelong implications and disproportionately affects individuals in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Up to 75% of childhood hearing loss in LMICs is preventable due to the high prevalence of infection-related hearing loss. School hearing screening is critical for identification of childhood hearing loss in low resource settings, where newborn screening is unavailable. However, most screening programs only use pure-tone screening that does not identify middle ear disease widespread in populations with a high prevalence of infection-related hearing loss. This is because tympanometry, used to clinically identify middle ear disease, is expensive and designed for trained professionals. Our goal is to develop and validate an mHealth tympanometer with machine learning diagnostic support to transform this technology into a low-cost tool that could be broadly disseminated in LMICs, where the burden of hearing loss is greatest and is not addressed by current hearing screening methodology. Our study team is comprised of international leaders in hearing loss, audiology, data science, engineering, user- centered design, and device development in LMICs. We have also partnered with hearX, a University of Pretoria spinout company that developed the only validated mHealth pure-tone screening device. To test this new device in an appropriate LMIC setting, we have partnered with the South African site from the Global HEAR Collaborative, our consortium of collaborators from 28 countries that is the only international research network dedicated to hearing loss. We documented the need for this device in a large cluster randomized trial recently completed in rural Alaska, where tympanometry significantly improved the accuracy of school hearing screening in a population with a high prevalence of infection-related hearing loss. Using data from this trial and pilot funding, we are developing a machine learning tympanometry algorithm for lay screeners, and early hardware prototype fabrication is underway. In Aim 1, we will refine the hardware prototype using a user-centered design approach, cyclically incorporating feedback from South African team members during testing in a lab environment. In Aim 2, we will develop software through user-centered design that integrates the machine learning algorithm and refined hardware prototype. The resulting mHealth tympanometer will advance to the R33 phase. Technology development will be completed in Aims 3 and 4 through integration of the mHealth tympanometer with existing health information technology and an early feasibility study in 15 preschool children in South Africa to optimize device design for lay users. In Aim 5, we will validate the mHealth tympanometer with lay screeners through a clinical performance study in 500 preschool children in South Africa. This technology, developed through partnership and testing in an LMIC setting, will empower teachers and community health workers to identify children at risk for preventable hearing loss. The Global HEAR Collaborative will provide infrastructure for future studies with the proposed device across LMICs, directly addressing disparities in childhood hearing loss globally.

"COINSTAC 2.0: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data Project Summary/Abstract  The brain imaging community is greatly benefiting from extensive data sharing efforts currently underway. However, there is still a major gap in that much data is still not openly shareable, which we propose to address. In addition, current approaches to data sharing often include significant logistical hurdles both for the investigator sharing the data (e.g. often times multiple data sharing agreements and approvals are required from US and international institutions) as well as for the individual requesting the data (e.g. substantial computational re- sources and time is needed to pool data from large studies with local study data). This needs to change, so that the scientific community can create a venue where data can be collected, managed, widely shared and analyzed while also opening up access to the (many) data sets which are not currently available (see overview on this from our group7). The large amount of existing data requires an approach that can analyze data in a distributed way while (if required) leaving control of the source data with the individual investigator or the data host; this motivates a dynamic, decentralized way of approaching large scale analyses. During the previous funding period, we developed a peer-to-peer system called the Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation (COINSTAC). Our system provides an independent, open, no-strings-attached tool that performs analysis on datasets distributed across different locations. Thus, the step of actually aggregating data is avoided, while the strength of large-scale analyses can be retained. During this new phase we respond to the need for advanced algorithms such as linear mixed effects models and deep learning, by proposing to develop decentralized models for these approaches and also implement a fully scalable cloud-based framework with enhanced security features. To achieve this, in Aim 1, we will incorporate the necessary functionality to scale up analyses via the ability to work with either local or commercial private cloud environments, together with advanced visualization, quality control, and privacy and security features. This suite of new functions will open the floodgates for the use of COINSTAC by the larger neuroscience community to enable new discovery and analysis of unprecedented amounts of brain imaging data located throughout the world. We will also improve usability, training materials, engage the community in contributing to the open source code base, and ultimately facilitate the use of COINSTAC's tools for additional science and discovery in a broad range of applications. In Aim 2 we will extend the framework to handle powerful algorithms such as linear mixed effects models and deep learning, and to perform meta-learning for leveraging and updating fit models. And finally, in Aim 3, we will test this new functionality through a partnership with the worldwide ENIGMA addiction group, which is currently not able to perform advanced machine learning analyses on data that cannot be centrally located. We will evaluate the impact of 6 main classes of substances of abuse (e.g. methamphetamines, cocaine, cannabis, nicotine, opiates, alcohol and their combinations) using the new developed functionality. 3 Project Narrative  Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on collecting human neuroimaging data for clinical and re- search studies, many of which do not come with subject consent for sharing or contain sensitive data which are not easily shared, such as genetics. Open sharing of raw data, though desirable from the research perspective, and growing rapidly, is not a viable solution for a large number of datasets which have additional privacy risks or IRB concerns. The COINSTAC solution we propose enables us to capture this `missing data' and achieve the same performance as pooling of both open and `closed' repositories by developing privacy preserving versions of advanced and cutting edge algorithms (including linear mixed effects models and deep learning) and incorpo- rating within an easy-to-use and scalable platform which enables distributed computation. 2","COINSTAC 2.0: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data",10269008,R01DA040487,"['Adoption ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Algorithms ', ' Atlases ', ' Awareness ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cocaine ', ' Communities ', ' Consent Forms ', ' Consent Documents ', ' Informed Consent Documents ', ' Informed Consent Forms ', ' Data Aggregation ', ' Aggregated Data ', ' Decentralization ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Methamphetamine ', ' Crystal Meth ', ' Deoxyephedrine ', ' Desoxyephedrine ', ' Methylamphetamine ', ' N-Methylamphetamine ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Nicotine ', ' Privatization ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality Control ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Privacy ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Opioid ', ' Opiates ', ' Logistics ', ' Funding ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Informatics ', ' Statistical Bias ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' Agreement ', ' substances of abuse ', ' Substance of Abuse ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Genomics ', ' Cannabis ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' structural genomics ', ' Institution ', ' Legal ', ' Address ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Security ', ' Update ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Source Code ', ' virtual ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' distributed data ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' open source ', ' usability ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' data sharing ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' IRB ', ' IRBs ', ' cloud based ', ' data visualization ', ' open data ', ' open science ', ' open-source data ', ' life-long learning ', ' lifelong learning ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' deep learning ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' computational platform ', ' computing platform ', ' learning algorithm ', ' Visualization ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' privacy preservation ', ' Data Pooling ', ' data harmonization ', ' harmonized data ', ' data reuse ', ' data re-use ', ' data repository ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' ']",NIDA,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,617911,GA-05
"A Cognitive Risk Calculator and Screening tool for Primary Care Settings PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The number of people with Alzheimer’s disease is expected to exceed 88 million by 2050. Early detection of Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders symptoms are imperative for efforts to develop disease modifying therapies or interventions, and are important for optimal patient care. The objective of this proposal is to provide an accurate, feasible, and low-cost process to facilitate cognitive screening in population health. The aims of the R61 project are to develop and validate two complementary, automated tools to identify and screen patients at high risk for cognitive decline. The first is a risk calculator that uses routine clinical data to estimate patients’ risk for cognitive decline. Patients 60 years and older will undergo formal cognitive testing, and five prior years of routinely-collected electronic health record data will be used to model cognitive status. The Cognitive Risk Calculator will be validated in two historical samples and integrated into the electronic medical record to help providers identify vulnerable patients. The second tool is a validated iPad-based screening tool, the Brief Assessment of Cognitive Health (BACH) that patients can complete independently before, during, or after their doctor appointment. Patients will complete the BACH, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test (a paper-and-pencil screening tool), and formal neuropsychological testing at two time points. We hypothesize the BACH will be more sensitive to cognitive change over time than the established screening tool. The BACH is already integrated into the Epic electronic medical record platform; cognitive score and screening results for depression, stress, and sleep disruption are automatically recorded in the patient’s medical record for providers to document and act upon. The R33 project is a Phase IV pragmatic clinical trial to gauge the uptake and utility of these tools in primary care practices. Six internal medicine clinics will be randomized over time to the active study arm (Risk Calculator and BACH). This will permit comparisons of standard of care screening practices with screening activities following introduction of the Cognitive Risk Calculator and BACH. We will use a mixed-methods approach to determine optimal implementation strategies across a variety of practice models. Impact: The EHR risk-calculator and BACH have the capacity to improve detection of cognitive decline on a population health scale. The project also examines how regional differences in socioeconomic advantage relate to health disparities measured in terms of cognitive risk as well as screening attitudes and behaviors on the part of both providers and patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE Population health protocols lack efficient and effective methods to screen cognitive health.

"The Long-Run Impacts of Natural Disasters on Mortality and Disease Burden Among US Elderly and Disabled Adults OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Summary/Abstract The Long-run Impacts of Natural Disasters on Mortality and Disease Burden among US Elderly and Disabled Adults Natural disasters have increased in frequency and severity in recent decades, a trend projected to intensify under climate change. The risks these disasters pose to individual health and well-being are heightened among older adults with age-related disabilities or chronic illness, such as those living with Alzheimer’s disease or dementia. Public policies regarding disaster preparedness and response serve an important role in avoiding or reducing the health impacts of disasters and improving individual health resiliency. The optimal design of these policies depends crucially on quantifying the short- and long-run health risks imposed by disasters, precisely identifying the most vulnerable populations, and understanding the underlying mechanisms that drive and mediate outcomes. However, much remains unknown about these important dimensions. This project will use individual-level administrative Medicare data on all elderly (65+) and long-term disabled beneficiaries from 1992– 2017 to estimate the short- and long-run effects of a broad range of natural disasters – such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods – on health, health care use, and health-related expenditures among the elderly. The study will compile a comprehensive and spatially detailed database of US natural disasters from a variety of data sources. The Medicare data provide the 9-digit ZIP code of residence, allowing researchers to pinpoint the location of victims more precisely than prior research. The project will track individuals living in disaster-affected areas before the disaster regardless of where they move, and a control group of unaffected elderly will be used to establish how outcomes would have evolved in the absence of the event. The project will also use a new machine learning approach to identify vulnerable subpopulations based on individual health characteristics (e.g., pre-existing chronic conditions), demographic traits (e.g., age, race, sex), and local economic and public health circumstances (e.g., per capita income, prevalence of obesity, community participation in the National Flood Insurance Program's Community Rating System). The project will also assess several continuity-of-care mechanisms that could moderate or exacerbate post-disaster mortality and disease impacts, including damage to health care facilities, loss of access to one’s physician, and health plan network restrictions. This analysis will be performed for the whole population of beneficiaries and for subpopulations thought to be particularly vulnerable to continuity-of-care disruptions, like adults with multiple pre-existing chronic conditions. Finally, the project will estimate the extent to which certain characteristics (e.g., health care availability, local government expenditure, and healthy behaviors) in areas where victims relocate to following a disaster can explain their health outcomes. OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Narrative This project will use individual-level administrative Medicare data to estimate the short- and long-run effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods on health, health care use, and health-related expenditures among the elderly and people with long-term disabilities.

"iPAT:Intelligent Diet Quality Pattern Analysis for Harmonized MA-National Trials PROJECT SUMMARY A decade ago, the U.S. Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee recommended dietary pattern approaches to examine relationships between diet and health outcomes. Meanwhile, longitudinal dietary data have become increasingly available. However, methods are underdeveloped for characterizing dynamic diet-quality variations and remain rudimentary for validating longitudinal diet-quality patterns, thus, leading to unclear evidence for assessing diet-health relationships and formulating dietary guidelines. A noticeable gap exists between the dietary pattern literature and the fast-growing statistical learning field with explosive growth of artificial intelligence algorithms. We propose to develop “iPAT:Intelligent Diet Quality Pattern Analysis for Harmonized MA-National Trials”. iPAT will leverage original and newly harmonized dietary data generated from 7 studies funded by NIDDK, NHLBI, and NIMH: 4 longitudinal randomized controlled trials (RCT) in Massachusetts (MA), and 3 large-scale longitudinal multi-site national studies, an RCT and one observational study (OS) from the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI), and one OS from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. We aim to harness over 20 newly-harmonized dietary datasets from these highly-comparable longitudinal studies that span up to 35 years and cross 50 clinical and health community centers to: 1) innovate by adapting our new visualization-aided trajectory pattern-recognition and validation algorithm to an intelligent and streamlined pattern analysis tool (iPAT) for longitudinal dietary data; 2) enable a new multi-view and comprehensive understanding of diet-quality trajectory patterns for multiple chronic disease outcomes that may not be discoverable from individual studies at different levels of granularity; and 3) create an accessible and expandable harmonized dietary database and open-access iPAT tool for diet-related studies. Our harmonized-data-driven approach will increase the likelihood of successfully addressing complex and subtle questions with large-scale dietary data, including but not limited to the cultural, age, gender and geographic variation in diet quality patterns and how diet quality may vary with context and time. Our iPAT approach will be built upon PI Fang’s behavioral trajectory pattern-recognition method which has been validated and replicated in five NIDA/NCI/NHLBI-funded longitudinal OS and RCTs. Developing this evidence- based iPAT tool will contribute to the infrastructure for diet-related studies, advance pattern-recognition methods, help scientific communities and the public to compare individual dietary behavior with local and national diet- quality patterns and associated dietary health risks. Our work will also help grow more valid evidence for dietary guidelines. More broadly, this iPAT project will contribute to creating a platform that supports harmonized data management, near-real-time pattern analyses and adaptive interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Understanding human food intake behavior and related health risks is critical for important societal goals such as preventing or managing many chronic conditions, promoting well-being and safety, and improving life-long health learning. Harnessing a number of harmonized dietary data from highly-comparable local and national trials, our innovative Intelligent Diet Quality Pattern Analysis (iPAT) tool will provide a more robust identification and visualization of diet-quality patterns and clarify our understanding of diet-disease relationships for a range of people over time and across geographic regions. Our work will help grow more valid evidence for formulating dietary guidelines and may enable better personalized, adaptive dietary strategies.",iPAT:Intelligent Diet Quality Pattern Analysis for Harmonized MA-National Trials,10276034,R01DK129432,"['Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' data management ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' Nutrient ', ' simulation ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' response ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' dietary pattern ', ' Dietary Practices ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' Cognitive ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' treatment effect ', ' user-friendly ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study ', ' Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults ', ' social media ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' Longitudinal observational study ', ' Longitudinal observation study ', ' dietary guidelines ', ' Infrastructure ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' adaptive intervention ', ' statistical learning ', ' Visualization ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' data harmonization ', ' harmonized data ', ' dietary ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Intelligence ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Methods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Psychological Factors ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' Neighborhood Health Center ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS DARTMOUTH,R01,2021,748446,MA-09
"A clinical prediction rule for identifying South African colorectal cancer patients who will fail to engage in oncology care PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Colorectal cancer (CRC) is an emerging public health problem in South Africa (SA). Preliminary research from KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), SA shows that 23% of newly diagnosed CRC patients in the public healthcare sector will fail to engage in oncology care (FEOC). This complicates oncologists’ and oncologic surgeons’ efforts to effectively manage CRC disease in this setting. There are a variety of resource-intensive interventions for addressing FEOC. However, implementing these in all newly diagnosed CRC patients would be unfeasible, given the high patient volumes and existing resource constraints in the SA public healthcare sector. A clinical prediction rule (CPR) is proposed for identifying newly diagnosed SA CRC patients who are at high risk of FEOC, thereby enabling more efficient targeting of these specific, high risk patients for interventions which seek to address FEOC. The CPR will be developed by: 1) Identifying potential predictors of FEOC in CRC populations through a systematic review of the literature and a survey of 109 patients; 2) Constructing an appropriate electronic data collection tool that will streamline prospective data collection for these potential predictors and the study outcome, FEOC, from a cohort of 398 newly diagnosed CRC patients; and 3) Applying machine learning methods to the data to derive and internally validate the CPR. The CPR will be an important first step in tackling the high FEOC rates amongst newly diagnosed CRC patients in KZN, SA and will ultimately contribute toward improving both CRC disease management and patient outcomes in this setting. The proposed K43 research has the potential to be scaled up to the national level, and this will be the basis of a future R01 grant application. Dr. Moodley (K43 applicant) wants to become an independent gastrointestinal cancer epidemiologist and a global leader in CPRs, particularly CPRs that seek to address breakdowns in linkage to care and reduce the burden of disease attributed to gastrointestinal cancers, such as CRC. This award will provide him with protected time to conduct the proposed research and engage in an intensive career development program while based at one of the top universities in SA, the University of KwaZulu-Natal. He will be mentored by esteemed senior researchers from SA (Prof. Thandinkosi Madiba, University of KwaZulu-Natal) and the US (Prof. Ravi Pokala Kiran, Columbia University) who have a strong track record of mentoring young researchers. A research advisory committee, comprised of other senior researchers, will provide additional research and career guidance to Dr. Moodley. This will be coupled with didactic and “hands on” training in the core competencies required to develop CPRs. It is envisioned that by the end of his K43 training, Dr. Moodley will have developed the proposed CPR and generated new preliminary data. He will use this new data to successfully apply for an R01 grant, thus establishing his independence as gastrointestinal cancer epidemiologist and a global leader in CPRs. PROJECT NARRATIVE An unacceptably high proportion of newly diagnosed colorectal cancer (CRC) patients in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa (SA) will fail to engage in oncology care (FEOC), thereby complicating oncologists’ and oncologic surgeons’ efforts to effectively manage CRC disease in this resource-limited setting. A novel clinical prediction rule (CPR) will be developed that will allow for specific CRC patients who are at higher risk of FEOC to be identified and efficiently targeted for resource-intensive strategies which seek to reduce FEOC rates.

"Optimizing Oral Cancer Screening and Precision Management of Potentially Malignant Oral Lesions Project Summary  Despite treatment advances over the past several decades, cancer-specific survival for oral cancers remains bleak, mostly due to the majority of cases being diagnosed at late stages. Early-stage detection of cancers (most often oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC)) would enable less disfiguring, less costly therapy with curative intent. However, limitations of traditional visual-tactile examination for oral cancerous and pre- cancerous lesions have hindered cancer detection and support for screening. Visual inspection for separation of benign from precancerous or cancerous lesions is inaccurate, and therefore standard practice entails referral and scalpel biopsy of most potentially malignant oral lesions. Furthermore, approximately 20% of potentially malignant oral lesions contain some degree of epithelial dysplasia or carcinoma, and therefore early identification could allow curative treatment as the majority of OSCC typically starts as dysplasia, and the degree of dysplasia is correlated with the rate of malignant transformation. Detractors of oral screening cite the high prevalence of benign oral lesions and mild dysplasia as circumstances placing patients at risk of harms from over-testing and over-treatment. Thus, screening efforts could be transformed by adjunctive diagnostic tests that offer highly accurate cytopathologic information at the point of care, such as the NIDCR-supported Point-of-Care Oral Cytopathology Tool. Computer vision-assisted precision imaging tests have recently shown strong diagnostic performance for oral lesion characterization, but their potential pitfalls and promises must be thoroughly investigated before clinical application. Similarly, machine learning could bolster optical tests for visualizing potentially malignant lesions. If successful, these artificial intelligence devices could aid decision- making, preventing unnecessary scalpel biopsies for low-risk lesions and enabling risk-stratified surveillance or treatment. Our team of experts in computer disease simulation modeling, machine learning, oral medicine, and economic evaluation will transform a disease simulation model to provide analysis at the point of care, and evaluate the different potential uses of precision imaging diagnostics for translation to clinical care. We will expand our existing disease model of potentially malignant oral lesions to represent lesion characteristics and clinical risk categories (e.g. based on tobacco and alcohol use) through incorporation of large longitudinal datasets (Aim 1), in order to evaluate whether artificial intelligence-assisted cytologic testing can improve the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of screening for low, moderate, or high risk categories (Aim 2). Finally, we will evaluate whether adjuncts for lesion visualization render favorable effectiveness and cost effectiveness of screening across risk categories, with or without artificial intelligence support, and develop a user interface for the model (Aim 3). This work will produce an analytic engine to guide clinical translation of artificial intelligence- aided diagnostics for oral lesion detection and characterization, to overcome insufficient screening reliability. Project Narrative Early stage oral cancers and precancers are currently under-detected, representing missed opportunity to improve the poor outcomes of oral cancer. While screening with conventional visual-tactile examination is limited in accuracy, artificial intelligence-assisted precision diagnostics could shift the cancer prevention paradigm toward screening for the broader population if enabling reliable triage of oral lesions for risk-based management. The proposed disease simulation model will evaluate the benefits and harms of harnessing these devices and precision treatment thresholds, guiding translation toward cancer control.",Optimizing Oral Cancer Screening and Precision Management of Potentially Malignant Oral Lesions,10298437,R01DE030169,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biopsy ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Carcinoma ', ' Epithelial cancer ', ' Malignant Epithelial Neoplasms ', ' Malignant Epithelial Tumors ', ' epithelial carcinoma ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Computers ', ' Consultations ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Cytology ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Oral Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic Imaging ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Oral Medicine ', ' Stomatology ', ' Oral Stage ', ' Patients ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Triage ', ' Work ', ' Decision Aid ', ' Decision Modeling ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Specialist ', ' oral lesion ', ' mouth lesion ', ' economic evaluation ', ' economic analysis ', ' Caring ', ' malignant mouth neoplasm ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Tumor ', ' Malignant Oral Neoplasm ', ' Mouth Cancer ', ' Oral Cancer ', ' malignant mouth tumor ', ' oral cavity cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of pharynx ', ' Malignant Pharyngeal Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Pharyngeal Tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Pharynx ', ' Pharnyx Cancer ', ' Pharyngeal Cancer ', ' Pharynx Cancer ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Malignant -

"Using Artificial Intelligence to Identify Accelerated Brain Aging in World Trade Center Responders PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The men and women who worked in rescue and recovery operations at the 9/11 World Trade Center (WTC) site are developing cognitive impairment at mid-life, decades before age-based cognitive impairment is usually detected. To date, one of the most consistent risk factors for cognitive dysfunction and impairment in this population include long-term exposures to the WTC disaster sites and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Our preliminary analyses identified reduced cortical thickness in responders with dementia compared to cognitively unimpaired WTC responders. While this work has been valuable in advancing our understanding of cognitive impairment in WTC responders, it remains unknown to what extent reduced cortical thickness is indicative of a known disorder, and no studies to date have been able to reliably quantify the extent to which patterns evident on MRI match population norms. Our team has recently identified a highly sensitive biomarker for functional “brain age,” which we have shown to detect the first signs of deterioration as early as the late 40’s. Known as brain “network stability,” this measure replicates across multiple large-scale resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets and correlates with gradual cognitive decline. The difference between an individual’s predicted age based on MRI data (“brain age”) versus their chronological age provides a metric for accelerated brain aging. Therefore, a critical next step is to characterize WTC responders’ brain ages, both structurally (cortical thickness) and functionally (network stability), which may relate WTC trauma to observed cognitive impairment at mid-life. In the present work, we propose to complete secondary data analyses of a large-scale brain MRI training data set (UK Biobank, N=19,831) to train a deep learning model for neurobiological signatures of aging and its potential mechanisms. We will then compare neurobiological features seen in WTC responders to these signatures. In Aim 1, we measure accelerated brain aging for WTC responders with and without PTSD, using comparing brain aging to population norms, as well as to proteomic markers of Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias, including β-amyloid and tau. In Aim 2, we leverage our previous methods development in AI of neuroimaging data to develop neurobiological classifiers specific to key mechanisms of relevance to WTC: particulates, glucocorticoids, inflammation, anxiety, depression, and PTSD, to determine whether AI classifies WTC brains as matching neurobiological signatures specific to one or more of these mechanisms. This study responds to a call for aging-related research proposals in WTC-affected individuals (RFA-OH-21-004) and will improve our understanding of accelerated neurobiological aging in an existing neuroimaging study of WTC responders. For the prevention of ADRD to be successful, reliable measures are needed for subclinical changes in accelerated brain aging that occur in midlife. This study seeks to implement a novel measure of brain age optimized to be sensitive to midlife neurological changes and combines it with AI to identify the mechanisms through which exposures may have affected WTC responders.

"Biomedical Data Translator Development of Autonomous Relay Agent: ARAX This project would continue collaborative work within the Translator consortium by a multi-site team (“Team X-ray”) at Oregon State University (PI Stephen Ramsey) and at two partner institutions, Pennsylvania State University (PI Koslicki) and the Institute for Systems Biology (PI Eric Deutsch; Co-I Jared Roach). Team X-ray was highly productive in Translator's feasibility assessment phase and the team brings critical expertise to Translator (see Resources). Component type: We propose to create, validate, and integrate an autonomous relay agent (ARA) called ARAX . ARAX will be a middleware component in the new Translator architecture that will extend significantly beyond the capabilities of the prototype reasoning tool (RTX) that we created in the feasibility assessment phase. Depending on the input request, ARAX's main output will be ranked subgraphs with clearly explained ranking basis. ARAX will leverage code and algorithms from RTX and will have an explicit application focus area, as described below. Main problems that ARAX is trying to address: Connections within a biomedical knowledge graph have highly variable degrees of (i) confidence (due to ambiguous predicates and/or due to highly variable degrees of reliability of knowledge types) and (ii) potential relevance to the user's query. Such edge-significance variability leads to both incorrect and difficult-to-interpret results which together pose a significant problem for creating broadly useful tools for computer-based biomedical reasoning. We propose to address this problem by explicitly accounting for these two types of edge variability in the reasoning algorithms–spanning a broad range of biomedical query types–that ARAX will provide to Translator. In addition to these broad capabilities, as described in the Project Plan, we will incorporate advanced algorithms in ARAX for responding to queries relating to disease therapy, including (1) drug repositioning for known disease, leveraging knowledge about the disease’s pathogenesis [1] ; and (2) therapeutic recommendations for rare diseases based on symptoms and the putative causal genetic variant. Plan for implementation of the project: In our Project Plan we describe a five-year timeline for creating, validating, and integrating ARAX within Translator, beginning with a three-month sprint leading to a prototype of ARAX by mid-March 2020. Key components of the plan include: (1) leveraging the BioThings Explorer software framework to enable ARAX to dynamically map between compounds, proteins, pathways, variants, phenotypes, and diseases based on knowledge source application programming interfaces in the Translator registry; (2) leveraging COHD and related Translator resources to obtain biomedical semantic distance information; (3) leveraging an application programming interface endpoint for the RTX biomedical knowledge graph, KG2; and (4) implementing probabilistic reasoning algorithms leveraging provenance information and dynamically determined edge relevance scores to improve reasoning. We will systematically use machine-learning to align ranking scores with measures of output quality. Collaboration strengths of our team include (i) developing technical standards for communications between Translator software agents (leveraging PI Deutsch’s extensive past experience); (ii) developing knowledge graph standards (leveraging PI Ramsey’s and PI Koslicki’s expertise); and (iii) deriving use-case vignettes that speak to the transformative potential of Translator (leveraging Co-I Roach’s and PI Ramsey’s expertise). In the development phase, our team would continue to collaborate with other teams and with NIH stakeholders in an adaptive, high-bandwidth, and team-boundary-agnostic fashion, as detailed in the Project Plan. Key challenges to building the proposed system are (1) the need to be able to ""chain"" together analytical steps between tools and (2) the need for cooperative development of standards that enable Translator components to interact; we address them in detail in the Project Plan.

"ARAGORN: Autonomous Relay Agent for Generation Of Ranked Networks We propose an Autonomous Relay Agent for Generation of Ranked Networks (ARAGORN), which will query Knowledge Providers (KPs) and synthesize answers relevant to user-specified questions, building upon algorithms and components developed as part of the ROBOKOP [1,2] application during the feasibility phase of Translator. The ARAGORN services represent the next generation of ROBOKOP component services, iterating and innovating in response to challenges exposed in the Translator feasibility phase. Based on that work, we have identified overarching issues that must be addressed to truly unleash the power of Translator. 1. ARAs must be able to operate in a federated knowledge environment effectively and efficiently. First-generation Translator tools assembled full data sets from which to extract answers, which were subsequently ranked. Second-generation tools must be able to efficiently operate on massive, distributed data, demanding a new approach. ARAGORN will act asynchronously, interleaving KP queries with partial scoring of answers, prioritizing search directions on-the-fly, and delivering early results that are updated over time in response to newly explored paths 2. ARAs must bridge the precision mismatch between data representations and algorithms that require specificity, and users who pose questions and prefer answers at a more abstract level. Biomedical scientists do not pose questions as database queries. Furthermore, even expert users of current biomedical databases such as ROBOKOP KG or RTX require exploration and experimentation to craft queries to express their intent. ARAGORN will employ multiple strategies to remove this barrier to asking questions effectively, from basic maintenance of a question library, to node generalization, query rewriting, and machine learning techniques such as capsule graph networks. ARAGORN will further use elements of specific answers to create gestalt explanations, clustering, and combining answers with similar content, revealing the commonalities and contradictions in answers. 3. ARAs must be able to generalize answer ranking to address a broader range of question formulations and data types, and to account for counterevidence. In the Translator implementation phase, we anticipate having access to many varied KPs and ARAs that provide diverse quantitative metadata regarding the confidence in assertions or strength of associations. There will be a pressing need to synthesize such data into scores for arbitrarily-shaped answer graphs, in order to filter and prioritize answers for further analysis or user digestion. ARAGORN will address this need by providing a novel scoring algorithm capable of (a) scoring arbitrary directed multi-hypergraphs, (b) accounting for heterogeneous quantitative metadata; and (c) leveraging relationship polarity to incorporate counterevidence. ARAGORN will provide access to this functionality, and connect to KPs using community-defined APIs and data models. The ARAGORN team has contributed to these community efforts during the Translator feasibility phase, and if funded will continue to work with the Standards and Reference Implementations (SRI) group, NCATS staff, and other awardees to continue to define and refine methods and models for data sharing and collaboration. The ARAGORN services will be created with collaboration in mind, such that they can be plugged into larger pipelining and architectural efforts. Most of the risks to the ARAGORN strategy are shared by the entire program; as standardization evolves, the ARAGORN team and other members of the Translator consortium will be required to spend effort updating components. ARAGORN will require access to ontology and similarity tools that we anticipate will be provided by KPs or shared infrastructure; if these do not materialize, the ARAGORN team will create the tools that it needs to accomplish its goals. Additionally, we are assuming the existence of fully translator-compliant KPs from which to draw data; if the program collectively decides that compliance is enforced in ARAs instead, we will draw on our work in ROBOKOP to implement the necessary normalization components in ARAGORN.

"Resilience, cultural alignment, and social support in brain aging: Data from the Strong Heart Study ABSTRACT When life stresses are especially intense, chronic, or overwhelming, deleterious health effects can occur, including inflammation, cardiovascular disease, disability, depression, low quality of life, and dementia. In this context, resilience can be defined as the ability to maintain a healthy aging trajectory despite adverse conditions of stress. American Indians (AI) have a unique history and ongoing experience of trauma and disparities in environmental and socioeconomic conditions, which amplify daily stresses and contribute to health risks. Despite these adverse circumstances, remarkable resilience has been described in AI populations. Recent work by our group suggests that social support and alignment with Native culture correlate with lower levels of stress, negativity, anger, hostility, depression, mortality, and cardiovascular disease. However, our findings on cultural alignment are limited, and none has yet explored associations of resilience and social support. It remains an open question whether neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) can result from chronic stress, or whether individual psychosocial characteristics such as resilience can mediate such risk. We propose to address these knowledge gaps by efficiently leveraging an existing effort funded by the NHLBI in the Strong Heart Study, a longitudinal cohort of AI adults from 13 tribal communities across the US. The existing contract covers recruitment, consenting, and basic clinical examination of 3,000 eligible participants in 2022-2024; we propose to augment the limited protocol by administering additional psychosocial and neuropsychological instruments on resilience, social support, cultural identity and alignment, and cognition. Our Specific Aims are to: describe associations of individual resilience among AI adults with identity and self-regard, social support, and cultural alignment, by age and sex; evaluate resilience, social support, and cultural features in relation to ADRD; and use machine learning to develop explanatory models of resilience and dementia. Our study has the potential to advance epidemiologic knowledge of modifiable psychosocial conditions in a vulnerable, underserved population, and consequently to offer a clearer picture of the relative contributions of psychosocial, behavioral, interpersonal, and socioeconomic factors related to ADRD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic stress can result in negative health effects, including inflammation, cardiovascular disease, and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD); American Indian (AI) populations have endured excess stresses and traumas, but have also shown remarkable psychosocial resilience, which may be related to robust social support, community environment, cultural identity. It is unclear which of these psychosocial features may be most predictive of psychosocial resilience in AI adults, or whether any is protective against neurodegeneration and ADRD. A search on NIH Reporter uncovered many projects focused on cognitive reserve—sometimes also called resilience—but none on psychosocial resilience or its related features as protective health characteristics in adult AIs. This project seeks to fill this knowledge gap with novel data collection and analysis on trait-based psychosocial resilience, related features, cognitive function, and ADRD in 3000 adult AIs as part of the ongoing Strong Heart Study.","Resilience, cultural alignment, and social support in brain aging: Data from the Strong Heart Study",10264169,R01AG070822,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Anger ', ' angers ', ' angry ', ' Anthropology ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cognition ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Health ', ' Heart ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hostility ', ' Inflammation ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Philosophy ', ' Poverty ', ' Impoverished ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' socio-economic factors ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Tribes ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Failure ', ' Spirituality ', ' Spiritualities ', ' Individual ', ' optimism ', ' postiive attitude ', ' Patient-Centered Care ', ' Funding ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' Reporter ', ' Navaho ', ' Navajo ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' bully ', ' bullying ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' intergenerational ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' cognitive reserve ', ' Underserved Population ', ' under served group ', ' under served people ', ' under served population ', ' underserved group ', ' underserved people ', ' tribal community ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Life Stress ', ' Trauma ', ' practical application ', ' application in practice ', ' eligible participant ', ' aging brain ', ' aged brain ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', ' healthy aging ', ' screening ', ' public health intervention ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' recruit ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' heterogenous data ', ' data heterogeneity ', ' data set heterogeneity ', ' dataset heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous data ', ' heterogeneous data sets ', ' heterogeneous datasets ', ' heterogenous data sets ', ' heterogenous datasets ', ' clinical examination ', ' clinical exam ', ' ']",NIA,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,590213,WA-05
"Computational Methods for Enhancing Privacy in Biomedical Data Sharing Project Summary Data sharing is essential to modern biomedical data science. Access to a large amount of genomic and clinical data can help us better understand human genetics and its impact on health and disease. However, the sensitive nature of biomedical information presents a key bottleneck in data sharing and collection efforts, limiting the utility of these data for science. The goal of this project is to leverage cutting-edge advances in cryptography and information theory to develop innovative computational frameworks for privacy-preserving sharing and analysis of biomedical data. We will draw upon our recent success in developing secure pipelines for collaborative biomedical analyses to address the imminent need to share sensitive data securely and at scale.  Practical adoption of existing privacy-preserving techniques in biomedicine has thus far been largely limited due to two major pitfalls, which this project overcomes with novel technical advances. First, emerging cryptographic data sharing frameworks, which promise to enable collaborative analysis pipelines that securely combine data across multiple institutions with theoretical privacy guarantees, are too costly to support complex and large-scale computations required in biomedical analyses. In this project, we will build upon recent advances in cryptography (e.g., secure distributed computation, pseudorandom correlation, zero-knowledge proofs) to significantly enhance the scalability and security of cryptographic biomedical data sharing pipelines. Second, existing approaches that locally transform data to protect sensitive information before sharing (e.g. de-identification techniques) either offer insufficient levels of protection or require excessive perturbation in order to ensure privacy. We will draw upon recent tools from information theory to develop effective local privacy protection methods that achieve superior utility-privacy tradeoffs on a range of biomedical data including genomes, transcriptomes, and medical images by directly exploiting the latent correlation structure of the data.  To promote the use of our privacy techniques, we will create production-grade software of our tools and publicly release them. We will also actively participate in international standard-setting organizations in genomics, e.g. GA4GH and ICDA, to incorporate our insights into community guidelines for biomedical privacy. Successful completion of these aims will result in computational methods and software tools that open the door to secure sharing and analysis of massive sets of sensitive genomic and clinical data. Our long-term goal is to broadly enable data sharing and collaboration efforts in biomedicine, thus empowering researchers to better understand the molecular basis of human health and to drive translation of new biological insights to the clinic. Project Narrative Rapidly-growing volume of biomedical datasets around the world promises to enable unprecedented insights into human health and disease. However, increasing concerns for individual privacy severely limited the extent of data sharing in the field. This project draws upon cutting-edge tools from cryptography and information theory to develop effective privacy- preserving methods for collecting, sharing, and analyzing sensitive biomedical data to empower advances in genomics and medicine.",Computational Methods for Enhancing Privacy in Biomedical Data Sharing,10260457,DP5OD029574,"['Adoption ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Foundations ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Information Theory ', ' Institutes ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Polynomial Models ', ' polynomials ', ' Modernization ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Privatization ', ' Production ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Translations ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' Privacy ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' infancy ', ' infantile ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' computer biology ', ' Computational Biology ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' empowered ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Genomics ', ' Enhancement Technology ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Preservation Technique ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Security ', ' Molecular ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' genome wide association study ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' cost ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' transcriptomics ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' cryptography ', ' task analysis ', ' data sharing ', ' Secure ', ' Complex Analysis ', ' privacy protection ', ' Data Science ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' Genomic medicine ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' analysis pipeline ', ' web server ', ' biomedical data science ', ' privacy preservation ', ' ']",OD,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",DP5,2021,392800,MA-07
"Optical Coherence Elastography of the Cornea PROJECT SUMMARY The fundamental physical properties of the outer tunic of the eye determine the structural characteristics of the ocular globe and may be altered in several devastating disease states including axial elongation in myopia, pathological deformation in keratoconus, and iatrogenic keratoectasia following corneal refractive surgery. These biomechanical tissue characteristics not only influence our clinical interpretation of diagnostic tests, e.g. measurement of intraocular pressure, but have been implicated as important factors in the development of glaucoma. Currently, there is no available reliable method to perform quantitative measurement of corneal elasticity in vivo. Here we will develop novel method for the assessment of corneal elastic properties that could potentially be used for routine clinical diagnostic and treatment. This method will take advantages of highly localized air pressure stimulation and ultra-sensitive detection and analysis of the pressure waves propagation on corneal posterior and anterior surfaces with a line-field Optical Coherence Tomography to reconstruct volumetric biomechanical properties of the cornea. Our previous work has made fundamental advances in the understanding of corneal biomechanics through a novel approach with potentially impactful applications in other disciplines (e.g. cataract surgery, LAISK, corneal cross-linking, and tissue transplants with personalize treatments). The proposed studies will accelerate transition of this technology into clinics, influence our selection and application of corneal surgical treatments and will help us to understand the structural consequences of corneal disease and wound healing: Aim 1. Develop a line-field OCE (LF-OCE) system for ultrafast 3D clinical imaging. Aim 2. In vivo studies with rabbits. Aim 3. Preliminary clinical studies in humans. Aim 4.

"Biases introduced by filtering electronic health records for patients with ""complete data"" PROJECT SUMMARY Nationwide adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has led to the increasing availability of large clinical datasets. With statistical modeling and machine learning, these datasets have been be used in a wide range of applications, including diagnosis, decision support, cost reduction, and personalized medicine. However, because the same patient could be treated at multiple health care institutions, data from only a single EHR might not contain the complete medical history for that patient, with critical events potentially missing. A common approach to addressing this problem is to apply data checks that filter the EHR for patients whose data appear to be more “complete”. Examples of filters include requiring at least one visit per year or ensuring that age, sex, and race are all recorded. However, in a previous study using EHR data from seven institutions, we showed that these filters can greatly reduce the sample size and introduce unexpected biases by selecting sicker patients who seek care more often and changing the demographics of the resulting cohorts. This project extends this prior research by implementing an expanded set of data completeness filters and testing their accuracy and potential biases using a combination of national claims data and EHR data from dozens of hospitals and healthcare centers across the country. This will enable us to understand how data completeness varies in different EHRs and quantify the tradeoffs of different approaches to correcting for gaps in patients' records. First, we will develop and measure the accuracy of data completeness filters using national claims data. This provides a “gold standard” of longitudinal data where patients' complete medical histories are known during the periods in which they were enrolled in the insurance plan. After partitioning the data by provider groups to model gaps in EHR data, we will test how well data completeness filters, individually and in combined machine learning models, select patients with fewer gaps. We will then test whether the filters introduce biases by selecting sicker patients (more diagnoses, more visits, etc.) or changing their demographic characteristics (age, sex, and zip code). Then, we will test the filters on EHR data, first at a single large medical center, and then across a national network of 57 institutions, representing different geographic regions, patient populations, number of years of data, and types of health care facilities. We will evaluate the filters by measuring whether they improve the performance of a machine learning model for predicting hospital admissions. Our ultimate goals are to (a) help researchers balance the need for complete data with the biases this might introduce to their models and (b) help them predict how well models trained on one EHR dataset might work on other EHRs with different data completeness profiles. PROJECT NARRATIVE Nationwide adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has led to the increasing availability of large clinical datasets.

This study identifies biases that are introduced by selecting patients with fewer gaps in their record.","Biases introduced by filtering electronic health records for patients with ""complete data""",10254420,R01LM013345,"['Adoption ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' care facilities ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' Israel ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Probability ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Testing ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Medical History ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Visit ', ' Medical center ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' care seeking ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Provider ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Ontology ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Clinical Trials Network ', ' Clinical and Translational Science Awards ', ' open source ', ' demographics ', ' patient population ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' insurance plan ', ' clinical database ', ' patient health information ', ' patient health record ', ' patient medical record ', ' ']",NLM,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2021,356912,MA-07
"Development and Validation of a Prediction Model to Address Physician Burnout PROJECT SUMMARY Professional burnout is a growing epidemic with symptoms affecting over 500,000 US physicians at any given time and carries significant adverse consequences for physician mental health, health care value, quality of care, and patient safety. There is an urgent need to develop reliable methods to proactively identify work environments at high risk for physician burnout, and tailor process improvements accordingly. The objective of this proposal is to develop and validate a real-time prediction model that uses operational data in primary care practices to identify high-risk clinics for physician burnout, enabling timely and tailored process improvements. The central hypothesis is that routinely-collected electronic health record (EHR) usage metrics coupled with practice-specific metrics can predict physicians’ risk for burnout and inform process improvement. The rationale for the proposed research is that early identification of high-risk clinics will allow organizations to tailor interventions to those clinics before burnout and its individual or health system consequences arise. This would be an innovative approach that prevents burnout rather than reacting to it. This project capitalizes on routinely-collect data from Stanford primary care clinics to create a database encompassing EHR usage metrics and practice-specific metrics. The specific aims are: Aim 1: Develop a prediction model to quantify risk for physician burnout. The working hypothesis is that real-time metrics of practice efficiency tracked by the EHR and other practice-specific metrics can predict physician burnout using a machine learning approach. Aim 2: Refine the prediction model using qualitative methods. The working hypothesis is that qualitative assessment will inform refinements to the prediction model created in Aim 1, and will demonstrate the face validity of the model. Aim 3: Validate the use of the prediction model to identify high-risk clinics. The working hypothesis is that quality of care metrics will demonstrate the concurrent validity, that subsequent routinely administered burnout surveys will demonstrate the predictive validity of the prediction model created in Aims 1 and 2, when aggregated at the clinic level. This proposal is significant because physician burnout is a growing problem with important implications for patient safety. It is also innovative in deploying machine learning and mixed methods to identify physicians at increased risk for burnout which will enable testing interventions to reverse this trend. In combination with formal training in quantitative and qualitative methods, expert mentorship, and participation in selected scholarly activities at Stanford, the experience gained through this project will facilitate progress toward a long-term goal to become an academic leader advancing evidence-based reform of the health care delivery system to optimize human factors that improve quality and safety. PROJECT NARRATIVE There is an urgent need to develop reliable methods to proactively identify and improve work environments with high risk for physician burnout, and doing so will have broad public health relevance by reducing risk for burnout and its negative effects on quality and safety of care. Addressing physician burnout in primary care carries relevance for AHRQ’s priority populations of women, children, the elderly, and low-income patients, who are particularly dependent on high quality primary care. This project will support AHRQ’s mission of producing evidence to make health care safer and higher quality by developing and validating a prediction model to identify high-risk primary care clinics for physician burnout in order to 1) inform resource allocation to clinics with the highest need, 2) tailor process improvements to reduce risk for burnout and poor quality of care, and 3) lay the groundwork for expanding this model to other high-risk practice settings and provider types.",Development and Validation of a Prediction Model to Address Physician Burnout,10252902,K08HS027837,[''],AHRQ,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K08,2021,152581,CA-18
"Personalized 3D avatar tool development for measurement of body perception across gender identities Abstract Public awareness of the diversity of experiences of gender identities has climbed sharply. The specific issues of those with gender dysphoria (GD) related to self-identity, body image, and medical interventions are challenges for the 21st century, particularly given the high risk of suicide. Gender identity is tightly linked to one’s bodily features, particularly readily observable sexual characteristics. For transgender and nonbinary individuals with GD, the incongruence between their body associated with their birth-assigned sex – what they see in the mirror before any treatment – and the internalized representation of their gender-identified body is a key defining part of their experience and contributes to their dysphoria. Currently, no clinical or research tool exists to capture and quantify the diverse experiences of one’s current body and one’s gender-identified body (which may be distinct from their current body), across a range of gender identities. Measuring the internalized representation of one’s body could be facilitated by technology to visually represent this on a three-dimensional avatar. The technology needed to scan and analyze the human figure is now available and cost efficient. It is now possible to scan individuals to create personalized 3D visualizations, or “avatars,” with which they can interact on mobile and desktop devices to represent internal representation of their bodies. This can allow individuals to see and manipulate their own 3D avatar with a high degree of flexibility. The goal of this project is to create a novel, visually based digital tool to measure, understand, and quantify individuals’ experiences of their bodies. We will develop, validate, and test in transgender, nonbinary, and cisgender adults a personalized avatar tool to represent internalized gender-identified bodies in order to quantify incongruence between this and one’s current body. This tool – “GD Somatomap” – will be an advancement over existing self-report questionnaires to capture visual representations of internalized body image, cross-sectionally and dynamically over time. It will be flexible enough to characterize the heterogenous experiences of a range of gender identities including binary transgender, gender fluid, nonbinary, and cisgender. It can be used in clinical and clinical research applications to track outcomes of cross-hormone and gender-affirming surgical treatments. It can potentially improve clinical outcomes by identifying specific sets of body parts as targets for treatments to improve body congruence. Further, it will provide a unique means to measure own-body perceptual accuracy; understanding differences in perceptual accuracy and what potentially modifiable factors contribute to this may have prognostic significance for treatments to address body incongruence. It could also be used in future studies to investigate functional and structural neurobiological correlates of body perception and internal body representation, and at what point in neurodevelopment these emerge for those with different gender identities. PROJECT NARRATIVE The internalized, conscious experience of one’s body is not easily communicated, much less measured and quantified. This is especially relevant for those with gender dysphoria, whose internal, gender-identified body representation is incongruent with their current body. We will develop and test an innovative technological solution, making use of 3D image reconstruction and advanced 3D modeling, to create personalized avatars to measure body incongruence for research and clinical applications in those with gender dysphoria.",Personalized 3D avatar tool development for measurement of body perception across gender identities,10480133,R21EB030851,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Awareness ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Body Image ', ' body perception ', ' Breast ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Discriminant Analysis ', ' Discriminant Analyses ', ' Future ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Goals ', ' Hormones ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' Least-Squares Analysis ', ' Least Squares ', ' Least-Squares Analyses ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Gonadal Steroid Hormones ', ' Sex Hormones ', ' Sex Steroid Hormones ', ' gonadal steroids ', ' sex steroid ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Body measure procedure ', ' Body Measures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Medical ', ' Waist-Hip Ratio ', ' waist-to-hip ratio ', ' Link ', ' Body part ', ' Distress ', ' dysphoria ', ' Conscious ', ' Consciousness ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Human body ', ' Human Figure ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Hormonal ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' trans* ', ' transgender ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' experience ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Morphologic Finding ', ' morphologic criteria ', ' morphologic signature ', ' morphological criteria ', ' morphological signature ', ' Physical shape ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' 3-D Images ', ' 3-D image ', ' 3D image ', ' 3D images ', ' Three-Dimensional Image ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Grouping ', ' groupings ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' body dissatisfaction ', ' three-dimensional modeling ', ' 3-D modeling ', ' 3D modeling ', ' digital ', ' Outcome ', ' cost efficient ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' tool development ', ' high risk ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' gender dysphoria ', ' gender dysphoric ', ' cisgender ', ' cis-gender ', ' prognostic significance ', ' gender fluid ', ' gender fluidity ', ' genderfluid ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' three-dimensional visualization ', ' 3-D visualization ', ' 3-dimensional visualization ', ' 3D visualization ', ' ']",NIBIB,CENTRE FOR ADDICTION AND MENTAL HEALTH,R21,2021,167495,
"Real time colon histopathology by infrared spectroscopic imaging Abstract Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of death in the US. Active screening and early intervention in risky cancers can lead to good outcomes; however, a bottleneck in rapidly delivering appropriate patient care is the long time period for histologic assessment and lack of precision in predicting disease severity. Morphological assessments prevalent in histology are useful but resource intensive and not predictive enough. Molecular techniques to complement traditional pathology are emerging but often require much more effort and time, without being especially compatible with histologic assessments. Here, we seek to develop a technology that measures the chemical content of tissues, does not require reagents, is entirely compatible with clinical workflows and leverages modern artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to provide real-time histologic assessment. The foundation of our approach is a new design for an infrared spectroscopic imaging system that is faster than any reported, offers a higher spatial and spectral quality and uses a solid immersion lens with a fixed focus at the sealed surface of the lens to enable use by a minimally trained person. In conjunction with the instrument, we develop AI algorithms that measure the chemical content of tissue and use it to provide (a) conventional pathology images without the use of dyes (“stainless staining”), and (b) histologic assessment based on molecular data, which can provide complementary composition, disease and risk of lethal cancer images akin to conventional pathology. The instrument will be usable by laboratory technicians, without the need to prepare thin sections from excised tissue and will provide information in minutes. Using preliminary data from human patients on over 850 tissue microarray (TMA) samples from 8 TMAs and 30 surgical resections, we validate the use of technology in providing complete histologic and disease grade assessment. Statistical methods will be used to assess the results rigorously and quantitative milestones guide the entire approach. We then translate the results to fresh tissue chunks, providing histology minutes after tissue is extracted from the body. Finally, we use the detailed tumor and microenvironment information available from the tissue to segment patients into a “high risk” and “low risk” group. The availability of rapid histologic assessment can help prevent delays in providing care, provide intraoperative assessment, and add more information to morphologic assessments following screening, enabling a wide use in CRC and other cancer pathologies. Project Narrative Colorectal cancers (CRC) are among the leading causes of death from cancers in the US. Morphologically assessing excised tissue is the gold standard but requires fixation, staining, microscopy and pathology review, taking days and the information not being especially prognostic. This project develops an alternate technology based on chemical imaging evaluation that can provide an assessment within minutes, resulting in a new instrument, artificial intelligence methods for histology and microenvironment-powered prediction of disease course.",Real time colon histopathology by infrared spectroscopic imaging,10318008,R01CA260830,"['Analysis of Variance ', ' ANOVA ', ' Variance Analyses ', ' Archives ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Colon ', ' Color ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dyes ', ' Coloring Agents ', ' Electronics ', ' electronic device ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Histocompatibility Testing ', ' Tissue Crossmatching ', ' Tissue Typing ', ' histocompatibility typing ', ' Histology ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Microscopy ', ' Microtomy ', ' Thin Sectioning ', ' Modernization ', ' Persons ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Polyps ', ' Reagent ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' ROC Curve ', ' ROC Analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic curve ', ' seal ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Stains ', ' Staining method ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Laboratory Technicians ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Microscope ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Surface ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared ', ' FTIR ', ' FTIR spectroscopy ', ' Chemicals ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Fourier Transform ', ' Staging ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Route ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Laboratory Chemicals ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' experience ', ' human data ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Histopathology ', ' novel ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Reporting ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Lymph Node Involvement ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' design and construct ', ' design and construction ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Device ', ' Molecular Analysis ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Fresh Tissue ', ' Tissue Microarray ', ' Tissue Arrays ', ' Tissue Chip ', ' Validation ', ' technology validation ', ' technology implementation ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' sample fixation ', ' Fixation ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' tumor microenvironment ', ' cancer microenvironment ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' spectroscopic imaging ', ' imaging spectroscopy ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer imaging ', ' oncologic imaging ', ' oncology imaging ', ' tumor imaging ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Cancerous ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' high risk ', ' screening ', ' imaging system ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' improved outcome ', ' clinical translation ', ' rural setting ', ' rural locality ', ' rural place ', ' colorectal cancer treatment ', ' colo-rectal cancer therapy ', ' colo-rectal cancer treatment ', ' colorectal cancer therapy ', ' pathology imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' real-time images ', ' realtime image ', ' Immersion ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' coronavirus disease ', ' COVID ', ' CoV disease ', ' corona virus disease ', ' tissue archive ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2021,466088,IL-13
"ACILIA will be a low-cost kit with SaaS platform that integrates an embodied conversational agent using AI capabilities to provide educational information and emotional coping support PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Currently, 5.7 million people live with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD) in the United States, and this number is projected to reach 13.8 million by 2050. Two-thirds of individuals with ADRD live at home and as a result, approximately 15 million unpaid care partners, mostly family members, are increasingly required to perform complex tasks which causes them significant stress. The major contributors to care partners’ stress are: 1) having low confidence in their competency in their caregiving tasks, such as managing activities of daily living (ADLs), instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) and behavioral symptoms of ADRD as they change over the course of the disease and 2) being socially isolated with feelings of loneliness. Benten proposes to address these problems through creation of the Avatar Companion to Improve the Lives of Informal care partners of individuals with Alzheimer’s (ACILIA), a home kit with SaaS platform that integrates an embodied conversational agent using AI capabilities (i.e., emotion analysis, sentiment analysis and life-long machine learning [L3] algorithm), with home speakers, a smart watch, and mobile app, to support the CPs on the care journey. ACILIA will provide just-in--time guidance and support to care partners in addition to stage- appropriate education and training on how to manage caregiving tasks. It will also engage in natural conversations with the care partners detecting sentiments of stress and offering advice and support and connection to a virtual community. ACILIA aims to assist in reducing the family care partners’ stress levels by improving their competency and capabilities in providing care and by providing companionship and support, which will reflect positively on their quality of life and that of their loved ones living with ADRD and aging in place. During this Phase I project, we will develop of a prototype ACILIA using input from an advisory board of informal care partners and people living with ADRD. We will also conduct a pilot test for feasibility of ACILIA among 20 individuals who are in early-middle stage ADRD and their informal care partners to evaluate the usability and acceptance of ACILIA prototype. Successful completion of Phase I will lead to Phase II and evaluating its outcomes. improving informal care partners’ competency, reducing their feeling of loneliness, and reducing their stress levels in an adequately powered randomized controlled trial (RCT). PROJECT NARRATIVE User-centered design and pilot testing conducted for the Phase 1 development of ACILIA will make it possible to evaluate the feasibility of ACILIA to support informal care partners of PLWAD in their care efforts. In the long-term, Benten envisions ACILIA becoming a valuable tool for informal care partners, enabling them to perform their caregiving tasks more effectively by delivering just-in-time stage-appropriate training and stress- reduction support, and offering companionship throughout the journey of providing dementia care.",ACILIA will be a low-cost kit with SaaS platform that integrates an embodied conversational agent using AI capabilities to provide educational information and emotional coping support,10250533,R43AG069659,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Anger ', ' angers ', ' angry ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavioral Symptoms ', ' Chicago ', ' Communities ', ' Consultations ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Frustration ', ' Illinois ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Loneliness ', ' lonely ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Play ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social isolation ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Support ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Competence ', ' Family member ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Companions ', ' tool ', ' depressed ', ' sadness ', ' Depressed mood ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Services ', ' Education and Training ', ' Training and Education ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' IADL ', ' instrumental activity of daily living ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' caregiving ', ' care giving ', ' care burden ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' mindfulness-based stress reduction ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' user centered design ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' loved ones ', ' evidence base ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile device application ', ' online community ', ' on-line community ', ' virtual community ', ' informal care ', ' informal support ', ' dementia care ', ' smart watch ', ' smartwatch ', ' stress reduction ', ' aging in place ', ' age in place ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' feasibility testing ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIA,"BENTEN TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R43,2021,196867,VA-10
"Proteomic Analysis of Blood Plasma using High Throughput Sequencers Abstract  Aptamers made from DNA, RNA and other nucleic acids that have chemical modifications can be engineered to bind tightly to biomolecules like the proteins that circulate in blood.  The primary goal of this project is to develop a kit of aptamer reagents to enable simultaneous measurement of protein abundance profiles, focusing especially on significant differentially abundant proteins in blood. This will aid in cancer diagnostics and in monitoring protein populations over the course of disease and therapeutic intervention. The intended product is an Aptamer Proteomics kit (AP-kit) that can be used by researchers and clinicians to comprehensively profile the differences between healthy individuals and those afflicted with cancer. The kits will be validated in-house and tested with carefully curated samples focused on prostate cancer.  The AP-kits will give cancer scientists new tools that lead to breakthroughs in the understanding of cancer types and to create new and more effective treatments and preventions. Physicians will be enabled to diagnose tumors earlier, reducing the burden of radiation treatments and chemotherapy on cancer patients. AP-assays will aid in monitoring the progress of cancer therapies and allow treatments to be customized for individual patients. These outcomes will increase quality of life and substantially decrease the burden of cancer on society.

"In-Office, Ultrasound-Based Breakage and Removal of Urinary stones OVERALL SUMMARY  The main focus of this Program Project Grant is to discover the foundational and translational knowledge needed to create an office-based handheld ultrasound device to target, detach, break, and expel stones and stone fragments from the urinary space to facilitate natural clearance. This system will obviate costly and inefficient emergency department visits that typically include repetitive exposure to ionizing radiation from diagnostic imaging, and will significantly reduce the often lengthy (days to weeks) wait time patients must endure before procedures for stone removal can be scheduled and performed. As the proposed therapy system is entirely noninvasive, patients will be treated on an outpatient basis. Further, as the system is designed to efficiently and painlessly break stones of any size and expel the fragments from the kidney, the treatment of both symptomatic and asymptomatic stones using this technology will reduce the high retreatment and stone event recurrence rates associated with current surgical interventions for stone removal.  In this effort, we will combine stone breakage by burst wave lithotripsy (BWL), clearance of fragments by ultrasonic propulsion (UP), and stone-specific ultrasound imaging (S-mode) into an integrated system in which exposure strategies are adapted during treatment in response to real-time acoustic feedback to enhance comminution efficiency and patient safety. We will tailor treatment by investigating numerically and in lab tests the primary mechanisms - cavitation and elastic waves - involved in the comminution process over a broad parameter space. We will develop acoustics-based feedback including model- based, machine learning and passive acoustic mapping (PAM) of the bubble field to signal the need to adjust the energy output. We will investigate the morphological and functional response of the kidney in living animals and in ex vivo perfused porcine kidneys, and pursue tissue protective treatment strategies such as power ramping.  These studies will include the first in-human test of BWL in which we will compare the comminution effectiveness and safety of treatment with and without adaptive output control in response to acoustic feedback. In addition, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of the benefits and risks of fragmenting and expelling symptomatic and asymptomatic stones in the clinic. Toward application of the system for use in humans, we will refine and validate the use of UP and S-mode together to improve stone and fragment detection. With our eye on the future of stone management, we will develop and validate in vivo an extracorporeal acoustic tractor beam to grasp and carry fragments through the complex three- dimensional path of the urinary space and out of the kidney. OVERALL NARRATIVE Urinary stone disease, which affects 1 in 11 Americans, is one of the most painful diseases and also the costliest non-malignant urologic disease, because current management is limited to observation for the stone to pass or performing surgery. The main focus of this Program Project Grant is to discover the foundational and translational knowledge needed to create an office-based, handheld ultrasound device to target, detach, break, and expel stones and stone fragments from the urinary space to facilitate natural clearance. This system will obviate costly and temporizing emergency department visits and radiation exposing imaging while the patient waits in pain for days to weeks for the stone to pass or be surgically removed.","In-Office, Ultrasound-Based Breakage and Removal of Urinary stones",10192507,P01DK043881,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Affect ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Calibration ', ' Diagnostic Imaging ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Fracture ', ' bone fracture ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Lithotripsy ', ' Litholapaxy ', ' Methodology ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Productivity ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Ionizing radiation ', ' Ionizing Electromagnetic Radiation ', ' Radiation-Ionizing Total ', ' ionizing output ', ' Ramp ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Safety ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Family suidae ', ' Pigs ', ' Suidae ', ' Swine ', ' porcine ', ' suid ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' Urinary Calculi ', ' Urinary Stones ', ' Urinary Tract Stones ', ' Urolith ', ' Urologic Diseases ', ' Urinary Tract Diseases ', ' Urologic Disorder ', ' Urological Diseases ', ' Urological Disorders ', ' urinary tract disorder ', ' Measures ', ' Schedule ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' calcification ', ' Calcified ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' grasp ', ' Grips ', "" Bowman's space "", ' Urinary Space ', ' Painless ', ' non-painful ', ' nonpainful ', ' not painful ', ' Sample Size ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Exposure to ', ' Morphology ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' re-treatment ', ' Retreatment ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' American ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' patient safety ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Ultrasonic ', ' Ultrasonics ', ' Biostatistics Core ', ' Detection ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' P01 Mechanism ', ' P01 Program ', ' Program Project Grant ', ' Research Program Projects ', ' Program Research Project Grants ', ' Renal Tissue ', ' in vivo ', ' Non-Malignant ', ' nonmalignant ', ' Tissue Model ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' safety study ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' treatment strategy ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' individualized medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapeutic strategy ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' biomechanical model ', ' biomechanic modeling ', ' biomechanic simulation ', ' biomechanical modeling ', ' biomechanical simulation ', ' Radiation exposure ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' Wait Time ', ' first-in-human ', ' first in man ', ' complex data ', ' porcine model ', ' pig model ', ' piglet model ', ' swine model ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,P01,2021,1563076,WA-07
"Transcriptome-driven inference of adverse drug interactions ABSTRACT Ototoxicity is a debilitating side effect of over 150 medications, many of which are prescribed as part of multi- drug regimens to treat a broad range of conditions including cancer and recalcitrant infections. Adverse drug- drug interactions (DDIs) that potentiate ototoxicity complicate the implementation of multi-drug regimens, particularly to treat multiple concurrent conditions. In most cases, DDIs are currently detected only after the drugs are on the market, so effective preclinical methods to identify potential adverse interactions would facilitate safer co-prescriptions. The astronomical number of combinations renders measuring all possible drug interactions infeasible, so predicting how ototoxic drugs interact from data of individual compounds is necessary. While the current understanding of mechanisms underlying ototoxicity of specific drug classes has helped to explain clinical observations of specific adverse ototoxicity DDIs, and aided rational design of candidate otoprotective adjuvants, this strategy cannot anticipate adverse ototoxicity DDIs or develop otoprotectants for other lesser studied drug classes and first-in-class drugs under clinical development. To survey more broadly for potential ototoxicity DDIs, we will adapt INDIGO (Inferring Drug Interactions using chemo-Genomics and Orthology), a machine learning tool that currently can predict synergy/antagonism of antimicrobial drug activity in multiple bacterial species without requiring specific drug target information. We hypothesize that we can harness the underlying approach to predict potentially adverse (synergistic) or protective (antagonistic) ototoxic DDIs in humans, by building an “INDIGO-Tox” model based on data generated from an appropriate animal system. We will measure transcriptional profiles elicited by 15 drugs known to convey ototoxicity or otoprotection, as well as corresponding pairwise ototoxicity DDI phenotypes in zebrafish, a well-established in vivo model system for studying ototoxicity. We will use these data to train INDIGO-Tox model. We will then use INDIGO-Tox to predict DDIs between 10 additional drugs, using their zebrafish transcriptome response profiles as input data. We will validate predictions in zebrafish, and will test translation of top validated predictions in a well-established mouse ex vivo model of ototoxicity. We will also use the model to generate predictions for novel genes that influence ototoxicity, which we will then test in zebrafish. Successful completion will generate hypotheses for translation into humans, facilitate model expansion to assessing possible ototoxic interactions for a broader library of drugs, and will establish a path to predict interactions between ototoxicity and other organ toxicities. N AR R AT IVE Drug-induced hearing injury is a debilitating, often irreversible side-effect of certain lifesaving medicines that are often prescribed as part of multi-drug regimens. As adverse drug-drug interactions can exacerbate ototoxicity, novel effective preclinical methods to identify potential interactions would facilitate safer co- prescriptions.

"Personalized Predictions for Glaucoma Progression Using Artificial Intelligence for Electronic Health Records Project Summary/Abstract: Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness, affecting over 60 million people worldwide. Glaucoma patients vary widely in their presentation, with some retaining long-term disease stability, and others progressing quickly to vision loss. If glaucoma patients at highest risk of progression could be identified early, clinicians could better personalize their treatment approaches. Many clinical factors that affect glaucoma progression, such as intraocular pressure, treatment history, and medication adherence, are documented within the free-text notes of the electronic health records (EHR) and are not in large-scale administrative claims databases. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) have enabled the integration of the rich and complex EHR data into highly accurate predictive algorithms for health outcomes in medicine and surgery. We hypothesize that we can extend these AI and NLP techniques to build predictive algorithms for glaucoma progression that outperform traditional models reliant on only administrative features. The goal of this project is to build and evaluate predictive algorithms for glaucoma progression using large-scale EHR data, while developing Dr Wang's expertise in AI and NLP, advancing her career as an independent clinician scientist. Aim 1 focuses on using the structured clinical data within the EHR, which are numeric or coded and readily machine-readable, to build baseline machine learning models predicting glaucoma progression requiring surgery. Aim 2 focuses on using and augmenting clinical named entity recognition tools to integrate information from EHR free text into AI models predicting glaucoma progression to surgery. Aim 3 focuses on understanding, explaining, and evaluating the performance of AI algorithms in a real-world prospective setting, by evaluating their performance on key subpopulations, their reliance on key features, and investigating potential areas of bias in a new cohort of glaucoma patients. This proposal is innovative in developing AI-based predictive algorithms for glaucoma progression using numeric and textual clinical data uniquely available in the EHR. The tools and methods Dr Wang will build and evaluate will substantially impact the ophthalmology field by enabling evidence-based tailoring of treatment approaches to patients' unique clinical characteristics, a step towards precision medicine. Furthermore, the careful evaluation of AI predictive algorithms on a new cohort of patients will provide insights into their performance on key subpopulations and reliance on key features, which is critical to advancing our understanding of possible limitations of deploying AI in the clinical workflow. Dr. Wang's career and research will advance under the primary mentorship of Dr. Tina Hernandez-Boussard, a national leader in informatics and expert in using NLP on EHR to improve patient care. Her outstanding Advisory Committee, including clinician-investigators Drs. Pershing, Stein, Chang, and Goldberg, will ensure Dr. Wang's success in becoming an independent clinician-investigator integrating ophthalmology and informatics. Project Narrative/Public Health Statement: This project is relevant to public health in focusing on developing and evaluating predictive algorithms for glaucoma progression, which are necessary to tailor treatment approaches to individual glaucoma patients' needs and achieve optimal treatment outcomes to prevent blindness. The powerful artificial intelligence techniques we will develop and use for large-scale data from electronic health records can be extended to include a wide variety of data sources and shared with the research and clinical community to answer ophthalmic questions in many domains.

"A Network Science Approach to Conflicts of Interest: Metrics, Policies, and Communication Design The primary purpose of this project is to develop new metrics and mechanisms for the evaluation of conflicts of interest (COI) risks in the biomedical research enterprise. The innovation in COI risk evaluation and communication will draw on a shift away from the conceptualization of COI as a problem of individual researchers toward an understanding of COI as network phenomena. The pressing problems of COI and the bias it inculcates stem not from individuals but from the aggregation of COI across networks of researchers and funders. The research team will leverage machine-learning and high performance computing to (1) track the circulation of COI within biomedical decision networks, and (2) evaluate the extent to which certain conflict network profiles predict increased risks of patient harm. The team will test candidate COI metrics with U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Events Reporting System drug safety data. Using these data as a foundation, this project will also (3) develop and evaluate strategies for communicating COI risks of bias designed to safeguard against the perverse outcomes in current disclosure practices. The results of this research will underwrite novel evidence-based recommendations for COI policies in biomedical research as well as recommendations for more effective disclosure practices. To achieve these aims, this project will leverage machine-learning to identify systemic COI networks within the biomedical research enterprises for specific drug products. The research team will then evaluate to what extent network metrics predict relative increases in adverse event rates and severity for identified products. Concerns over the potential effects of industry funding and COI have been a recurrent feature in the study of the biomedical research enterprise and related clinical practice. Empowering researchers and policymakers with evidence-based approaches for the management of COIs in networks of research is essential for safeguarding the study of health and medicine and reducing the risk of negative effects on the practice of science and patients who rely on that science.","A Network Science Approach to Conflicts of Interest: Metrics, Policies, and Communication Design",10202242,R01GM141476,"['Biomedical Research ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Circulation ', ' Communication ', ' Disclosure ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Fees ', ' Industry ', ' Ink ', ' Patients ', ' PF4 Gene ', ' Antiheparin Factor ', ' Blood Platelet Factor IV ', ' Blood platelet factor 4 ', ' Chemokine (C-X-C motif) Ligand 4 ', ' Factor 4 ', ' Heparin Neutralizing Protein ', ' Platelet Factor 4 ', ' Recombinant Platelet Factor 4 ', ' SCYB4 ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine B4 ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine Subfamily B, Member 4 ', ' gamma-Thromboglobulin ', ' platelet factor IV ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' medication prescription ', ' prescribed medication ', ' Publishing ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' USFDA ', ' Universities ', ' Conflict of Interest ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' New Drug Approvals ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Consult ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' response ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Committee Members ', ' Institution ', ' Data ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' evidence based guidelines ', ' Evidence based practice guidelines ', ' evidence based recommendations ', ' drug testing ', ' drug detection ', ' financial relationship ', ' medication safety ', ' drug safety ', ' pharmaceutical safety ', ' ']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2021,215960,TX-10
"Omniview tethered capsule for low cost, non-endoscopic Barrett's esophagus screening in unsedated patients Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is among the most lethal malignancies with a 19% five-year survival rate and its incidence has increased several fold in the last decades. Barrett’s esophagus (BE) confers elevated risk for progression to EAC. Patients diagnosed with BE undergo periodic surveillance endoscopy with biopsies to detect dysplasia which can be treated by endoscopic eradication with radiofrequency ablation before it progresses to EAC. However, the majority of diagnosed EAC patients have not had prior screening endoscopy and present with advanced lesions that limit treatment options and result in poorer survival. The development of a rapid, low cost, well tolerated, non-endoscopic BE screening technique that can be performed in unsedated patients at points of care outside the endoscopy suite would improve BE detection and reduce EAC morbidity and mortality. Our program is a multidisciplinary collaboration among investigators at the Massachusetts Institute Technology and Veteran Affairs Boston Healthcare System / Harvard Medical School that integrates novel optical imaging and software design, preclinical studies in swine, clinical studies in patients, and advanced image processing / machine learning. Aim 1 will develop an omniview tethered capsule technology that generates a map of the esophageal mucosa over a multi-centimeter length of esophagus and a series of wide angle forward views to aid navigation as the capsule is swallowed or retracted. The images will resemble endoscopic white light or narrow band imaging, but will not suffer from perspective distortion present in standard endoscopic or video capsule images. This will facilitate development of automated BE detection algorithms as well as enhance their sensitivity and specificity. This aim will also perform imaging studies in swine as a translational step toward clinical studies. Aim 2 will determine reader sensitivity and specificity for BE detection versus standard endoscopy / biopsy and prepare data for developing automated BE detection. Patients undergoing screening as well as with history of BE undergoing surveillance will be recruited and unsedated capsule imaging will be performed on the same day prior to their endoscopy. Sensitivity and specificity for detecting BE will be assessed using multiple blinded readers and data sets suitable for developing automated BE detection algorithms will be developed. Aim 3 will develop image analysis methods for automated BE detection by investigating classifiers that operate on handcrafted features (colors and textures) and modern deep convolutional neural network methods for direct classification. If successful, this program will develop a rapid, low cost and scalable method for BE screening that would not require patient sedation, endoscopy, or tissue acquisition, and which could be performed in community primary care clinics. The procedure would be much faster and many times lower cost than endoscopy. Automated BE detection would enable immediate results for patient consultation and referral to gastroenterology if indicated. Larger patient populations with expanded risk criteria could be cost effectively screened and access to screening dramatically improved, reducing EAC mortality.

"2/2 Leveraging electronic health records for pharmacogenomics of psychiatric diorders Abstract  Schizophrenia (SCZ) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are highly heritable, debilitating diseases with lifetime prevalences of ~1% and 15%, respectively. Both disorders carry substantial morbidity and mortality and are associated with severe societal and personal costs. Despite the availability of efficacious treatments for both disorders, ~1/3 of individuals will not achieve symptomatic improvement even after multiple rounds of medication. Identifying individuals at greater risk for such treatment nonresponse, or treatment resistance, could facilitate more targeted interventions for these individuals.  A burgeoning literature has identified genomic variation associated with treatment response. In particular, antidepressant response has been suggested to be highly heritable; convergent data from rodent studies likewise suggest that antipsychotic and antidepressant response phenotypes are influenced by genetic variation. However, treatment studies to date have had minimal success in identifying variants associated with psychotropic response, likely as a result of limited sample sizes: prior efforts required sequential treatment trials and prospective assessment to characterize outcomes. Longitudinal electronic health records (EHR) data provide an opportunity to efficiently characterize treatment response in many individuals in real-world settings. Coupled with large and expanding biobanks, these cohorts allow for low- cost, large-scale genomic studies that finally achieve sufficient power to detect realistic effect sizes.  The investigators now propose to apply these approaches to the EHRs of two large regional health systems, each linked to a large biobank, to investigate treatment resistance in SCZ and MDD. They will apply canonical indicators of treatment resistance - clozapine treatment for SCZ, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for MDD - to identify coded and uncoded clinical features associated with high probability of treatment resistance in EHR data. These predictors will themselves provide a useful baseline for identifying high risk individuals. Then, they will apply these to study the entire affected population of each biobank, extending existing genomic data with additional genome-wide association, yielding more than 25,000 antidepressant-treated individuals and 2,200 antipsychotic-treated individuals. Rather than simply conducting a case-control study, they will examine treatment resistance as a quantitative trait, applying a method developed by the investigators and shown to substantially increase power for such traits.  The project combines expertise in clinical informatics, machine learning, and analysis of large scale genomics, as well as domain-specific expertise in psychiatric treatment resistance. Spanning two distinct health systems, the algorithms and methods developed have maximal portability, facilitating next- step investigations. Successful identification of risk variants will facilitate efforts at clinical risk stratification as well as investigation of the biology underlying treatment resistance. Public Health Statement Despite the availability of effective treatments for schizophrenia and major depressive disorder, around 1/3 of individuals will not have symptomatic improvement after multiple treatment trials.

"Multi-stable Compliant-Mechanism-based Mattress for Bedsore Prevention Abstract Pressure ulcers or decubitus ulcers, more commonly known as bedsores are a huge problem affecting 2.5 million patients every year in the US and causes 60,000 deaths every year. Pressures exceeding 32 mm of Hg in the bony prominences in the back of the patient body lead to bedsores. Despite the existing low air loss mattresses, alternating pressure mattresses and the state-of-the-art air fluidized beds, bedsores prevail, and its prevention remains a huge healthcare challenge. Current hospital protocol is to turn patient every two hours. This is very disturbing and cause of pain to a resting patient who is dealing with other co-existing health conditions besides bedsores. Caregivers and nurses must turn heavy patients around, which sometimes lead to hurting their backs in the process. When not performed adequately and frequently (every 2 hours) as required, it is considered as negligence of care and causes litigation against nursing homes and hospitals causing huge financial losses to them. We propose a compliant-mechanism- based mattress that will obsolete the current clinical protocol of nurses and caregivers having to turn the patient every two hours. It will operate with minimal power, make small clicking noise when changing from one stable state to another using amount of force required to open a desk drawer. This switching of states can be further automated and can include a simple counter for documented evidence of alternating pressure to support against litigation of negligent care. In specific aim 1, machine learning using trained neural network will determine the functional requirements of the mattress (e.g., optimal amplitude and pitch for the undulation of the pressure points) by conducting a cohort pressure profile study that involves a bed that intentionally applies pressure on resting bodies. In specific aim 2, ideal topology with pitch and amplitude of undulations discovered in aim 1 will be developed using FACT and optimized using BLOT to create a prototype bi-stable compliant-mechanism-based mattress as a new approach for shifting pressure points on a patient’s body. FACT is advanced technique using freedom and constraint topologies for topology synthesis of the mattress and BLOT provides boundary layer optimization of the topology. Proposed mattress is innovative, disruptive, affordable, lightweight, does not use noisy air pumps, has no leakage issues and will eliminate the scourge of bedsores in the existing immobile and aging population. Project Narrative Numerous currently marketed alternating pressure mattresses have not received recommendations from reviewers due to poor correlation and unconvincing outcomes for bedsore prevention. Our approach of using neural network based machine learning will bring a new methodical approach to discerning the pitch and amplitude of undulations required to prevent dead pressure zones that exceed safe pressure of 32 mm of Hg on the patient’s back, which is fundamental to preventing bedsores. This will further serve as input to designing the prototype compliant-mechanism-based mattress using the freedom and constraint topologies (FACT) approach and the boundary learning optimization tool (BLOT) with end effect of developing an innovative mattress for preventing bedsores in the immobile and aging population.",Multi-stable Compliant-Mechanism-based Mattress for Bedsore Prevention,10138288,R41NR019721,"['Affect ', ' Air ', ' Air Pressure ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Beds ', ' Body Weight ', ' Clinical Protocols ', ' Computers ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' decubitus ulcer ', ' Bed Sores ', ' Bedsore ', ' Pressure Sore ', ' Pressure Ulcer ', ' pressure injury ', ' Extravasation ', ' Leakage ', ' Spillage ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Mattresses ', ' Methods ', ' Negligence ', ' Noise ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' pressure ', ' Recommendation ', ' Rest ', ' Shoulder ', ' Work ', ' Litigation ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Nursing Protocols ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Pump ', ' improved ', ' Training ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' lightweight ', ' light weight ', ' tool ', ' Filamentous Fungi ', ' Molds ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Hour ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Width ', ' Height ', ' cohort ', ' Scourge ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Network-based ', ' prototype ', ' aging population ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' Geometry ', ' Injections ', ' neural network ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' ']",NINR,K MEDICAL LLC,R41,2021,251440,CA-30
"Integrating Ethics into Machine Learning for Precision Medicine The application of new computerized methods of data analysis to vast collections of medical, biological, and other data is emerging as a central feature of a broad vision of precision medicine (PM) in which systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) assist clinicians in treatment, diagnosis, or prognosis. The use of AI to analyze big data for clinical decision-making opens up a new domain for ELSI inquiry to address a possible future when the implications of genetics and genomics become embedded into algorithms, pervasive yet implicit and difficult to identify. Thus, an important target of inquiry is the development and developers of these algorithms. There are three distinctive features of the application of AI, and in particular machine learning (ML), to the domain of PM that create the need for ELSI inquiry. First, the process of developing ML-based systems for PM goals is technically and organizationally complex. Thus, members of development teams will likely have different expertise and assumptions about norms, responsibilities, and regulation. Second, machine learning does not solely operate through predetermined rules, and is thus difficult to hold accountable for its conclusions or reasoning. Third, designers of ML systems for PM may be subject to diverse and divergent interests and needs of multiple stakeholders, yet unaware of the associated ethical and values implications for design. These distinctive features of ML in PM could lead to difficulties in detecting misalignment of design with values, and to breakdown in responsibility for realignment. Because machine learning in the context of precision medicine is such a new phenomenon, we have very little understanding of actual practices, work processes and the specific contexts in which design decisions are made. Importantly, we have little knowledge about the influences and constraints on these decisions, and how they intersect with values and ethical principles. Although the field of machine learning for precision medicine is still in its formative stage, there is growing recognition that designers of AI systems have responsibilities to ask such questions about values and ethics. In order to ask these questions, designers must first be aware that there are values expressed by design. Yet, there are few practical options for designers to learn how to increase awareness. Our specific aims are: Aim 1 To map the current state of ML in PM by identifying and cataloging existing US-based ML in PM  projects and by exploring a range of values expressed by stakeholders about the use of ML in PM through  a combination of multi-method review, and interviews of key informants and stakeholders. Aim 2 To characterize decisions and rationales that shape ML in PM and explore whether and how  developers perceive values as part of these rationales through interviews of ML developers and site visits. Aim 3 To explore the feasibility of using design rationale as a framework for increasing awareness of the  existence of values, and multiple sources of values, in decisions about ML in PM through group-based  exercises with ML developers from academic and commercial settings. The overall goal of this project is to understand how to encourage and enable people who are developing artificial intelligence for personalized health care to be aware of values in their daily practice. We will examine actual practices and contexts in which design decisions are made for precision medicine applications, and use this information to design group-based workshop exercises to increase awareness of values.",Integrating Ethics into Machine Learning for Precision Medicine,10136061,R01HG010476,"['Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Awareness ', ' Cataloging ', ' Computers ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Engineering ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Evolution ', ' Exercise ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Scholarship ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' member ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Regulation ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Site Visit ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' informant ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' ethical legal social implication ', ' ELSI ', ' ethical, legal, and social ', ' computerized ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' personalized health care ', ' personalized healthcare ', ' precision health care ', ' precision healthcare ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,579506,CA-18
"Radiomics and Pathomics to predict upstaging of DCIS Abstract  Ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS) of the breast are a heterogeneous group of neoplastic lesions that are usually detected by screening mammography. Workup generally includes a percutaneous (core) Biopsy (Bx) for histologic confirmation, followed by multiparametric MRI (mpMRI), followed by breast-conserving excision, and adjuvant radiation. Approximately 20-25% of patients with core Bx-confirmed DCIS are upstaged to invasive carcinoma upon pathology of resected tissue. Foreknowledge of this would dictate a more aggressive surgical intervention, including sentinel node biopsy for axillary staging. Further, another 20-25% of patients are judged to have low-risk disease and current thought is that such women may have better outcomes in an active surveillance setting, and this is being tested in clinical trials. The ultimate goal and the overall impact of this project is to use machine learning to identify biochemical (SA1) or imaging (SA2) biomarkers, as well as their combination (SA3) to discriminate indolent from aggressive DCIS, as determined by upstaging upon excisional biopsy.  The major hypothesis to be tested in this work is that hypoxia and expression of hypoxia-related proteins (HRPs) can discriminate aggressive from more indolent DCIS, and that this can be used for decision support. Expression of HRPs is optimally characterized by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and we have deployed methods for multiplexed IHC, as well as methods for advanced analytics using machine learning (pathomics). We have also shown that hypoxic habitats within breast cancers can be identified from mpMRI using machine learning (radiomics). We thus propose to use pathomics of core biopsies and radiomics of mpMRI to determine the presence and extent of hypoxic habitats in DCIS prior to surgery to predict subsequent upstaging after surgical resection. This work will be performed in Aim 1 for pathomics and Aim 2 for radiomics, and Aim 3 will develop combined radio-pathomics predictors. Each aim will contain: (a) retrospective arms for training, tuning, and testing; and (b) prospective internal and external cohorts for rigorous validation. For the retrospective studies, we have identified 604 cases wherein women with DCIS obtained core Bx, mpMRI, and surgery with pathology at Moffitt in the last 10 years. Internal prospective studies will accrue ~6 women/month who have consented to the total Cancer Care® protocol and who have their complete workup at Moffitt. External validation cohorts will be accrued at UCSF and at Advent Health.  At the end of this work we will have developed a risk model for DCIS that can be deployed prior to surgery to guide decisions along the spectrum from active surveillance at one end to more extensive surgical intervention at the other. This is expected to lay a foundation for subsequent interventional trials. Additionally, the inclusion of hypoxia as a central hypothesis has high potential to illuminate components of the natural history of this disease. Narrative  Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is one of the most commonly diagnosed malignancies of the breast and data are lacking with regard to optimal treatment. Consequently, the majority of DCIS are treated in the same manner: i.e. surgery +/- radiation +/- hormonal therapy that results in either over- or under-treatment of many patients. In the current work we will test the hypothesis that histologic or radiologic markers prior to surgery can guide decision support by identifying predicting up-staging and pathological risk scoring following surgical excision.",Radiomics and Pathomics to predict upstaging of DCIS,10120171,R01CA249016,"['Lesion ', ' Indolent ', ' Hypoxia ', ' Hypoxic ', ' Oxygen Deficiency ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' hormone therapy ', ' Endocrine Therapy ', ' Hormonal Therapy ', ' Clinical Paths ', ' Staging ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' cohort ', ' disease natural history ', ' Adjuvant Therapy ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' validation studies ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Duct ', ' Duct (organ) structure ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Sentinel Node Biopsy ', ' Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Radiation ', ' Modeling ', ' Habitats ', ' cancer care ', ' Formalin ', ' Radio ', ' Core Needle Biopsy ', ' Core Biopsy ', ' Erythrocyte/Hepatoma Glucose Transporter ', ' GLUT ', ' GLUT1 ', ' Glucose Transporter 1 ', ' SLC2A1 ', ' Solute Carrier Family 2, Facilitated Glucose Transporter, Member 1 ', ' SLC2A1 gene ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Multiparametric Analysis ', ' precancerous ', ' premalignant ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Resected ', ' Process ', ' Adjuvant ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' neoplastic ', ' preclinical study ', ' pre-clinical study ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' Heritability ', ' practical application ', ' application in practice ', ' tumor ', ' standard of care ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' arm ', ' Breast Carcinogenesis ', ' Mammographic screening ', ' mammography screening ', ' contrast enhanced ', ' breast malignancies ', ' Metastatic breast cancer ', ' radiomics ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' Retrospective cohort ', ' optimal treatments ', ' optimal therapies ', ' deep learning ', ' advanced analytics ', ' Acidosis ', ' Antibodies ', ' Attention ', ' Axilla ', ' Armpit ', ' Axillary ', ' Underarm ', ' Biopsy ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Carcinoma ', ' Epithelial cancer ', ' Malignant Epithelial Neoplasms ', ' Malignant Epithelial Tumors ', ' epithelial carcinoma ', ' Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' DCIS ', ' Ductal Breast Carcinoma In Situ ', ' Ductal Carcinoma In Situ ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Invasive Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Evolution ', ' Foundations ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hyperplasia ', ' Hyperplastic ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Mammography ', ' Mammogram ', ' mammographic Imaging ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' mammographic exams ', ' Methods ', ' Milk ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Pathology ', ' Surgical Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Phenotype ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Proteins ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Receiver Operating Characteristics ', ' Receiver Operator Characteristics ', ' Retrospective Studies ', ' Risk ', ' Stains ', ' Staining method ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Tissue Embedding ', ' Paraffin Embedding ', ' base ', ' Excision biopsy ', ' Excisional Biopsy ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Biochemical ', ' Training ', ' ']",NCI,H.

"Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and Data Science Techniques Despite their adverse impact on patient quality of life and healthcare utilization and costs, symptom clusters (SCs) in common adult chronic conditions such as cancer, heart failure (HF), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are understudied and poorly understood. The lack of access to real world, longitudinal patient symptom data sets and inability to adequately model the complexity of SCs has greatly limited research. Based on our previous work, we propose that these gaps can be addressed in an innovative way using electronic health records (EHRs) and data science techniques. Our overall objective is to develop, apply and refine, and implement an optimized data processing and analysis pipeline for the characterization of SCs in common adult chronic conditions for use with EHR data. We hypothesize that a core set of SCs is shared among all common adult chronic conditions and that distinct SCs characterize specific conditions and/or treatments. The long term training goal of this project is to assist Dr. Koleck in becoming an independent investigator conducting a program of research dedicated to mitigating symptom burden in patients with chronic conditions through use of informatics and omics (e.g., genomics and proteomics), the focus of her pre-doctoral work. Using exceptional resources available from Columbia University, the K99 phase of this project will focus on the development of a rigorous pipeline; essential competencies in SC analysis and interpretation; and the data science techniques of clinical data mining, natural language processing, machine learning, and data visualization. In the R00 phase, Dr. Koleck will independently implement the pipeline in another medical center to determine the reproducibility of identified SCs and begin to explore clinical predictors (e.g., socio-demographics, laboratory results, and medications) of SCs. The specific aims are to 1) develop a data-driven pipeline for the characterization of SCs from EHRs using a cohort of adult patients diagnosed with cancer, as SCs have been most systematically characterized in this condition; 2) apply the pipeline to three other common adult chronic conditions that share biological and behavioral risk factors with cancer, i.e., HF, T2DM, and COPD, and evaluate SCs in these conditions; and 3) determine if SCs differ for cancer, HF, T2DM, and COPD when implementing the pipeline within another medical center and explore clinically relevant, EHR- documented predictors of identified SCs. To accomplish research aims and training goals, an interdisciplinary team of scientists with expertise in symptom science, biomedical informatics, data science, pertinent clinical domains, and career development mentorship has been assembled. This research is significant because a pipeline that accommodates the format in which symptom data is already being documented in EHRs has the potential to greatly accelerate the acquisition of SC knowledge and expedite clinical translation of symptom mitigation strategies. Given the array of new competencies to be developed, this K99/R00 award is necessary for achieving the candidate’s career goal of advancing chronic condition symptom science. The proposed research is relevant to public health because adult patients diagnosed with chronic conditions are frequently burdened by two or more co-occurring, related symptoms. Development of an optimized process to study multiple symptoms collected in patient electronic health records has the potential to lead to new knowledge and improved symptom management. The proposed research addresses the NINR theme of “symptom science” and a key area in the NINR Strategic Plan, “taking advantage of innovations in data science in order to develop interventions to promote health and wellness that are leading-edge, effective, and translatable to clinical practice.”",Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and

"Rosie the Chatbot: Leveraging Automated and Personalized Health Information Communication to Reduce Disparities in Maternal and Child Health PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposal has the potential to alter the way health information is presented to vulnerable populations. Our proposal promotes a more flexible and tailored approach to reach underserved groups. Racial/ethnic minority women are at increased risk for postpartum depression, and their children as less likely to have had well-child checkups in the past year. Moreover, racial/ethnic disparities are still prevalent for maternal and infant mortality as well as various health behaviors such as safe sleep practices, breastfeeding, and infant nutrition. Currently, some popular programs involve resource-intensive home visits (limited in scale due to staff and cost constraints) or non-personalized text messages (may not directly address an individual’s questions). We propose the development of a chatbot that addresses both of these possible limitations by representing a scalable tool that can have widespread reach across geographies and is personalized and responsive to an individual’s specific informational needs. We have built a prototype of the chatbot, Rosie, capable of engaging in live question-and-answer sessions. Rosie is able to respond to 334 popular questions that new mothers may have. Pretests with mother groups and Mary’s Center patients have showed a positive reception to the chatbot. Over the course of the grant, we will leverage recent advances in natural language processing and the emergence of efforts to aggregate massive amounts of health information, to assemble a comprehensive health information library. We will further refine Rosie’s dialogue analyzer and response inference engine to robustly recognize and respond to user’s questions in the various and complex ways they can phrase a question. We will test the hypothesis that Rosie may lower risk of postpartum depression, decrease emergency room visits, and increase attendance of well-baby visits. We will employ primarily a virtual recruitment strategy to conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of this intervention on maternal and infant outcomes. Our investigative team—comprised of experts in the field of epidemiology, computer science, biostatistics, and maternal and child health experts—is uniquely suited to implement the study aims. Our Specific Aims are: 1) Develop technology for a chatbot, Rosie, that will provide health informational support to vulnerable mothers the moment they need it; 2) Evaluate the use of Rosie on maternal and infant outcomes; and 3) Release an open-source packet for the construction of a chatbot. Rosie provides informational support to vulnerable moms the moment they need it and safeguards new moms from misinformation that is common on the web with the ultimate goal of closing the gap in maternal and infant outcomes. Results and tools developed from this proposal can be utilized to inform population-based strategies to reduce health disparities and improve health. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Racial/ethnic disparities are still prevalent for maternal and infant outcomes, and popular programs for vulnerable populations involve resource-intensive home visits or non-personalized health information materials. We propose the development of a chatbot that addresses both of these possible limitations by representing a scalable tool that can have widespread reach across geographies and is personalized and responsive to an individual’s specific informational needs. Results from our project can be utilized to inform strategies to reduce health disparities by lowering barriers to timely and verified health information.",Rosie the Chatbot: Leveraging Automated and Personalized Health Information Communication to Reduce Disparities in Maternal and Child Health,10173272,R01MD016037,"['Algorithms ', ' Anxiety ', ' Appointment ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Color ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Immunization ', ' Immunologic Sensitization ', ' Immunologic Stimulation ', ' Immunological Sensitization ', ' Immunological Stimulation ', ' Immunostimulation ', ' Infant Mortality ', ' Infant Mortality Total ', ' infant nutrition ', ' Libraries ', ' Maternal Mortality ', ' maternal death ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mothers ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Friends ', ' Misinformation ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Left ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Postpartum Depression ', ' Post-Natal Depression ', ' Post-Partum Depression ', ' Postnatal Depression ', ' Individual ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Visit ', ' health care organization ', ' healthcare organization ', ' healthcare service organization ', ' health care service organization ', ' stressor ', ' Check-up ', ' checkup ', ' checkup examination ', ' computer science ', ' Informatics ', ' phrases ', ' Participant ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' health organization ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' child birth ', ' Childbirth ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Maternal and Child Health ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Health Professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Home visitation ', ' House Call ', ' home visit ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' Underserved Population ', ' under served group ', ' under served people ', ' under served population ', ' underserved group ', ' underserved people ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Back to Sleep ', ' Safe Sleep ', ' Safe to Sleep Campaign ', ' scale up ', ' cost effective ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' open source ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' ethnoracial ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' infant outcome ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' prototype ', ' population based ', ' web page ', ' webpage ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' online community ', ' on-line community ', ' virtual community ', ' family support ', ' personalized approach ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' precision approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' Breastfed infant ', ' Breast fed infant ', ' breast feeding infant ', ' breastfeeding infant ', ' recruit ', ' Text Messaging ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' care outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' community clinic ', ' screening guidelines ', ' recommended screening ', ' screening recommendations ', ' chatbot ', ' chat bot ', ' maternal outcome ', ' Well Child Visits ', ' ']",NIMHD,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2021,597635,MD-05
"Prevalence effects in visual research: Theoretical and practical implications Low prevalence searches form an important and problematic class of visual search tasks. These are tasks where the search target is rare. Many socially important tasks like airport security or cancer screening are low prevalence tasks. Previous work, much of it from our lab, has shown that low prevalence can have undesirable effects. Most notably, miss (false negative) errors are markedly elevated at low prevalence. This is a clear problem if the purpose of the search is to detect something rare but important like cancer or a terrorist threat. Our previous work has documented this pattern of increased miss errors in a number of expert domains including cytology (cervical cancer screening), airport baggage screening, and breast cancer screening. False alarm (false positive) error rates typically decline at low prevalence, moving in the opposite direction from miss errors. This indicates a shift in the observer’s decision criterion. At low prevalence, observers become more reluctant to call something a target. Several studies – ours and others - have shown that this “conservative” criterion shift is not adequate to explain the entire prevalence effect. Wolfe and VanWert (2010) developed a “Dual- Threshold” model that better captures the important aspects of the prevalence effect data by proposing two effects of low prevalence: (1) the conservative shift in the criterion for deciding if an attended item is a target, and (2) a lowering of the “quitting threshold.” The quitting threshold determines when observers end a search. Quitting too soon also increases the chance that the observer will miss a target. Prevalence effects have been studied in experimental isolation from other aspects of search. However, in tasks like breast cancer screening, other factors interact with prevalence. The four projects in the present proposal each investigate one of these interactions. Project 1 examines the relationship of prevalence to the “vigilance decrements” that are seen as time elapses in a task. In search, observers must maintain an internal, mental representation of the search target (or targets). Project 2 is concerned with the impact of prevalence on these “target templates”. Advances in artificial intelligence (notably deep learning) are producing tools to assist expert searchers. However, once deployed, these AI tools have been less effective than theory predicts. Project 3 tests the hypothesis that part of the problem is another side-effect of low prevalence and the project tests a potential intervention. Finally, clinicians, searching for one type of target (e.g. pneumonia) are supposed to report signs of other possible problems (e.g. lung cancer). Project 4 probes the role of prevalence in the failure to report such “incidental findings”. Again, we test several interventions. This is “use-inspired, basic research” whose results will provide guidance for experts performing socially important low prevalence tasks. Important tasks like breast cancer screening involve visual search for rare (“low prevalence”)  targets but, unfortunately, low prevalence is known to increase the percentage of targets that are  missed even by well-trained experts. In a task like breast cancer screening, prevalence interacts  with other factors like observer vigilance or the effectiveness of an artificial intelligence tool.  This proposal studies four of these interactions with the goal of counteracting the malign effects  of prevalence; thus making it possible for experts to perform their critical search tasks more  effectively.",Prevalence effects in visual research: Theoretical and practical implications,10111519,R01EY017001,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cytology ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybrids ', ' Joints ', ' Methods ', ' Paper ', ' Pneumonia ', ' Prevalence Study ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Talents ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Flecks ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Visual ', ' Trust ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' lung cancer ', ' analog ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' Performance ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' vigilance ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Incidental Findings ', ' Modeling ', ' visual search ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' mammary screening ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Low Prevalence ', ' Security ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Prevalence ', ' mental representation ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' deep learning ', ' side effect ', ' ']",NEI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,441020,MA-07
"Data-driven shared decision-making to reduce symptom burden in atrial fibrillation PROJECT SUMMARY Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia with symptoms that directly impair health-related quality of life (HRQoL). While catheter ablation is routinely performed to reduce AF symptoms and improve HRQoL, we lack evidence about which symptoms are likely to improve and for which patients. Ablations themselves may cause complications that lead to lower HRQoL. Shared decision-making (SDM) is a widely encouraged practice to navigate such complex choices by aligning treatment benefits and risks with the patient's stated values. However, no SDM interventions have focused explicitly on AF symptoms due to a lack of rigorous evidence about post-ablation symptom patterns and the decision aids necessary to communicate those findings. In this K99/R00 application, we propose to use data from electronic health records (EHRs) to characterize post-ablation symptom patterns, and display them in decision-aid visualizations to support personalized SDM about the best treatment modalities for an individual's patient's AF symptoms. In the K99 phase, we will use natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to extract and analyze symptom data from narrative notes in EHRs. We will also employ a rigorous, user-centered design protocol created during my postdoctoral work to develop decision-aid visualizations. In the R00 phase, we will conduct a feasibility study in which the interactive decision-aid visualizations are introduced during consultations about ablation in clinical electrophysiology practices. Our specific aims are: (1) identify common symptom patterns in patients with paroxysmal AF post-catheter ablation (n>32,014); (2) develop and evaluate decision-aid visualizations of common AF symptom patterns (n=50); and (3) evaluate the feasibility of implementing the decision-aid visualizations in clinical practice (n=75). The training objectives of this project include mastering competencies in NLP, ML, human-computer interaction, symptom science, and implementation science. The long-term training goal is to assist Dr. Reading Turchioe to become a faculty member with an independent program of research. She seeks to lead an interdisciplinary team of scientists and clinicians committed to improving symptom management and HRQoL for individuals living with AF and other chronic cardiovascular conditions, with an eye towards health equity. To ensure success for the planned research and training activities, a multidisciplinary team of mentors with complementary expertise, established, well-funded programs of research, and a record of mentoring high-quality trainees will advise her. Moreover, this research will be conducted in a world-class academic medical center with exceptional resources for building and implementing technology and data science methods using EHR data. The proposed research is both significant and innovative: NLP and ML methods to extract EHR data for decision-aid visualizations are a novel approach to SDM in the understudied area of AF symptoms. Together, these techniques promise to enhance HRQoL for other AF treatment modalities (e.g. medications, lifestyle changes) and other chronic cardiovascular conditions. ! ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Our research has public health significance because atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and expected to double in prevalence in the next decade as the population ages. “Real-world evidence” from electronic health record data displayed in personalized decision-aid visualizations can enable patients and providers to choose together the optimal treatments for symptom reduction. Our proposal addresses NINR's key areas of “Symptom Science: Promoting Personalized Health Strategies” and “Promoting Innovation: Technology to Improve Health” by leveraging innovative technologies to deliver personalized interventions that reduce symptom burden and improve quality of life for individuals with chronic conditions. !",Data-driven shared decision-making to reduce symptom burden in

"Biomechanical Analysis in Strabismus Surgery We propose 3 interrelated aims to define the biomechanics of the eye rotating (extraocular) muscles (EOMs) & optic nerve (ON) in health & visual disease, understand novel EOM actions, & characterize mechanical effects that may contribute to severe myopia. We aim to improve treatment of strabismus, misalignment of visual directions of the eyes; glaucoma & non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NA-AION), both common blinding ON diseases; & high axial myopia, an ocular elongation & distortion that has become a worldwide epidemic & major cause of blindness. We propose a novel & critical nexus linking the EOMs, ON, & structure of the eye's scleral wall that we will explore using modern imaging & artificial intelligence techniques. Aim I will clarify the kinematic (motion) properties of the human eye, testing by multipositional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the eyeball & EOMs the hypothesis that translational (linear) movement contributes importantly to ocular alignment. MRI will be performed during horizontal convergence & vertical eye rotation in normal people, & in patients who have common forms of strabismus including convergence insufficiency, eye crossing (esotropia), & outward ocular deviation (exotropia), both before & after corrective EOM surgery. Clarification of ocular translation is necessary to understand normal ocular motility and treat its disorders. Aim II will characterize the mechanical loading on the ON caused by eye movements. We will characterize the mechanical effects of ON tractional loading on the eyeball during horizontal & vertical eye rotations at 2 scales in living people, to test the hypothesis that such ON loading deforms it & adjacent retina & blood vessels as loading translates the eye. We propose that the resulting deformation during eye movements may create repetitive strain injury contributing to glaucoma, NA-AION, & axial myopia. In groups of subjects with the foregoing diseases, & in an equal group of matched healthy subjects, we will study mechanical effects of eye movement within the living eye by imaging its internal micro structure & blood vessels with optical coherence tomography, & outside the eyeball in the eye socket using MRI. Effects of tethering during eye movement will be studied ex vivo by precision 3D optical imaging of fresh human eye bank specimens subjected to mechanical tension on the ON that mimic effects of the eye movements imaged in the living subjects. Aim III will model the biomechanics of ocular kinematics. The constitutive mechanical properties of the non-muscular ocular & eye socket tissues will be described by finite element models (FEMs) using modern engineering methods for computational simulation to predict ocular kinematics, as well as local mechanical strains in the ON & sclera that may cause glaucoma, NA-AION, & the ocular deformities underlying extreme nearsightedness. We will determine if FEMs employing normal tissue properties can simulate normal ocular translation during horizontal & vertical rotations & convergence. By FEM simulation, we will also test the hypothesis that ocular loading by eye movement might contribute to: normal vergence, strabismus, & the effects of strabismus surgery. Relevance. Strabismus is a common clinical disorder that can cause double vision in adults and vision loss in children. Strabismus is often treated by surgical manipulation of the eye muscles, although current knowledge of their structure and function is incomplete. Proposed functional imaging and biomechanical studies of the properties of the eye muscles, eyeball, and optic nerve will improve understanding of the causes and treatment of strabismus, optic nerve diseases, and nearsightedness.",Biomechanical Analysis in Strabismus Surgery,10134346,R01EY008313,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', '

"Mining Social Media Big Data for Toxicovigilance: Automating the Monitoring of Prescription Medication Abuse via Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Methods Project Summary The problem of prescription medication (PM) abuse has reached epidemic proportions in the United States. According to a 2014 report by the Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), an estimated 52 million people, have been involved in the non-medical use of PMs— a significant portion of which can be classified as abuse. PMs that are commonly abused include opioids, central nervous system depressants and stimulants, and the consequences of their abuse may be severe. Increases in PM misuse and abuse over the last 15 years have resulted in increased emergency department visits, rates of addiction and overdose deaths. Due to the rapidly escalating morbidity and mortality, it is now receiving national attention. The opioid crisis, which has its root in opioid-based PM abuse, has been declared a national emergency by the president of the United States. Despite the problems associated with PM abuse, surveillance programs such as prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) are inadequate and suffer from numerous shortcomings, thus limiting their usefulness in real life. Studies evaluating the long-term effects of distinct classes of PMs on cohorts of abusers are scarce and expensive to conduct. To better characterize the problem and to monitor it in real-time, new sources of information need to be identified and novel monitoring techniques need to be developed. To address these problems, our project aims to utilize social media data for performing toxicovigilance. Social media encapsulates an abundance of knowledge about PM abuse and the abusers in the form of noisy natural language text. At the heart of the proposed approach is a machine learning system that can automatically distinguish between `abuse' and `non-abuse' indicating user posts collected from social media. Using this classification system, users will be categorized into multiple groups—(i) abusers, (ii) medical users and (iii) non users. The developed system will collect longitudinal data for users exposed the selected PMs via periodic collection of their publicly available posts/discussions and automatically categorize them based on age, gender and additional demographic feature, when possible. This will enable the conducting of observational studies on targeted cohorts, involving hundreds of thousands of cohort members. The cohort studies will focus on analyzing the transition rates from medical use to abuse for distinct PMs and transition rates from abuse of PMs to illicit analogs. Implementation of this data-centric framework, which will be open source, will revolutionize the mechanism by which PM abuse monitoring is performed and enable the future development of intervention strategies targeted towards specific cohorts, at the most effective time periods. Narrative Prescription Medication (PM) abuse is a major epidemic in the United States, and monitoring and studying the characteristics of the PM abuse problem requires the development of novel approaches. Social media encapsulates an abundance of data about PM abuse from different demographics, but extracting that data and converting it to knowledge requires advanced natural language processing and data-centric artificial intelligence systems. Our proposed social media mining framework will automate the process of big data to knowledge conversion for PM abuse, providing crucial insights to toxicologists about targeted populations and enabling the future development of directed intervention strategies.",Mining Social Media Big Data for Toxicovigilance: Automating the Monitoring of Prescription Medication Abuse via Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Methods,10167665,R01DA046619,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Attention ', ' Automation ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Benzodiazepines ', ' Benzodiazepine Compounds ', ' Central Nervous System Depressants ', ' CNS Depressants ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Heroin ', ' Diacetylmorphine ', ' Diamorphine ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' abuses drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Epidemic ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Fentanyl ', ' Actiq ', ' Duragesic ', ' Fentanest ', ' Fentyl ', ' Phentanyl ', ' Forensic Medicine ', ' Forensics ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heart ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Mining ', ' Morbidity -

"SCH:Smartphone Wound Image Parameter Analysis and Decision Support in Mobile Env PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): Chronic wounds affect 6.5 million patients in the U.S., with an estimated treatment cost of $25 billion. Our team proposes research to advance our existing NSF-funded smartphone wound analysis system, which helps patients monitor their diabetic foot ulcers, providing them with instant feedback on healing progress. Our wound system analyzes a smartphone image of the patients' wound, detects the wound area and tissue composition, and generates a proprietary healing score by comparing the current image with a past image. Our envisioned chronic wound assessment system will support evidence-based decisions by the care team while visiting patients, and move wound care toward digital objectivity. We define digital objectivity as the synthesis of wound assessment metrics that are extracted autonomously from images in order to generate objective actionable feedback, enabling clinicians not trained as wound specialists to deliver ""standardized wound care"". Digital objectivity contrasts with the current practice of subjective, visual inspection of wounds based on physician experience. The first aim will develop image processing algorithms to mitigate wound analysis errors caused by non-ideal lighting in some clinical or home settings, and when the wound is photographed from arbitrary camera angles and distance. While our previous wound system worked well in ideal conditions, non-ideal lighting caused large errors and healthy skin was detected as the wound area in extreme cases. The second aim extends our existing wound analysis system that targets only diabetic wounds to handle arterial, venous and pressure ulcers, expanding the potential user. The third aim will synthesize algorithms that autonomously generate actionable wound decision rules that are learned from decisions taken by actual wound clinicians.

"Closed-Loop Stimulus Optimization to Increase Communication Efficiency in Brain-Computer Interfaces ABSTRACT This administrative supplement is in response to the Notice of Special Interest to improve the artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML)-Readiness of NIH-supported sata (NOT-OD-21-094). Summary of Parent Award. Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems are used by people with communication and motor disabilities, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), to communicate and interact with their environment. There are conventional AAC devices that are controlled by access methods such as touch, switch, head tracking and eye gaze; however, these access methods become difficult or impossible to use when sustained muscle control or voluntary motor control is lost. There are brain-computer interface (BCI) communication systems, such as the P300 speller, that use sensory stimulation to elicit and then detect sensory neural responses in electroencephalography (EEG) data. However, communication with stimulus driven BCIs is suboptimal due to relying on inherently noisy EEG data and highly variable neural responses for BCI control. BCI communication rates can potentially be improved by leveraging information in EEG data in real-time to optimally tune the BCI system’s parameters to maximise BCI performance under conditions of uncertainty. This work investigates a novel closed-loop stimulus selection algorithm that optimises the stimulus presentation schedule of the P300 speller in real-time based on the measured EEG data and the BCI system’s belief about the user’s intent. Aim 1 develops and tests the novel algorithm in a cohort of abled- bodied individuals to evaluate the real-time feasibility and utility of closed-loop stimulus selection. Aim 2 will test the closed-loop stimulus selection algorithm in a cohort of individuals with ALS to assess the performance of the algorithm in target BCI end users. Goals of this Supplement. There is a current unmet need for large, diverse BCI datasets that include target BCI end users for BCI algorithm development, particularly with the popularity of data hungry deep learning models. Based on NIH-supported research for 10+ years, we have acquired a large amount of single- and multi-session data from P300 speller studies with abled-bodied participants and participants with ALS using different stimulus presentation paradigms. Guided by FAIR principles, in this supplement: (1) we will perform data curation, data cleaning and data engineering to develop a cross-platform readable P300 speller dataset with common data and metadata elements and make this dataset publicly available; and we will demonstrate the usability of this dataset in (2) an AI/ML application focused on developing robust data representations to mitigate the negative effect of variabilities in EEG data on AI/ML algorithms; and (3) in student research programs focused on skill development in data science and AI/ML. A large, inclusive and accessible BCI dataset will have significant impact in the BCI community and the broader AI/ML community, as it will support research to develop and compare novel data representations, stimulus paradigms and neural signal decoding algorithms towards establishing BCIs as viable AAC devices. PROJECT NARRATIVE People with significant motor disabilities often require assistive devices such as augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems to communicate and interact with their environment. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can provide access to AAC systems and other devices for individuals with little to no voluntary muscle control in order to facilitate their communication with the outside world; however current BCI communication accuracies and speeds are suboptimal. The goal of this research effort is to develop and test the use of closed- loop optimisation techniques in BCI system design, where information from previous user responses and actions by the system is considered during the selection of the next action of the system. These closed loop techniques will be used to optimise BCI stimulus presentation parameters during real-time use to improve BCI communication efficiency, and demonstrated success of the proposed closed-loop stimulus optimisation method in real-time BCI use has the potential to accelerate the translation of BCI systems into viable AAC devices.",Closed-Loop Stimulus Optimization to Increase Communication Efficiency in Brain-Computer Interfaces,10412578,R21DC018347,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ', ' Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Motor Neuron Disease ', "" Gehrig's Disease "", ' Lou Gehrig Disease ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Learning ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Noise ', ' Parents ', ' Psychophysics ', ' psychophysical ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Self-Help Devices ', ' Assistive Technology ', ' assisted device ', ' assistive device ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Students ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' User-Computer Interface ', ' human computer interface ', ' human machine interface ', ' man machine interface ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Schedule ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Refractory ', ' Pythons ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Data Files ', ' Measurement ', ' Skeletal Muscle ', ' Voluntary Muscle ', ' Funding ', ' Letters ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Sensory ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' spelling ', ' interest ', ' gaze ', ' directs attention ', ' directed attention ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Speed ', ' skills ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' axon signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neurotransmission ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' graduate student ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' Touch ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch sensation ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Readability ', ' response ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Documentation ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' AAC Device ', ' AAC Intervention ', ' Augmentative and Alternative Communication ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Belief System ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' Output ', ' time use ', ' Information Technology ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' brain computer interface ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' skill acquisition ', ' skill development ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' file format ', ' open source ', ' usability ', ' brain research ', ' motor control ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergrad ', ' undergraduate ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' student participation ', ' student engagement ', ' student motivation ', ' learning community ', ' Data Science ', ' Data Engineering ', ' Learning Skill ', ' communication device ', ' FAIR principles ', ' FAIR data ', ' FAIR guiding principles ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable ', ' deep learning ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' data cleaning ', ' data cleansing ', ' algorithm development ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' data curation ', ' data standards ', ' data standardization ', ' data repository ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' ']",NIDCD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,266638,NC-04
"Improving AI/ML-readiness of FaceBase Research Datasets PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of the FaceBase III Hub was created by the National Institute for Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) to create a data repository to serve the entire community of dental and craniofacial researchers by sharing diverse data related to craniofacial development and dysmorphia, as well as other research communities that can leverage the diverse data that is in the FaceBase repository. One particularly unique and important element of FaceBase III is that it has over 22,000 facial images from over 11,000 human subjects, many of which are labeled with syndromes based on clinical and genomic diagnoses. Facial images are a critical resource for studying the correlation between genotype and phenotype and have received intense interest within the Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) research field with notable advances in automated phenotyping. While FaceBase embraces the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles, there are unique concerns specific to AI/ML research including: presence of noise, uncertainty of labels, and bias within datasets. It is imperative that we remedy any limitations in the utility of FaceBase’s facial imaging data for AI/ML research. In this project, we propose to unlock the tremendous potential of FaceBase facial scans by identifying gaps in how data is characterized, formated, and preprocessed from the perspective of its use in AI/ML research and algorithm development. To accomplish this, we propose to initiate a pilot application that applies existing deep learning algorithms developed by investigators in this proposal to existing FaseBase data (Aim 1). The goal of the pilot is to identify how curation, organization and preparation of FaceBase data might be improved so as to streamline their use in ML/AI based investigations. Based on what we learn from the pilot, we will modify the current FaceBase self curation processes specifically around Facial Scans (Aim 2). This will require us to streamline our process associated with curation of human subject data, so that we have the necessary rich descriptive elements while maintaining required restrictions on data handling. Ultimately, the goal is to position the FaceBase Hub so that the existing facial scan resources become more broadly useful to AI/ML researchers. More significantly, we expect to see an increased availability with facial scan data and other associated data types, such as genotyping and neurofunctional data. By making the proposed improvements to our data ingest procedures, we anticipate that this proposal will allow FaceBase to scale to significantly larger data set sizes, and consequently, cementing and expanding its position as a unique resource to the broader NIH community of ML and AI researchers. PROJECT NARRATIVE Craniofacial dysmorphia is one of the leading causes of birth defects, and in recognition, the major goal of the FaceBase III project is to advance research by creating comprehensive datasets of craniofacial development and dysmorphologies and to disseminate these datasets to the wider research NIH research community. FaceBase currently contains many unique data sets that could be leveraged by machine learning and deep learning algorithms. A prime example of this is the extensive collection of 3D facial scans. Facial images are a critical resource for studying the correlation between genotype and phenotype and have received intense interest within the Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) research field with notable advances in automated phenotyping. Current FaceBase data collections have not been curated with AI/ML as one of the target use cases. In this proposal, we will use a simple DL pilot to assess gaps in the FaceBase data curation practices and propose solutions to those caps so as to enhance the use of FaceBase data for emerging research based on AI/ML. .",Improving AI/ML-readiness of FaceBase Research Datasets,10412668,U01DE028729,"['Congenital Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Malformation ', ' Congenital adrenal hyperplasia ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biology ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communities ', ' Correlation Studies ', ' Statistical Correlation ', ' Joint structure of suture of skull ', ' Cranial Sutures ', ' Craniosynostosis ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Elements ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Future ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Learning ', ' Motivation ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Natural regeneration ', ' Regeneration ', ' regenerate ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' cranium ', ' Skull ', ' Surgical sutures ', ' Sutures ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Yang ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Intracranial Hypertension ', ' Elevated Intracranial Pressure ', ' Intracranial Pressure Elevation ', ' Intracranial Pressure Increase ', ' raised ICP ', ' raised intracranial pressure ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Calvaria ', ' calvarial ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Dental ', ' insight ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Facies ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' craniofacial anomalies ', ' craniofacial defects ', ' craniofacial malformation ', ' Craniofacial Abnormalities ', ' catalog ', ' Catalogs ', ' Principal Component Analyses ', ' Principal Component Analysis ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Intellectual disability ', ' Intellectual limitation ', ' intellectual and developmental disability ', ' Intellectual functioning disability ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' interest ', ' craniofacies ', ' craniofacial ', ' experience ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Dysmorphology ', ' Modeling ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Genomics ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Data ', ' NIDCR ', ' NIDR ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' Collection ', ' Validation ', ' Preparation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' rapid growth ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Neurocognitive Deficit ', ' IQ Deficit ', ' intelligence quotient deficit ', ' neurocognitive decline ', ' neurocognitive impairment ', ' malformation ', ' human disease ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' prototype ', ' Secure ', ' FaceBase ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' craniofacial development ', ' data hub ', ' sharing hub ', ' FAIR principles ', ' FAIR data ', ' FAIR guiding principles ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable ', ' human model ', ' model of human ', ' data submission ', ' data deposition ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' neural network architecture ', ' neural net architecture ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' rare genetic disorder ', ' rare genetic disease ', ' data cleaning ', ' data cleansing ', ' algorithm development ', ' data ingestion ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' diverse data ', ' data diversity ', ' data curation ', ' data repository ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' data handling ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,U01,2021,337557,CA-37
"Resolving and understanding the genomic basis of heterogeneous complex traits and diseases Parent grant Resolving and understanding the genomic basis of heterogeneous complex traits and diseases. Hundreds of genomics studies have exposed major gaps in our understanding of the mechanistic relationships between genomic variation, cellular processes, tissue function, and trait variation. The goal of the parent project is to develop a suite of computational frameworks that integrate massive collections of genomic and biomedical data to make the following three advances: Direction 1: Discern and leverage mechanism-based subtypes of complex traits and diseases. Direction 2: Characterize physiology and disease along the human lifespan and across the sexes. Direction 3: Find analogous contexts in model organisms for studying human traits/diseases. As demonstrated by us and others, genome-wide molecular networks are grand unifiers of molecular data and knowledge, and serve as powerful tools to contextually understand the roles genes play in cellular pathways, tissue physiology, phenotype/disease mechanisms, and drug action. Hence, a central aspect of our parent project is to develop multiple machine learning approaches to leverage molecular networks to generate accurate, testable hypotheses about the roles genes play in defining subtypes, age/sex differences, and cross-species analogs of a range of complex disorders.  As part of this work, we have developed GenePlexus github.com/krishnanlab/GenePlexus, an open source software to run and benchmark our state-of-the-art approach for combining genome-scale networks with supervised machine learning (ML) to get accurate novel predictions about various gene attributes (e.g., pathway membership or disease association; Liu*, Mancuso*, et al., 2020 Bioinformatics). Similarly, our group has committed efforts to make all our other computational methods available to the broader biomedical research community in the form of software tools for open science. We have released such software with nearly all our papers. Other recent examples include: ● PecanPy github.com/krishnanlab/PecanPy for parallelized, efficient, and accelerated node2vec. ● Expresto github.com/krishnanlab/Expresto for imputing unmeasured genes in transcriptomes. ● Txt2Onto github.com/krishnanlab/Txt2Onto for annotating –omics samples based on free-text metadata. Goal of the supplement project and current prototype GenePlexus: A cloud platform for network-based machine learning The goal of the proposed supplement is to take our software development to the next level by a building a new cloud-based GenePlexus platform to enable: i) biomedical/experimental researchers to seamlessly take advantage of network-based ML to generate interpretable genome-wide predictions, and ii) computational researchers to run network-based ML, retrieve results, and integrate with existing data analysis workflows. The project team, which includes the PI, a postdoc trained in cloud computing, and two professional software engineers – has worked together over the past six months to develop a prototype of the GenePlexus platform (in the form of a web-server mounted on Microsoft Azure; Fig. 1). Figure 1: Screenshots of the current prototype of the GenePlexus webserver that implements our original GenePlexus software github.com/krishnanlab/GenePlexus. When a user uploads a geneset, GenePlexus creates a virtual machine that trains a ML model, leveraging pre-saved data. In addition to predicting genes in the network functionally similar to the user-supplied genes, GenePlexus provides enables the user to interpret the custom-built ML model in terms of its similarity to thousands of models that were trained to predict genes associated with biological processes (from Gene Ontology) and diseases (from DisGeNET). In addition to retrieving the prediction results in multiple convenient formats, users can visualize the top predicted genes as a network graph. Narrative We are proposing to bring together two powerful approaches in biomedical data science – genome-scale network analysis and supervised machine learning (ML) – in the form of a cloud platform called GenePlexus. This platform will enable both biologists and bioinformaticians to easily perform network-based ML on massive genome-scale molecular networks and get novel interpretable predictions about gene attributes of interest. This work represents a significant step towards making AI more accessible to all researchers and labs and will help us and the community learn general design principles and best practices for running, storing, retrieving, and sharing ML models and results.",Resolving and understanding the genomic basis of heterogeneous complex traits and diseases,10406616,R35GM128765,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Information Networks ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Memory ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Paper ', ' Physiology ', ' Play ', ' Processed Genes ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Engineering ', ' Computer Software Development ', ' Computer Software Engineering ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Privacy ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Training ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Data Storage and Retrieval ', ' data retrieval ', ' data storage ', ' analog ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' interest ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' trait ', ' high-end computing ', ' High Performance Computing ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' drug action ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Genomics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Address ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Ontology ', ' Security ', ' Molecular ', ' sex ', ' Text ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' disease phenotype ', ' cost ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' molecular scale ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' data structure ', ' open source ', ' Network-based ', ' prototype ', ' parent grant ', ' parent project ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' cloud computer ', ' cloud based ', ' genomic variation ', ' learning community ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' open data ', ' open science ', ' open-source data ', ' cloud platform ', ' cloud server ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' web server ', ' computational suite ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Differences between sexes ', ' Differs between sexes ', ' Sexual differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' biomedical data science ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' virtual machine ', ' ']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,234750,MI-08
"Software development for Stan to improve survey statistics for non-probability samples 1 Project Summary This proposal is a supplement to our NIH grant R01 AG067149-01: Improving Representativeness in Non-probability Surveys and Causal Inference with Regularized Regression and Poststrati cation. That project involves developing certain Bayesian methods for sampling adjustment in a general,  exible, and reliable way that can be used for a wide range of problems in public health research. The project requires extensive use of the Stan probabilistic programming platform, both as part of the research e ort and as part of resulting methods.  This NOSI is synergistic with that grant. It will support new software engineering initiatives to improve the core Stan platform in three ways: (1) Providing the option for JSON format outputs will improve interoperability and facilitate incorporating Bayesian methods into machine learning pipelines; (2) Extending and refactoring the core Stan inference algorithms for greater memory eciency and increased parallel processing will improve the overall speed and scalability of infer- ence, allowing for Bayesian methods to be used with increasingly complex models. This will allow researchers to compare a greater number and wider range of models in order to nd those with optimal behaviors. (3) The addition of a standard logging framework will bene t both the Stan user community and the developer community.  The parent grant's research agenda is threefold. Firstly, it is directed to addressing the unique challenges posed by public health datasets and questions by investigating adaptations to state-of- the art modelling techniques. Secondly, it strives to improve causal inferences for demographic subgroups. Thirdly, and more broadly, it seeks to improve current methodology by developing work ows to test and validate models with non-representative data in order to obtain better and more trustworthy population based estimates.  The work in the NOSI is relevant in two ways. First, it will directly support the research in the main project. During our research, computational challenges arise. The progress in research reveals areas where the computational infrastructure needs to be improved; thus, the NOSI will enable us to do our NIH-funded research more e ectively. Second, it's important for the results of our research to be used by others. The computing work in the NOSI will make it easier for applied practitioners to make use of the research we have been developing. Furthermore, the addition of a common data format for inputs and outputs, greater processing speed and eciency, and standardized logging will make it easier to use Stan in complex processing pipelines, therefore improving overall cloud-readiness. Project Narrative The computational developments in this supplement will enable more effective fitting of statistical models for adjusting data from non-probability surveys to be representative of populations of interest. Being able to fit these models more reliably will enable more efficient and reliable survey research for the purpose of estimating population characteristics and average causal effects in a wide range of problems in public health, with examples including longitudinal surveys of health and wellbeing, surveys of hard-- to-reach populations, and effects of experimental interventions.

"The development and validation of a novel tool for the assessment of bulbar dysfunction in ALS Project Summary  The overall aim of our “parent” grant proposal is to develop and validate a clinician-administered bulbar dysfunction assessment tool for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), called ALS-Index of Bulbar Dysfunction (ALS-IBD). Interrupted by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, clinical practices as well as clinical research have been forced to pivot, simultaneously providing an unprecedented opportunity for the development of new and expansion of existing remote assessment platforms, which can serve clinical and research assessment needs. As part of this pivoting effort, we recently created VirtualSLP, a software tool to support remote, online multi- modal - high quality video/kinematic and audio/acoustic – data collection, using a multi-platform compatible, web-browser based audio and video recordings. In parallel, we have designed a tool for automatic extraction of kinematic and acoustic metrics of neurological diseases, which provides clinically interpretable features/ measures that have been identified as important for detecting and tracking the onset and progression of oro- motor and speech (aka bulbar) impairments in neurological diseases. The next step in the progression of our technology development efforts is to incorporate the automatic metrics extraction software within VirtualSLP, creating a user-friendly and intuitive cloud-based platform for research and clinical assessment of bulbar dysfunction. To achieve rapid development and deployment of VirtualSLP, we will use modern engineering methodology and user-centered design to iterate through a number of steps in the software development cycle. The cycle will begin with the engagement of end users (e.g., researchers, clinicians and patients) in design sessions to document users' current and anticipated end-to-end experiences with the software, while performing the baseline analysis of the existing software components and determining and implementing necessary changes. The necessary components will be incorporated to create VirtualSLP on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform, to enhance its usability, interoperability, scalability, and security, as part of the NIH STRIDES initiative. Usability testing of Virtual SLP with end users will be performed throughout the development process and at the end of the development cycle. When completed, the work will result in an enhanced software tool for collection of audio and video data and corresponding AI-based analytics to be used in the context of clinical research. VirtualSLP will propel our specific work on developing a clinician- administered tool for bulbar ALS assessment and monitoring (ALS-IBD-Remote) by providing a novel cloud- based platform for its clinical validation. This work aims to exemplify the intent of the current funding opportunity by supporting collaborations between clinical speech scientists, data scientists, and software engineers to enhance the design, implementation, and ""cloud-readiness"" of research software. Project Narrative  The current proposal focuses on the development of VirtualSLP, a software tool for video and audio data collection and automatic AI-based analytics to be used in the context of clinical research. VirtualSLP will propel our specific work on developing a clinician-administered tool for the assessment and monitoring of bulbar ALS, as well as other neurological diseases, by providing a novel cloud-based platform for validation of remote assessment.

"Domain-Knowledge Informed Deep Learning for Early Detection of Pancreatic Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of this project is to leverage deep-learning algorithms on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve early detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a malignancy with high mortality and morbidity. Although numerous risk factors have been identified, PDAC is most often found in later stages when effective treatments are not feasible or their survival benefit is limited. In this R21, we aim to develop novel structured methodologies for systematically incorporating feature grouping strategy from expert domain knowledge into the training procedure of deep-learning algorithms for improving PDAC diagnosis. The overarching hypothesis for this study is that the groups of highly correlated variables will combine to form superior and interpretable predictors compared to individual clinical variables (current proposal). Furthermore, these new predictors represented by the group of related data will be useful for other downstream tasks such as risk factor identification via causal discovery (future research). The proposed research presents an innovative approach towards unifying human and artificial intelligence, using explainable algorithms to build interpretable prediction models, in contrast to conventional deep-learning algorithms which are non-traceable by humans due to their black-box nature. An optimal strategy for creating composite (grouped) variables should maximize both predictive power as well as human-interpretability. We will thus explore a variety of grouping strategies relying heavily on human-expert knowledge (e.g. clinical workflows) as well as auto-correlation tests. An effective grouping strategy will allow our prediction model to learn the relative importance of both individual measurements as well as interpretable groups of measurements in predicting PDAC. Examples in the literature show that such grouped predictors often have superior predictive power compared to their individual components, which can be attributed to the mutual information shared within the group. Different types of explainable (attention) neural networks may also be applied depending on the group characteristics to further improve interpretability as well as prediction accuracy. We believe that similar methodologies applied to predictive modeling in healthcare data have the potential to fundamentally advance clinical decision making with improved model interpretability. The success of this proposal will be leveraged in a larger ongoing project which aims to establish new causal relationships between various risk factors associated with PDAC. This involves an advanced graph-based approach for building interpretable models. Our direct application of causal discoveries in the future research will be a program for collecting patient-generated health data (PGHD) for PDAC early diagnosis. The goal of this proposal is to develop new protocols for the early detection of pancreatic cancer using a novel strategy for combining human-expert knowledge with deep-neural embeddings. Our study involves a structured exploration of feature grouping strategies using Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to develop predictive and potentially insightful deep learning models. We will be able to propose new predictors represented by groups of related data that are expected to have superior predictive ability for improving pancreatic cancer diagnosis.",Domain-Knowledge Informed Deep Learning for Early Detection of Pancreatic Cancer,10317236,R21CA265400,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Attention ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Chronology ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mining ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Savings ', ' Signs and Symptoms ', ' Diagnostic Findings ', ' Statistical Study ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' data quality ', ' Measurement ', ' Malignant Pancreatic Neoplasm ', ' Pancreas Cancer ', ' Pancreatic Cancer ', ' pancreatic malignancy ', ' Malignant neoplasm of pancreas ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' Visit ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' success ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' Categories ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Provider ', ' Pancreas Ductal Adenocarcinoma ', ' Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Scheme ', ' Characteristics ', ' Grouping ', ' groupings ', ' Text ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' direct application ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' demographics ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' electronic structure ', ' data format ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' screening ', ' health data ', ' Data Analytics ', ' associated symptom ', ' co-morbid symptom ', ' co-occuring symptom ', ' comorbid symptom ', ' concurrent symptom ', ' cooccuring symptom ', ' symptom association ', ' symptom comorbidity ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' multimodal data ', ' multi-modal data ', ' multi-modal datasets ', ' multimodal datasets ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' feature extraction ', ' pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma model ', ' PDA model ', ' PDAC Model ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2021,176874,NY-13
"Development of Nanomembrane Electronics and Machine-Learning Algorithms for Quantitative Screening of Dysphagia Therapeutics Project Summary Dysphagia is an impairment of the swallow reflex's neurological and muscular functions that causes a debilitating and potentially deadly condition such as choking, malnutrition, dehydration or pneumonia during swallowing. Dysphagia afflicts almost 15 million Americans, particularly individuals 50-60 years or older with up to a 20% chance of dysphagia. However, regardless of the cause of dysphagia, currently there are no available therapeutic treatments. Limitation of preclinical tools and methods to study dysphagia is one of the biggest reasons for the lack of therapeutic treatment for dysphagia. Video-fluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) has been used to diagnose dysphagia in a clinical study as well as research with animal models for drug development. However, the VFSS method in clinical study relies on the active cooperation of a human subject, such as ingestion of food with barium (oral contrast agent) and movement immobilization during X-ray imaging. The VFSS tool shows the severe issue in an animal study due to uncontrollable target, which results in poor image quality and unreliable drug development. Overall, none of the existing commercial systems can offer a portable, real-time, continuous monitoring of swallowing with either humans or animals. Here, this project will develop a novel, nanomembrane electronic system that offers a continuous, quantitative assessment of swallowing activities in a non-invasive way on the skin of rat models, which will help to develop potential dysphagia drugs. Specifically, we will develop soft, ultrathin, lightweight, miniaturized wearable electronics to monitor time-dependent changes of swallowing muscle functions via wireless, real-time recording of electromyograms on swallowing muscles of a dysphagia rat model. In this project, our initial study in the evaluation of dysphagia therapeutics will focus on ALS-related dysphagia since there are well-established animal models (transgenic superoxide dismutase; SODG93A) with severe dysphagia at a young age. SODG93A animal models have been widely used to screen potential therapeutic compounds, including two FDA-approved ALS drugs: edaravone and riluzole. Collectively, if successful, the newly developed nanomembrane electronics will be a game-changer in the therapeutic evaluation of candidate drugs for ALS-related dysphagia as well as other diseases- related dysphagia. The research outcome is expected to provide a new drug for an effective treatment of dysphagia, which will eventually reduce mortality and improve the quality of life of dysphagia patients. Project Narrative Dysphagia afflicts almost 15 million Americans, particularly individuals 50-60 years or older with up to a 20% chance of dysphagia. However, there is no available therapeutic treatment for dysphagia.

"Map Manager: Longitudinal image analysis with online editing and sharing. The increasing availability and ease of use of confocal, two-photon, and light-sheet microscopes coupled with rapid developments in fluorescent protein reporters have made 3D and functional imaging and its analysis a central component of modern Neuroscience research. Yet, the ease of acquiring 3D and functional images is creating progressively larger datasets, prompting the need for high-throughput image analysis algorithms and software that can be both rapid and accurate. Although software to analyze single time-point images has received substantial attention, tools to analyze multiple time-point longitudinal imaging datasets is currently lacking. This lack of longitudinal image analysis tools is a major barrier to scientific inquiry with individual labs devising their own analysis strategies creating a situation where it is difficult for others to verify and reproduce this analysis. What is needed is a community agreed upon longitudinal image analysis standard that promotes sharing.  Here, we propose to develop software to create and curate annotations in longitudinal imaging datasets. This software will solve a major problem by providing the needed rigor and reproducibility while making it easy for researchers to distribute their data and analysis. Making these important datasets findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. To achieve these goals, we propose to build intuitive web-browser and desktop graphical-user-interfaces (GUIs) that will work with cloud based data and analysis. These GUIs will be driven by a Python advanced-programming-interface (API) that is scriptable. For online editing and sharing we will work with the BRAIN funded Brain Image Library (BIL), and for interoperability with Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) and Neuroscience Data Interface. We will utilize the BRAIN Initiative NeuroMorpho.Org and Defining Our Research Methodology (DORY), to ensure our annotations of morphology, connectivity, and physiological signatures include accepted meta-data nomenclatures and vocabularies.  We will work closely with a group of ""seed"" BRAIN funded labs to obtain feedback and make rapid improvements in the functionality and usability of the front-end GUIs and the back-end API. This will be achieved by online forums, site visits, and a hack-a-thon hosted at UC Davis. During the Covid pandemic we have learned that these events work extremely well when done virtually and are prepared to continue this model. We are committed to providing thorough documentation for the web-browser, desktop GUIs, and Python API as well as constantly refined and simple to follow recipes with interactive web-based use cases. To ensure community adoption and use, this proposal also includes working with a number of ""seed"" labs to run their data through the entire pipeline from analysis to online sharing.  The long range goal is to have Map Manager act as a catalyst for data analysis, exploration, and sharing. Effectively creating a community based approach, akin to other disciplines such as astronomy, where data is widely and publicly shared allowing effective data mining and model building to advance new discoveries. A major bottleneck in the interpretation of longitudinal imaging data is the availability of useful analysis software tools. The purpose of this proposal is to develop a rigorous and easy to use software ecosystem for the annotation, curation, and sharing of longitudinal imaging datasets. We will provide cloud-based editors and viewers that allow collaboration and dissemination of this critical data.",Map Manager: Longitudinal image analysis with online editing and

"Modeling the Coupled Dynamics of COVID-19 Transmission and Protective Behaviors Project Summary/Abstract A growing number of COVID-19 transmission models have been developed to help forecast the on-going epi- demic and compare outcomes of different non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in terms of cases, deaths, and medical supply needs. Most of these models do not include adaptive behavioral effects describing how risk perceptions and fatigue inﬂuence engagement with social distancing and transmission reduction. Decisions on mask-wearing, levels of social contact, and vaccination will deﬁne whether the epidemic is controlled or enters annual circulation. We propose the development of population-based (PBM) and agent-based (ABM) transmis- sion models to study the interplay between individual behavior and transmission dynamics, while considering the many uncertainties which still surround the virus, such as seasonal effects and the loss of immunity. Addition- ally, our models will be used to study how COVID-19 and seasonal inﬂuenza and respective behaviors interact, exacerbate outcomes, and potentially overwhelm the health care system. These models will build upon our prior research. Since Fall 2016 we have conducted regular longitudinal surveys investigating attitudes towards, risk perceptions of, and propensity to vaccinate for seasonal inﬂuenza. The ABM models constructed from these data account for adaption and memory of past experiences, peer effects, and population heterogeneity. Using machine learning methods, we have augmented a synthetic network representative of a small US city with this behavioral data. We have continued to conduct modiﬁed versions of these surveys to track how these beliefs translate to COVID-19. In parallel, we have developed a compartmental population-based model of COVID-19, which models transmission and the effects of NPI intensity and timing on both health and economic outcomes. We propose to extend our current compartmental PBM and build a new individual-level ABM, informed by longitudinal surveys. We will conduct a four-year longitudinal panel survey to construct an empirical behavioral model for decisions to socially distance, engage in transmission reduction measures (such as mask-wearing), and vaccinate. This information will be combined with our existing synthetic network data-set to enable us to build an individual level ABM of the spread of COVID-19 in a representative US city, integrated with our inﬂuenza ABM. This model will capture both how individual behaviors impact macro-level disease transmission and how inﬂuenza and COVID-19 could interact. Insights and data from our individual-level model will be used to inform and parameterize adaptive behavior within our compartment-level model, allowing for policy comparisons across a range of US states. In addition, we will consider which policies are robust to key behavioral and technological uncertainties, such as the extent of behavior change in response to perceived risk and the timing and effectiveness of vaccines. Finally, we will develop web-based interactive tools that allow for the exploration and comparison of different policies in a variety of potential futures. Project Narrative The trajectory of the COVID-19 epidemic is shaped by individual behavior. We propose the development of new transmission models of COVID-19 and seasonal inﬂuenza that study the interplay between individual behavior and transmission dynamics, while considering important uncertainties, such as seasonal effects and the loss of immunity. Building on our prior work on vaccination behaviors for inﬂuenza and the transmission of COVID-19, these models will be informed by tailored longitudinal surveys, observed behavior, and case data from the ongoing pandemic, and we will develop tools that run our models and allow users to identify the effects of behavioral factors on policy effectiveness, evaluate the potential impact of vaccine availability, and identify strategies that are robust to a wide range of uncertainties.",Modeling the Coupled Dynamics of COVID-19 Transmission and Protective

"Virtual Resection to Treat Epilepsy More than 1/3 of the world’s 65 million people with epilepsy (~3.3 million in the U.S.) have seizures that cannot be controlled by medications. Surgery and implanted devices are options for many, but their success depends upon manually mapping epileptic networks, which is only possible for some patients, and poorly standardized. When surgical targets are identified, there is currently no rigorous way to select the best surgical approach. The overall aim of this proposal is to develop rigorous, standardized, quantitative methods to: (1) map epileptic networks from imaging and Stereo EEG (SEEG), (2) pick the best region for resection, ablation or neuromodulation for individual patients from their data and clinical hypotheses, and (3) to determine when focal intervention is unlikely to succeed. These methods would have tremendous positive impact on clinical care. Over the first four years of this grant we have made substantial progress towards these goals. Our deliverables include: (1) robust measures derived from intracranial EEG (IEEG) that predict outcome from epilepsy surgery; (2) personalized methods that localize epileptic networks and predict the impact of different interventions on seizure control; (3) tools that predict the path of seizure spread from combined MRI and iEEG; and (4) a track record of openly sharing our methods, data, results and code on our platform http: //ieeg.org. In the next phase, we propose innovative solutions to 3 fundamental challenges in epilepsy surgery required to translate our work into practice: (1) Guiding SEEG: We must adapt our methods to the sparser sampling and different philosophy of stereo EEG, which maps a network of connected brain regions and tests clinical hypotheses about where seizures initiate and propagate; (2) Assessing sampling bias and missing information: We will develop methods to determine if electrodes sample all key regions of the epileptic network, to ensure we do not falsely localize due to missing information; (3) Validating in a larger population across centers: In parallel to refining the above methods, we will validate and optimize our analyses in a large number of patients to ready this work for a prospective clinical trial. In a novel model, we have engaged a group of major surgical epilepsy centers to openly collaborate, standardize methods, aggregate data, and share all algorithms, computer code, data and results on http: //ieeg.org. Our central hypothesis is that standardized, quantitative methods to guide epilepsy surgery can improve patient outcomes, lower morbidity, reduce cost and enable uniform, higher quality care across centers. This work is significant because it merges state of the art network neuroscience, engineering, neurology and neurosurgery to make practical tools to improve and standardize patient care. This project leverages a thriving collaboration between experts in neurology, computational neuroscience, neurosurgery, neuroimaging and bioengineering at the University of Pennsylvania that has generated 58 publications related to this proposal. We now extend this collaboration to academic epilepsy centers across the United States and worldwide. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because developing new quantitative methods to target and test epilepsy surgery in computer models before doing these procedures in the operating room will improve patient outcomes and reduce surgery side effects and costs. In this research we are also working with 15 major epilepsy centers to standardize treatment. For these reasons the proposal is relevant to part of the NIH’s mission to foster fundamental, creative discoveries and innovative research strategies that will ultimately protect and improve human health for the United States’ 3.3 million people with epilepsy.",Virtual Resection to Treat Epilepsy,10355919,R56NS099348,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Archives ', ' Sampling Biases ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bio-engineered ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bioengineering ', ' Brain Mapping ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Aggregation ', ' Aggregated Data ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Engineering ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Tonic-Clonic Epilepsy ', ' Grand Mal Convulsions ', ' Grand Mal Epilepsy ', ' Grand Mal Seizure Disorder ', ' Major Epilepsy ', ' Major Motor Seizure Disorder ', ' Tonic Clonic Convulsions ', ' Tonic Clonic Seizure Disorder ', ' Tonic-Clonic Convulsion Disorder ', ' Tonic-Clonic Convulsion Syndrome ', ' Tonic-Clonic Seizure Syndrome ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' implantable device ', ' biomedical implant ', ' implant device ', ' indwelling device ', ' Information Theory ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurology ', ' Neurosciences ', ' neurosurgery ', ' Operating Rooms ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Philosophy ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Sampling Errors ', ' Seizures ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Caring ', ' computational neuroscience ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Ablation ', ' success ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Brain region ', ' Data ', ' Multi-center clinical trial ', ' Multi-site clinical trial ', ' Multicenter clinical trial ', ' Multisite clinical trial ', ' Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Validation ', ' Resected ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' cost ', ' computer code ', ' virtual ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Implant ', ' open source ', ' network models ', ' clinical care ', ' clinical practice ', ' individual patient ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive tools ', ' side effect ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' data standards ', ' data standardization ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R56,2021,551628,PA-03
"High Performance Text Mining for Translator We propose to build a knowledge provider that will seek out, integrate and provide AI-ready, BioLink-compatible models via high-performance text-mining of the biomedical literature. Problems with Translator’s current mining of the biomedical literature that we intend to solve include: (1) weaknesses in framework extensibility and benchmarking that make integrating and validating new text-mining approaches difficult; (2) problematic licensing of software, terminologies and other resources that do not adequately support FAIR (and TLC) best practices; (3) processing only PubMed titles and abstracts, not full text publications; (4) Translator’s use of older NLP technology with relatively poor performance; (5) lack of a mechanism for community feedback regarding errors and other problems; (6) lack of continuous updates to add knowledge from new publications; (7) output knowledge representation that is simplistic and vague, failing to reflect the richness of what is expressed in scientific documents. Plan for implementation: Our team has a long history of productive NLP research, successful open source software projects, effective benchmarking and broad community engagement. We will build on the results of NLM-funded work in information extraction, our gold-standard Colorado Richly Annotated Full Text (CRAFT) corpus, a recent BioNLP Open Shared Task (BioNLP-OST) that we organized, and recent advances in state-of-the-art NLP. For Segment 1, we will: (1) Demonstrate BioStacks, an extensible, cloud-based text-mining framework that produces knowledge graphs grounded in the Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBOs). This BioStacks demo will include a state-of-the-art OBO concept recognizer for multiple ontologies, a state-of-the-art semantic relationship prediction tool, and a state-of-the-art structural analysis tool. All generated assertions will have provenance metadata linking the assertion to a particular text span in a document specified by PMCID. (2) Demonstrate CRAFTST, a cloud-based text-mining evaluation system that evaluates the performance of text-mining systems against the CRAFT gold standard. (3) Demonstrate an adaptive machine learning process illustrating how to efficiently create tools to extract BioLink association types. For Segment 2, we propose to extend the text-mining and evaluation frameworks to align with BioLink and the Translator community, improve text-mining quality and expand the collection of source documents mined. Specifically, we propose to target 10 long term milestones: (1) Align CRAFT to BioLink. (2) Develop new tools for extracting associations from text. (3) Develop and manage a community engagement process on text-mining for Translator. (4) Extend benchmarking. (5) Improve recall. (6) Improve precision. (7) Improve computational efficiency. (8) Expand BioStacks to include all available full text biomedical journal articles. (9) Expand document collections to include Patents & Regulatory filings. (10) Develop a scientist-based movement to improve document access for text-mining from non-open publishers. The types of questions the resulting knowledge graph can be used to address are extremely broad, as it is generated by mining a large part of the biomedical literature. Questions that can be answered include those about specific assertions (e.g. is this drug an agonist-activator of this protein?), general relations (are these two proteins often mentioned together?), and documents (which publications mention this gene, mutation and drug?). Integration: We are long-time contributors to the open-science community and have longstanding collaborations with existing awardees; we were participants in the NIH Data Commons Pilot. We propose to align the output of text-mining tools to the BioLink model via OBO terms. We propose to implement our frameworks in NIH Cloud Computing environments. We propose to adopt the CD2H Contributor Attribution Model to foreground community contributions. We plan to coordinate with the NLM’s nascent benchmarking activities and the SmartAPI effort to build Translator standard interfaces. Challenges and gaps: High-performance mining of rich, contextualized knowledge from the literature remains a difficult task, and is unlikely to be solved in the next five years. Many important publications remain inaccessible to text-mining due to restrictive licensing.

"Use of a Novel Toilet Seat to Passively Collect Digital Biomarkers in Assisted Living Settings ABSTRACT In senior living facilities, some of the most common health related problems stem from the GI tract and urinary system including Clostridium difficile Infections (CDI), Urinary Tract Infections (UTI), Constipation and Colon Cancer. The best way to lower costs and treat these conditions effectively is early diagnosis and treatment. Current clinical management for these conditions, as well as many others, include monitoring of specific excreta characteristics including urine color, urination frequency, urine duration, stool color, stool frequency and stool consistency. These logs are the best tool doctors currently have to screen for conditions such as UTIs, infectious diarrhea, dehydration, chronic kidney disease, GI bleeding, GU surgery, inflammatory bowel disease, and constipation, that can lead to hospitalizations and readmissions. However, these logs are on average 61% inaccurate at reporting adverse episodes such as diarrhea. Toi Labs has developed the patented TrueLoo technology to take pictures of excreta and, using machine learning algorithms, classify the toileting event using Digital Biomarkers (DBMs). The ability to create an excreta log to accurately deliver detailed information to doctors and healthcare providers can revolutionize healthcare by notifying when further screening (urine or fecal) is necessary. This novel, low-cost approach of machine learning and image identification technology that requires no change in behavior of the user will enable currently undetectable links between medical records and specific excreta patterns. In the future, the machine learning algorithm may be able to determine links between these excreta logs and the onset of specific diseases. In this study we will be collecting manual excreta records and automated TrueLoo digital excreta records in memory care and assisted living facilities, and compare them against each other and against patients’ deidentified medical records. We will determine correlative data between excreta logs and adverse events to establish conditional threshold for each type of adverse event and, using ML, try and establish individual conditional thresholds for reporting to caregiving staff. We will compare the manual and digital logs to assess the difference between speed of adverse episode identification when using TrueLoo as compared to manual logs. NARRATIVE (max 3 sentences) Assisted living facilities and memory care facilities have a high rate of health problems stemming from GI tract and urinary system issues including diarrhea, constipation, urinary tract infections, and colon cancer to name a few. The ability to create a digital bowel movement and urine log to accurately inform doctors and healthcare providers detailed and correct information can revolutionize healthcare by providing information on when further screening (urine or fecal) is necessary. Toi Labs has created TrueLoo, a specialized toilet seat, that captures images to log the bathroom session and is building a computer algorithm to determine links between toilet logs and the onset of diseases.",Use of a Novel Toilet Seat to Passively Collect Digital Biomarkers in Assisted Living Settings,10325655,R43AG074812,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Color ', ' Constipation ', ' Coprophagia ', ' Defecation ', ' bowel movement ', ' Dehydration ', ' body water dehydration ', ' Diarrhea ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Feces ', ' stool ', ' Fecal Impaction ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage ', ' GI bleeding ', ' GI hemorrhage ', ' gastrointestinal bleeding ', ' Gastrointestinal tract structure ', ' Alimentary Canal ', ' Digestive Tract ', ' GI Tract ', ' Gastrointestinal Tract ', ' alimentary tract ', ' digestive canal ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' care facilities ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Independent Living ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Disorder ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' longterm care ', ' male ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Early Signs: digital phenotyping to identify digital biomarkers for predicting burnout and cognitive functioning in ED clinicians Project Summary The Emergency Department (ED) is a central pillar of the health care system. ED physicians and nurses are exposed to high work-related stressors in addition to disruptive day-night shifts. The well- being of the 150,000 ED clinicians in the U.S. is important for public health with significant downstream effects on the well-being of the 145 million patients that are served every year. Of the 1 million U.S. physicians, 45% are reporting burnout symptoms and the number increases to 70% in ED physicians and up to 82% in ED nurses. Clinician burnout is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular diseases, mortality, medical errors, but also stress-mediated physiological alterations and cognitive decline. Yet, the knowledge about the long-term development of burnout is limited. To effectively intervene, the timely identification of ED clinicians at risk for burnout is a critical prerequisite. This study proposes an innovative approach using digital phenotyping to discover and test Digital Biomarkers as predictors of burnout symptoms and cognitive function.  This proposed prospective longitudinal study will chart cognitive functioning and burnout symptom trajectories in a cohort of 350 ED clinicians to inform when, where, and how to intervene. We will use advanced computational methods to extract objective markers for burnout and cognitive decline from video and audio data. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that voice and speech content, head movement, pupil dilation, gaze, and facial landmark features of emotion provide probabilistic information that will allow us to identify digital biomarkers for burnout and cognitive function.  We will test the relevance of the discovered digital biomarkers and determine their discriminatory accuracy to distinguish between risk for clinically relevant vs. non-relevant burnout symptoms. We examine the association of digital biomarkers with physiological markers of chronic stress (i.e., hair cortisol concentration). We will also assess the association of digital biomarkers with the long-term job-related stress load of individual ED clinicians such as high ED crowding, patient acuity level, ED staffing, sleep, and shift schedules. This research program aims to deliver an objective, accurate, and reliable digital measure for clinician well-being. Such digital biomarkers will enable more efficient ED clinician self-management and will promote low-threshold prevention strategies. The mental and physical well-being of ED clinicians is of high value to those who work day in and day out to save the lives of others and is the foundation of a well-functioning, high-quality emergency care system. Project Narrative Clinician burnout has reached endemic levels and is an established risk factor for cardiovascular disease, but knowledge gaps in assessing and understanding the longitudinal development of burnout hamper risk-based prevention and targeted interventions. We propose a novel digital phenotyping approach using deep learning based on a video-recorded interview about the experiences of emergency clinicans at work with the aim to identify objective digital biomarkers that predict burnout and cognitive functioning in emergency clinicians. We will determine how candidate digital biomarkers relate to physiological markers of chronic stress, and test the potential of digital biomarkers to self-manage burnout risk and promotes low-threshold burnout prevention.",Early Signs: digital phenotyping to identify digital biomarkers for predicting burnout and cognitive functioning in ED clinicians,10298751,R01HL156134,"['Affect ', '

"Outcome-Driven Approach to Minimize the Risks of Facial Distortion Following CMF Surgery Abstract:  Our main clinical motivation of this project is to provide personalized precision care to patients with jaw (both maxilla and mandible) deformities by significantly improving surgical planning method. The number of patients suffering from jaw deformities is escalating each year.  Orthognathic surgery is a main surgical procedure to treat jaw deformities by repositioning bony segments of the jaws. The ultimate outcomes of orthognathic surgery are judged by the final facial appearance. Although the facial soft tissues are not directly operated on, the face changes “automatically” following the bony changes. Orthognathic surgery requires extensive surgical planning. While we can accurately plan the bony movements and transfer it to the patient during the surgery using computer-aided surgical simulation (CASS) and 3D printing, surgeons are still unable to practically predict the facial changes during the surgical planning, and just hope that a postoperative normal face will be “automatically” restored. However, this “mental-clue” approach is not reliable because the facial change does not exactly follow bony change. The problem is even bigger in patients with composite defects. For example, if a patient has a skeletal deformity and mild facial defect, a surgeon must know, before surgery, how to overcorrect the skeleton to camouflage the soft-tissue defect. But this information can only be attained by accurate method to predict facial changes. In addition, from patient’s perspective, the final facial appearance is great concern to them. Therefore, it is extremely important, for both doctors and patients, to accurately predict facial changes.  In the previous project period, we have made significant achievements in predicting facial changes following bony movements using finite element (FE) method. However, this approach still requires a considerable amount of time to prepare FE models. In addition, rather than determining the ultimate surgical outcome (the postoperative facial appearance) first, the current method is still to predict the facial change passively following the bony surgery. These hurdles greatly prevent surgeons from practically using it in the clinical setting.  Our hypothesis is that a personalized precision treatment outcome can only be achieved if surgeons are able to determine the final treatment outcome, a desired postoperative face, before planning the bony surgery. To test our hypothesis, we propose to integrate outcome-driven and machine learning-based techniques together to first estimate a desired postoperative face, and then plan the bony surgery.  The proposed project will have a significant clinical impact on improving patient care quality. It will enable clinicians to develop an optimal surgical plan based on both facial and bony information, on-the-fly, using a single software in their routine clinical practice. It will also revolutionize the surgical planning technique using outcome- driven approach, i.e., to first estimate a desired postoperative face and then plan the bony surgery. Project Narrative: 1. In the US and throughout the world, the number of patients requiring orthognathic surgery for jaw  deformities, which involves skeleton, overlying soft tissue, or both, is escalating every ear. 2. Currently, while surgeons are able to accurately plan orthognathic surgery by virtually repositioning bony  segments to desired locations, they are still unable to practically predict the ultimate treatment outcomes  of orthognathic surgery, a desired postoperative facial appearance, during the surgical planning. 3. We are proposing to integrate outcome-driven and machine learning-based techniques together to first  estimate a desired postoperative face, and then plan the bony surgery, which will revolutionize the  surgical planning technique and enable clinicians to develop an optimal surgical plan based on both facial  and bony information, on-the-fly, using a single software in their routine clinical practice.",Outcome-Driven Approach to Minimize the Risks of Facial Distortion Following CMF Surgery,10225298,R01DE021863,"['Congenital Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Malformation ', ' Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' bone ', ' Ear ', ' Elements ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Jaw ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Lip structure ', ' Lip ', ' Mandible ', ' Inferior Maxillary Bone ', ' mandibular ', ' Maxilla ', ' maxillary ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Patients ', ' Planning Techniques ', ' Planning Methodology ', ' Planning Technic ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative ', ' Running ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Ensure ', ' soft tissue ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Progress Reports ', ' Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Deformity ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Slide ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Location ', ' skeletal ', ' reconstructive surgery ', ' Reconstructive Surgical Procedures ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Surgeon ', ' American ', ' success ', ' treatment planning ', ' Structure ', ' Reporting ', ' Appearance ', ' Skeleton ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Defect ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' orthognathic ', ' orthognathous ', ' craniomaxillofacial ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' computer aided ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Trauma ', ' clinical practice ', ' risk minimization ', ' 3D Print ', ' 3-D print ', ' 3-D printer ', ' 3D printer ', ' 3D printing ', ' three dimensional printing ', ' Precision therapeutics ', ' precision therapies ', ' precision treatment ', ' personalized care ', ' Precision care ', ' individualized care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' learning network ', ' virtual surgery ', ' Surgical Simulation ', ' virtual reality surgery ', ' surgery outcome ', ' surgical outcome ', ' ']",NIDCR,METHODIST HOSPITAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,616572,TX-09
"Optimizing Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention to Improve Dietary Adherence in Behavioral Obesity Treatment: A Micro-randomized Trial PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Behavioral obesity treatment produces clinically significant weight loss and reduced disease risk/severity for many individuals with overweight/obesity and cardiovascular disease. Yet, about half of patients fall short of expected outcomes, which can be largely attributed to lapses from the recommended diet. Our work has shown that dietary lapses (specific instances of nonadherence to dietary goals) are frequent during weight loss attempts (~3-4 times per week), associated with poorer weight losses, and triggered by momentary changing states (e.g., changes in mood or availability of palatable food). Thus, there is a clear need for innovative solutions that can provide dynamic in-the-moment interventions to improve adherence to the prescribed diet in obesity treatment. Our research team was the first to develop a smartphone-based just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) that includes: 1) daily ecological momentary assessment (EMA; repeated sampling via mobile device) of relevant behavioral, psychological, and environmental triggers for lapse; 2) a machine learning algorithm that uses information gathered via EMA to determine real-time lapse risk; & 3) delivery of brief intervention during high-risk moments. Our pilot work revealed that the JITAI was feasible, acceptable, and produced reductions in average lapse frequency. However, we have not yet shown a direct effect of the JITAI on eating behavior in the moment of heightened lapse risk and know little about the types of interventions that are most effective for reducing lapse. We therefore propose to extend our research via a micro- randomized trial (MRT), a methodology that involves random assignment to intervention (or control) at a specific decision point, i.e., when our algorithm predicts heightened risk for a lapse. The MRT will determine whether a specific intervention in a specific moment had its intended effect. We will therefore port our JITAI to a more scalable online platform and conduct a MRT to evaluate the effects of a generic lapse risk alert message and theory-driven just-in-time interventions on dietary lapses. After refinement testing with n=15 to ensure proper technical functioning of our updated JITAI, adults with overweight/obesity (n=159) will participate in a well-established 12-week online obesity treatment program + JITAI, with 12 weeks of JITAI-only follow-up. When an individual is at risk for lapsing s/he will be randomized to no intervention, a generic risk alert, or one of 4 theory-driven interventions with interactive skills training. The outcome of interest will be the occurrence (or lack thereof) of dietary lapse, as measured both subjectively (i.e., via EMA) and objectively (i.e., via wrist- based intake monitoring), in the hours following randomization. Results of the MRT will inform an optimized algorithm for intervention delivery that will drive the finalized JITAI. A future RCT will compare weight loss in obesity treatment with and without the optimized JITAI. This highly innovative approach will advance the science of adherence by supporting the development of sophisticated theoretical models of adherence behavior and informing JITAIs that target adherence to other health behaviors (e.g., medication, activity goals). PROJECT NARRATIVE This project targets dietary lapses (specific instances of nonadherence to dietary goals), a major cause of poor outcomes during behavioral obesity treatment, which is recommended as a first-line intervention for cardiovascular disease. We propose to conduct a micro-randomized trial to empirically optimize a just-in-time adaptive intervention that monitors risk and intervenes on lapses as needed. By evaluating the immediate, proximal effect of four theory-driven interventions on lapse behavior, the project will: (a) produce a scalable, finalized JITAI that has the greatest potential to show clear clinical impact in future RCTs and pragmatic trials; and (b) inform the development of more sophisticated theoretical models of adherence behavior more broadly.",Optimizing Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention to Improve Dietary Adherence in Behavioral Obesity Treatment: A Micro-randomized Trial,10223435,R01HL153543,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Body Weight Changes ', ' Weight Change ', ' Energy Intake ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Methodology ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Moods ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Patients ', ' Psychological Factors ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Suggestion ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' body weight loss ', ' wt-loss ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' diet intervention ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Location ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' interest ', ' skills training ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' treatment program ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Palate ', ' brief therapy ', ' brief treatment ', ' brief intervention ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' pilot trial ', ' obesity treatment ', ' obesity intervention ', ' obesity therapy ', ' Outcome ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' high risk ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' pragmatic effectiveness trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' patient engagement ', ' participant engagement ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' dietary adherence ', ' diet adherence ', ' behavioral adherence ', ' behavior adherence ', ' adaptive intervention ', ' dietary ', ' ']",NHLBI,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,R01,2021,607792,RI-01
"Multiscale models of fibrous interface mechanics PROJECT SUMMARY Interfaces between tissues either transfer load (requiring toughness) or provide a smooth surface (requiring low friction). Fibrous interfaces are very effective at transferring load between tissues, e.g., at connective tissue-bone interfaces (“entheses”), peritoneal-mesentery interfaces, interfaces between layers of the vasculature, and the pia mater. These interfaces require toughness to resist high stresses associated with material mismatches. Surgical repair can lead to smooth interfaces becoming fibrous, (e.g., following hernia surgery) or to tough interfaces becoming weak (e.g., following tendon- and ligament-to-bone repair). In older patients with large rotator cuff repairs, for example, where the desired attachment is not reformed, up to 94% of surgical repairs fail. These challenges arise in part because the features that endow fibrous interfaces with toughness are not known. We therefore propose to develop a comprehensive modeling and experimental approach for studying the factors underlying the transition from tough to weak in a fibrous interface. Our previous work motivates the hypothesis that disorder is a key toughening feature of fibrous attachments. We will focus initially on the example of tendon attaching to bone, in which microscale disorder underlies the ordered macroscale, graded transition between the two tissues, as a foundation for studying the general problem of adhesion throughout the body. We predict that disorder enhances energy absorption by distributing failure processes and energy absorption over larger volumes of tissue. We propose this as a fundamental mechanism by which fibrous interfaces in the body transfer load effectively. We will test these ideas through two aims: (1) Identify and model the mechanisms of fibrous attachment toughening ex vivo. We will model and experimentally validate how disorder across length scales toughens the tendon-to-bone attachment. Hierarchical molecular dynamics-to- continuum models, enriched by machine learning, will be validated in vitro, in systems with nanoscale control of mineral distributions, and ex vivo, in tissue samples of fibrous attachments. (2) Identify and model the loss of fibrous attachment toughness due to pathologic settings in vivo using murine rotator cuff tendinopathy models. In both aims, nano- through milli-scale characterization will be performed to define the mechanisms driving mechanical behavior. We will test the hypothesis that pathology- induced changes at multiple length scales will predict changes in failure mode. These models and experiments will test the global hypothesis that energy absorption across hierarchies is a fundamental toughening mechanism by which fibrous interfaces resist injury level loads. Taken together, we believe that these new models of fibrous attachment will enable an understanding of how the order and complexity of fibrous attachments leads to effective attachment of tissues. PROJECT NARRATIVE Tough fibrous interfaces between tissues are a common location of injury and source of pathology, pain and disability. Surgical repairs of interfaces that are desirable proceed in the absence of knowledge of the mechanisms that endow fibrous interfaces with toughness, and unsurprisingly have very high failure rates of up to a nearly unbelievable 94%. By developing and testing the first mathematical models for the toughness of this class of interfaces, we hope to identify the mechanisms of toughening definitively, and more broadly to provide technology that enables design of improved surgical procedures.",Multiscale models of fibrous interface mechanics,10222575,R01AR077793,"['absorption ', ' Adhesions ', ' Adhesives ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Behavior ', ' bone ', ' Bone Regeneration ', ' bone repair ', ' regenerate bone ', ' Botulinum Toxin Type A ', ' Botulinum A Toxin ', ' Botulinum Neurotoxin A ', ' Clostridium Botulinum Toxin Type A ', ' Clostridium botulinum A Toxin ', ' botulinum toxin A ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Collagen ', ' Collagen Diseases ', ' collagen disorder ', ' collagenopathy ', ' Connective Tissue ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Hernia ', ' In Vitro ', ' Laparotomy ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Ligaments ', ' Mesentery ', ' Mesenteric ', ' Minerals ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Pia Mater ', ' Running ', ' cranium ', ' Skull ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Tendon structure ', ' Tendons ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Rotator Cuff ', ' Friction ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' crosslink ', ' cross-link ', ' improved ', ' Surface ', ' repaired ', ' repair ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Meniscus structure of joint ', ' Meniscus ', ' Collagen Fiber ', ' Fiber ', ' disability ', ' Failure ', ' Nature ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Bone Tissue ', ' millimeter ', ' Peritoneal ', ' Slide ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Musculoskeletal ', ' Palsy ', ' Plegia ', ' paralysis ', ' paralytic ', ' Paralysed ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Molecular Dynamics Simulation ', ' molecular dynamics ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' Structure ', ' Modeling ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Skin ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Length ', ' Intra-abdominal ', ' in vivo ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' nano ', ' Tendinopathy ', ' Tendinitis ', ' Tendonitis ', ' multi-scale modeling ', ' multiscale modeling ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' nanoscale ', ' nano meter scale ', ' nano meter sized ', ' nano scale ', ' nanometer scale ', ' nanometer sized ', ' nanocrystal ', ' nano crystal ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' mechanical behavior ', ' treadmill ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' ']",NIAMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,474719,MO-01
"NBER Roybal Center for Behavior Change in Health SUMMARY/ABSTRACT NBER Roybal Center for Behavior Change in Health – Overall Health outcomes are affected by myriad mechanisms, including behaviors. An important question is how such behaviors might be influenced in ways that improve health outcomes on a broad population-wide scale. The NBER Roybal Center explores this question by conducting carefully-designed experimental interventions with analytic and theoretical foundations in the behavioral sciences. The interventions are selected to be cost- effective and scalable. Among the categories of health-related behavior we plan to study are interventions to improve nutrition; interventions to increase exercise; interventions to overcome addiction, including tobacco, alcohol, and opioids; interventions to promote preventive care, including vaccinations and incremental utilization of workplace wellness programs; interventions to improve medical adherence, including the filling of pharmaceutical prescriptions; and interventions to improve the decisions of health care providers, including applications of machine learning. The research plan is strengthened by a partnership with Geisinger Clinic, a non-profit health care network and insurer with a rich history of innovative delivery reforms and experimental research to improve population health in an active, well-integrated, health care delivery and community health setting. The NBER-Geisinger partnership provides a core infrastructure for implementing experimental interventions on-site with an engaged and committed health care delivery partner. The Center also engages a collaborative network of leading behavioral scientists from multiple disciplines who conduct the experimental interventions, share research activities and findings, collaborate on joint projects, and brainstorm new intervention opportunities, building from findings in basic science. This application renews the NBER Roybal Center for the next five years. PROJECT NARRATIVE – PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Health is a foundational source of wellbeing for people of all ages. As resilient as human physiology may be, and as random and unexpected as health events may be to any particular person at any particular time, health is also affected by the lifestyle decisions that we make, our behavioral interactions with the medical care system, and how we respond to adverse health events when they occur. The NBER Roybal Center for Behavior Change in Health will take research from basic science and translate it into applications that address real-world problems in ways that directly, broadly, and cost-effectively improve population health.",NBER Roybal Center for Behavior Change in Health,10221548,P30AG034532,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Choice Behavior ', ' Data Collection ', ' Decision Making ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health delivery systems ', ' health services delivery ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Economics ', ' Exercise ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Foundations ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Incentives ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Joints ', ' Leadership ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Persons ', ' nutrition ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Physiology ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Smoking ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Translating ', ' Vaccination ', ' Wellness Program ', ' Work ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Family member ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Workplace ', ' Job Location ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Site ', ' Work Location ', ' Work Place ', ' Work-Site ', ' Worksite ', ' work setting ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Medical ', ' Discipline ', ' Opioid ', ' Opiates ', ' Research Activity ', ' Onset of illness ', ' disease onset ', ' disorder onset ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' diet intervention ', ' Collaborations ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' behavior change ', ' meetings ', ' cohesion ', ' synergism ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Categories ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' community-based health ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' cost ', ' care systems ', ' care services ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Natural experiment ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' public health relevance ', ' population health ', ' career life balance ', ' work life balance ', ' laboratory experiment ', ' lab assignment ', ' lab experiment ', ' laboratory activity ', ' laboratory assignment ', ' laboratory exercise ', ' exercise intervention ', ' physical activity intervention ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative care ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' provider networks ', ' Infrastructure ', ' community engagement ', ' ']",NIA,NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH,P30,2021,531220,MA-05
"SCH: Leveraging Clinical Time Series to Learn Optimal Treatment of Acute Dyspnea  The ability to rapidly match the right patients to the right treatments at the right time is critical to ensuring patients  receive high quality care. The vast majority of machine learning applications in healthcare focus on diagnosing or  stratifying patients for a particular outcome. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn how clinical states  (i.e., sets of signs, symptoms, and test results) respond to specific sequences of treatments, with the goal of optimizing clinical outcomes. RL does not aim to diagnose, but infers diagnosis based on a patient's response to  specific treatments--in many ways mimicking how clinicians operate in practice. This proposal will develop a novel  clinician-in-the-loop reinforcement learning (RL) framework that analyzes electronic health record (EHR) clinical time-series data to support physician decision making, iteratively providing physicians the estimated outcome of  potential treatment strategies. Our topic of focus for this work is the evaluation and treatment of patients hospitalized with acute dyspnea (shortness of breath) and signs of impending respiratory failure. Acute dyspnea is an ideal condition for an RL approach, since it can be due to three overlapping conditions: congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia. Determining optimal treatment for these patients is clinically difficult, as a patient's presentation is frequently ambiguous, rapidly changing, and often due to multiple causes.  Inappropriate treatment may occur in up to a third of patients leading to increased mortality. While developing this  RL framework, we will also develop methods to learn more useful representations of high-dimensional clinical time-series data to improve the efficiency of RL model training. In addition, given the challenges of working with observational health data, we will develop new methods for evaluation of learned policies and develop new theory to better understand the limitations of RL using observational data. The project has four aims: 1) create a shareable, de-identified EHR time-series dataset of 35,000 patients with acute dyspnea, 2) develop techniques for exploiting invariances In tasks involving clinical time-series data to improve the efficiency of RL model training, 3) develop and evaluate an RL-based framework for learning optimal treatment policies for acute dyspnea, and 4) prospectively validate the learned treatment model. This research will result in new techniques for learning representations from time-series data and will study both the theoretical and practical limitations of RL using observational clinical data, leading to key advancements in ML and RL for clinical care. The tools developed for clinical decision support in this proposal have the potential for high impact because of their ability to generalize beyond the problem studied here to other conditions, laying the groundwork for clinical systems that directly impact society by aiding in the timely and appropriate treatment of patients. Hospitalization for sudden and severe shortness of breath (acute dyspnea) affects almost 2 million patients in the US each  year. Such patients can be difficult to treat, as their presentation may ambiguous, due to multiple causes that change over  time and require different types of therapies/treatments. In this proposal, we will develop novel reinforcement-learning  based approaches to quickly match patients to the best treatment based on his/her symptoms over time. The proposed  work could have a significant impact on health by shortening lhe time to appropriate treatments, leading to improved  patient outcomes.",SCH: Leveraging Clinical Time Series to Learn Optimal Treatment of Acute Dyspnea ,10221055,R01LM013325,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Dyspnea ', ' Breathlessness ', ' Engineering ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Congestive Heart Failure ', ' Cardiac Failure Congestive ', ' Heart Decompensation ', ' chronic heart failure ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Learning ', ' Linear Models ', ' Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease ', ' COPD ', ' Chronic Obstruction Pulmonary Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ', ' Methods ', ' Morality ', ' mortality ', ' Pathologic Processes ', ' Pathological Processes ', ' Patients ', ' Patient Rights ', ' Physicians ', ' Pneumonia ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rewards ', ' Right to Treatments ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signs and Symptoms ', ' Diagnostic Findings ', ' Societies ', ' Theoretical Studies ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' therapy selection ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Policies ', ' Sample Size ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Shortness of Breath ', ' Event ', ' Stream ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Test Result ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' transdisciplinary collaboration ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' theories ', ' Drops ', ' lung failure ', ' pulmonary failure ', ' Respiratory Failure ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' treatment strategy ', ' clinical practice ', ' network architecture ', ' health data ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' support tools ', ' patient stratification ', ' stratified patient ', ' high dimensionality ', ' clinical decision support ', ' patient response ', ' patient specific response ', ' responsive patient ', ' optimal treatments ', ' optimal therapies ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' Infrastructure ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' learning algorithm ', ' clinical database ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,232216,MI-12
"Clinical Informatics to Advance Epidemiology and Pharmacogenetics of Serious Cutaneous Adverse Drug Reactions Project Summary  Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) are morbid immunologic reactions to drugs that confer a mortality of 10-50%. Over the last decade, significant promise for prediction and prevention has come from the discovery that many SCARs are associated with variation within HLA class I alleles. For HLA-B*15:02, this has led to routine pre-prescription screening for carbamazepine in many Southeast Asian countries and a significant reduction in cases of carbamazepine SJS/TEN. Despite this progress, there is little known about genetic and epidemiological risk factors for SCARs related to commonly used drugs such as antibiotics. There is also limited information about HLA risk for SCARs across the diverse populations present in the United States. Furthermore, imprecision of clinical phenotyping and lack of standardized coding has led to challenges in finding SCAR cases in the electronic health record (EHR). Our proposed study aims to address critical challenges and gaps in our knowledge of antibiotic SCARs.  In Aim 1, we will leverage advanced informatics and longitudinal EHR data for over 11 million patients from Partners HealthCare System since the 1980s to identify SCAR cases. We will create, optimize and standardize reproducible methods for finding SCAR cases and validating a cohort of SCAR patients. This iterative process will be used to refine and disseminate an electronic phenotype to be validated cross-institutionally.  In Aim 2, we will analyze SCAR prevalence and conduct a case-control study to identify drug-specific and patient-specific risk factors for antibiotic-associated SCARs. We will compare clinical sequelae, quality of life and adherence of SCAR patients compared to controls through validated survey instruments.  In Aim 3, we will identify candidate HLA and genetic associations from patients with validated antibiotic- associated SCARs. We will examine difference in genetic risk in minority and health disparity populations and predict that we will be powered to establish HLA associations for vancomycin DRESS (i.e., drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) and sulfonamide antimicrobial and beta-lactam SCAR. HLA alone, or in combination with clinical risk factors, can lead to improved SCAR prevention and early diagnosis. We will establish a data sharing platform, in the form of an online electronic phenotype and patient registry, that can be used to enlarge SCAR cohorts for future large-scale genomics studies.  The roadmap we develop will translate into the development of electronic phenotypes for serious adverse drug reactions that facilitate genetic discovery. Knowledge gained will be crucial to the translation of genetic data into clinical decision making. This is in close alignment with NIH’s research mission to accelerate genetic discovery for iatrogenic and preventable drug-induced diseases that will translate into prevention, earlier diagnosis and an enhanced mechanistic understanding that may lead to targeted therapeutic approaches. Narrative  Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) result in substantial morbidity, long term disability, health care burden and a mortality of 10-50%.

"Long Acting Injectable Depots for TB Therapy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Patient dosing adherence is often compromised by the complex pill regimes and long duration of current TB drug therapies. These challenges are exacerbated in settings for patients in many social and global settings where TB co-therapy with HIV positive patients is stigmatized. Long-acting drug delivery products should therefore play an important role to increase patient adherence and increase drug efficacy. This project will develop a new injectable depot technology that address a general target product profile that includes multiple-month delivery from a single injection, low volume and low viscosity formulations to reduce patient pain, combination drug formulation where required, sustained drug release with designable PK profiles, minimal initial and run-out burst release to increase safety and prevent drug resistance, and for global settings has low cost of goods and lowered cold-chain requirements. This depot technology also has the important translational product attributes of streamlined CMC and cGMP manufacturing that could lead to more rapid clinical development achievement. A new injectable depot product for TB therapy will be developed that is differentiated from current dispersal based formulation approaches by being a fully synthetic depot. The proposal is structured around 2 specific aims in the R61 phase and two further aims in the R33 phase: (1) Prodrug monomers made by synthetic chemistry are directly polymerized in a second synthetic step to create “drugamer” depot therapeutics that have the drugs built into the depot itself. Compared to current dispersion formulation approaches, the drugamers exhibit higher drug loading efficiencies, the ability to co-formulate drugs of different lipophilicities, and linear, individually tailorable PK profiles that minimize first- and last-week burst release. These PK profiles are kinetically controlled by the linker properties that are tied to the individual drugs, along with polymer architectural design. This aim will exploit a unique high throughput polymer library and screening platform at CSIRO Melbourne to identify lead injectable depot designs using bedaquiline and moxifloxicin as initial drug examples. Sophisticated LC-MS/MS PK characterization will assess the sustained PK profile together with PK/PK modeling. (2) Evolve and optimize depot lead candidates through efficacy in an initial TB model that allows higher throughput imaging characterization of activity. This will be followed by an Mtb model assessment and selection to a lead depot candidate; (3) Test and optimize the two lead drug depot candidates in an A/BSL3 Mtb model, by the criteria of PK/PD, efficacy and dose dependence, and dosing duration. The lead depot will also be characterized in accelerated stability studies to test whether they can avoid cold-chain storage. (4) Evaluate iterated up-selected depots in combination depots from mixing optimized bedaquiline and moxifloxacin depots, including dual PK profiling and PK/PD modeling. This same approach could also be expanded to develop future therapeutic products based on other combination drug depot designs. These favorable platform attributes motivate this this project as a potential new addition to the repertoire of anti-TB patient products. Project Narrative This project will provide TB therapy products that make patient adherence to monotherapy and combination drug therapy more effective. The new technology will provide drug dosing from a single injectable product that can be tailored to 2-3 month dosing from single injections. Patients will experience lower pain and the product will reduce the need for refrigeration to increase impact globally.",Long Acting Injectable Depots for TB Therapy,10236790,R61AI161820,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Automation ', ' Chemistry ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Dimethyl Sulfoxide ', ' DMSO ', ' Demasorb ', ' Demeso ', ' Dimethylsulphinyl ', ' Dimethylsulphoxide ', ' Domoso ', ' Dromisol ', ' Drug Combinations ', ' Drug resistance ', ' drug resistant ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Combination Drug Therapy ', ' Polychemotherapy ', ' combination chemotherapy ', ' combination pharmacotherapy ', ' combined drug therapy ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Exhibits ', ' Freeze Drying ', ' Freeze Dryings ', ' Lyophilization ', ' Future ', ' Cyclic GMP ', ' Guanosine Cyclic Monophosphate ', ' cGMP ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' Infection ', ' Kinetics ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Libraries ', ' Maps ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' M tb ', ' M tuberculosis ', ' M. tb ', ' M. tuberculosis ', ' mtb ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Play ', ' Polymers ', ' Powder dose form ', ' Powders ', ' Prodrugs ', ' Drug Precursors ', ' Pro-Drugs ', ' Refrigeration ', ' Robotics ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Safety ', ' Solubility ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translations ', ' Viscosity ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Weight ', ' Drug Delivery Systems ', ' Drug Delivery ', ' Injectable ', ' base ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Individual ', ' Cold Chains ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Attenuated ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' therapy duration ', ' Drug Formulations ', ' Moxifloxacin ', ' experience ', ' monomer ', ' solid state ', ' drug efficacy ', ' lipophilicity ', ' Structure ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Drug Interactions ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' HIV therapy ', ' pill ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' patient cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' treatment compliance ', ' compliance behavior ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Dose ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Polymer Chemistry ', ' Synthesis Chemistry ', ' Synthetic Chemistry ', ' Virulent ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' cost ', ' biosafety level 3 facility ', ' BSL-3 facility ', ' BSL3 facility ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Implant ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' tuberculosis drugs ', ' Antitubercular Drugs ', ' TB drugs ', ' anti-TB drugs ', ' anti-tuberculosis drugs ', ' antituberculosis drugs ', ' tuberculosis treatment ', ' TB therapy ', ' TB treatment ', ' tuberculosis therapy ', ' product development ', ' Regimen ', ' screening ', ' co-infection ', ' coinfection ', ' Formulation ', ' HIV/TB ', ' HIV/Mtb ', ' HIV/mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' HIV/tuberculosis ', ' M. tuberculosis/HIV ', ' clinical development ', ' Injections ', ' lead candidate ', ' chronic infection ', ' persistent infection ', ' first-in-human ', ' first in man ', ' drug release profile ', ' pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics ', ' PK/PD ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R61,2021,686389,WA-07
"Direct sub-second measurement of neuromodulator signaling during risky decision-making PROJECT SUMMARY Much work in decision neuroscience has been predicated on the hypothesis that dopaminergic signaling plays a critical role in value representations and their updating, and recent work has linked abnormalities in such value representations to specific features of psychiatric illness (e.g., anhedonia in major depression). However, despite the fundamental role that risk plays in evaluating choice options as well as the role sensitivity to risk plays in psychiatric illness, including anxiety disorders at one extreme and health risk behaviors like substance use at another other, an understanding of the neurobiology of risk remains elusive. Indirect evidence from pharmacological studies have suggested both serotoninergic and noradrengergic signaling may play roles in representations of risk; however, direct measurement of serotonin or norepinephrine signaling during risky choice has yet to be examined in humans. Recent advances by MPI Montague’s group allow the unprecedented ability to track neuromodulator responses with high temporal resolution and chemical specificity. Specifically, MPI Montague’s team is able to directly and simultaneously measure dopamine and serotonin responses in awake humans with the temporal resolution (~ 1 ms) required to examine the relationship of neuromodulator release with decision-making processes. For signal identification and extraction, the recording method uses machine-learning algorithms (elastic net regression) combined with electrochemistry using only off-the shelf hardware and software. The product of this ‘elastic net electrochemistry’ is recordings of in vivo neuromodulator fluctuations at sub-second resolution. This application merges the decision neuroscience expertise of MPI King-Casas with these advances of MPI Montague to directly examine serotonergic, noradrenergic, and dopaminergic functioning during risky choice. To achieve this goal, we will record neuromodulator responses in participants with medication-resistant epilepsy who already have intracranial depth electrodes in place for phase-II monitoring. Depth electrodes will be implanted by our neurosurgery colleagues at Virginia Tech’s medical affiliate Carilion Clinic (Carilion Clinic PI: Witcher). During recording, participants will perform i) a risk elicitation task (Holt & Laury type task) and ii) a reward learning task (multi-arm bandit task) that have been shown by our group and others both to reliably evoke neural responses associated with risk and representations as they are monitored in a standard (i.e., non-surgical) hospital suite. Depth recordings will be made using a standard montage that includes multiple contacts along the dorsal-rostral axis of the medial prefrontal cortex. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite the fundamental role that risk plays in evaluating choice options as well as the role sensitivity to risk plays in psychiatric illness, including anxiety disorders at one extreme and health risk behaviors like substance use at another other, an understanding of the neurobiology of risk remains elusive. Here, we take advantage of a new technology to directly measure serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine on a sub-second basis to investigate the neurocomputational role of these neurotransmitters in risky choice.",Direct sub-second measurement of neuromodulator signaling during risky decision-making,10141302,R01MH122948,"['Anxiety Disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Decision Making ', ' Dopamine ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electrochemistry ', ' Electrodes ', ' Implanted Electrodes ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Morale ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurotransmitters ', ' Nerve Transmitter Substances ', ' Neurosciences ', ' neurosurgery ', ' Norepinephrine ', ' Levarterenol ', ' Levonorepinephrine ', ' Noradrenaline ', ' Play ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Serotonin ', ' 5-HT ', ' 5-Hydroxytryptamine ', ' 5HT ', ' Enteramine ', ' Hippophaine ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Virginia ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Anhedonia ', ' base ', ' Dorsal ', ' Medial ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' awake ', ' Measurement ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Clinic ', ' experience ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' noradrenergic ', ' Participant ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' response ', ' Neuromodulator ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Outcome ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' Implant ', ' arm ', ' temporal measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' Pharmacology Study ', ' Pharmacological Study ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' ']",NIMH,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2021,654439,VA-09
"Predicting urinary continence status with sacral neuromodulation and botulinum toxin treatments PROJECT SUMMARY Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS) include urinary urgency, incontinence, and nocturia, afflict roughly 50% of the adult population, and have substantial, wide-ranging impact. Many gaps remain in our understanding of these symptoms, leading to inadequate treatment. Urgency urinary incontinence, one form of LUTS, was the focus of two recent multi-site clinical trials (Anticholinergic vs. Botox Comparison Study or ABC and Refractory Overactive Bladder: Sacral NEuromodulation vs. BoTulinum Toxin Assessment or ROSETTA). These trials compared the efficacy of urgency urinary incontinence therapies, 100 Units (U) Onabotulinum Toxin A (Botox) versus an anticholinergic medication (ABC) and 200U Botox versus sacral neuromodulation (SNM)(ROSETTA). These studies compared whether on average 100U Botox was superior to a standard anticholinergic regimen (ABC) and whether 200U Botox was superior to SNM (ROSETTA). The objective of this K01 proposal is to use the same clinical trial data to create predictive models that accurately estimate the likelihood that a patient will respond to Botox and SNM treatments, as well as the likelihood of developing urinary retention or urinary tract infections (risks associated with Botox treatment). In addition to medical histories and questionnaires some of the predictive models will incorporate diagnostic measurements, both standard and novel, from tests of bladder function (urodynamics). This approach will allow for the formal assessment of the utility of urodynamics in guiding treatment decisions, something that is currently debated in the field. This project will result in innovative models which can be used to: 1) predict whether a patient will respond to Botox and SNM treatments and the likelihood of adverse events (Botox only); 2) determine the utility of urodynamics data in predicting patient response to treatment and 3) identify patients that are resistant to treatment, so as to guide future research. These models will offer a patient specific, data-driven approach to treatment that will greatly benefit patient care and help reduce costs to the health care system. This project will also provide training in predictive modeling and clinical benign urology under the guidance of an experienced mentoring team. The candidate’s long-term objective is to lead a strong independent research program to design new therapies for patients with (LUTS) informed by both animal and human studies, and to match patients with suitable therapies based on individual patient characteristics (personalized medicine). PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will result in predictive models that clinicians can use to help guide patients when selecting third line therapies for urgency incontinence; providing patients with tailored estimates of how likely it is that they will respond successfully to sacral neuromodulation or intradetrusor Onabotulinum Toxin A. These models will make use of individual characteristics (i.e. personalized medicine), rather than using the current practice, a one-size-fits-all approach, for guiding treatment selection. By improving the match between therapies and patients, it is expected that these models will ultimately improve the quality of treatment that patients receive as well as reduce healthcare costs.",Predicting urinary continence status with sacral neuromodulation and botulinum toxin treatments,10141226,K01DK121866,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Animals ', ' Bladder ', ' Bladder Urinary System ', ' urinary bladder ', ' Botulinum Toxins ', ' Botulin ', ' Clostridium botulinum Toxins ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Counseling ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Nocturia ', ' Nycturia ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Probability ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Residual volume ', ' Testing ', ' Urinary Incontinence ', ' Urinary tract infection ', ' Urinary tract infectious disease ', ' urinary infection ', ' Urodynamics ', ' Urology ', ' Woman ', ' Urinary Retention ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Catheters ', ' micturition urgency ', ' Urgency to pass urine ', ' Urgent desire to urinate ', ' urinary urgency ', ' urination urgency ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' therapy selection ', ' Urge Incontinence ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Refractory ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' alpha Toxin ', ' α-Toxin ', ' Measurement ', ' Anti-Cholinergics ', ' Anticholinergic Agents ', ' Anticholinergics ', ' Medical History ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Therapeutic Human Experimentation ', ' Therapeutic Research ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' bladder continence ', ' micturition control ', ' urinary continence ', ' urinary control ', ' urination control ', ' Bladder Control ', ' lower urinary tract symptoms ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Botox ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Overactive Bladder ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Multi-center clinical trial ', ' Multi-site clinical trial ', ' Multicenter clinical trial ', ' Multisite clinical trial ', ' Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' trial comparing ', ' primary outcome ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' compare efficacy ', ' shared decision making ', ' Regimen ', ' signal processing ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' individual patient ', ' patient response ', ' patient specific response ', ' responsive patient ', ' infection risk ', ' feature selection ', ' ']",NIDDK,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,K01,2021,137785,WI-05
"Model-based credit assignment Abstract How the brain forms, tunes, and uses predictive models that specify the causal links between stimuli in the environment, our choices, and their outcomes is a fundamental question in Psychology and Neuroscience. A great deal of progress has been made identifying the neural computations theorized to form and update predictive models. This research has played a central role in the rise of computational psychiatry, but its relevance to clinical disorders has been limited in part by the use of relatively simple learning/choice paradigms that capture only a narrow subset of the structural complexity of real-world learning.  In order to make sound predictions in a complex world, the brain needs to attribute good and bad outcomes to their most likely causes, a problem known as “credit assignment”. There is little understanding of how outcomes are attributed to their most likely causes in structured real-world environments. Most real-world learning occurs in complex and structured environments, such as hierarchical systems (e.g. seasonal events, social hierarchies, contextual rules, etc.). Recent evidence suggests that humans can use an understanding of the environment’s causal structure to attribute outcomes to their most likely causes (which I call “model-based credit assignment)”, rather than simply attributing them to the most recently experienced stimuli and choices that were made (which I call “model-free” credit assignment), as standard models have proposed.  The purpose of the present proposal is to develop the first neural model of model-based credit assignment. We hypothesize that the brain reinstates the cause when a reinforcement outcome is experienced to associate with the outcome. In other words, so that “fire-together/wire-together” plasticity mechanisms can link a choice with an outcome, the choice representation and the outcome representation must both be active at the same time even though the causal choice or event may have actually occurred some time beforehand.  To test this and other predictions, we will integrate mathematical descriptions of learning and decision making with “representational” analysis methods that allow inferences to be made about the information represented in brain areas, applied to fMRI and scalp EEG data. fMRI will reveal how neural learning signals update neural representations of likely causes during learning, while EEG will reveal the timing of the hypothesized reinstatement. These experiments will set the stage to apply the insights gained to investigate how the brain attributes outcomes to more abstract “latent” causes in hierarchically structured environments prevalent in the real world. The proposed project will thus move this general program of research strategy toward learning tasks that better reflect the complexity and structure in many real-world learning/choice situations important for both typical and atypical individuals. Project Narrative Research into how the brain forms and tunes predictive models that specify the causal relationships between stimuli in the environment, our actions, and their outcomes has made dramatic strides by identifying key learning computations in the brain in both typical and atypical individuals. However, the application of this research to clinical disorders has been limited by use of relatively simple learning/choice tasks that do not capture much of the structural complexity of real-world learning. The present project aims to develop the first neural model specifying how reinforcement outcomes are attributed to their most likely causes in such structured environments.",Model-based credit assignment,10083230,R56MH119116,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Anxiety ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Clams ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Environment ', ' Fire - disasters ', ' Fires ', ' fire ', ' Goals ', ' Social Hierarchy ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Allergy ', ' Learning ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Play ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychology ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Restaurants ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Scalp structure ', ' Scalp ', ' Shellfish ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Social Dominance ', ' Dominance Hierarchy ', ' sound ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Taxonomy ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' base ', ' Lateral ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Scallop ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Reaction ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Update ', ' Process ', ' Allergic Reaction ', ' Behavioral ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Coupled ', ' neural model ', ' two-dimensional ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Bayesian Modeling ', ' Bayesian adaptive designs ', ' Bayesian adaptive models ', ' Bayesian belief network ', ' Bayesian belief updating model ', ' Bayesian framework ', ' Bayesian hierarchical model ', ' Bayesian network model ', ' Bayesian nonparametric models ', ' Bayesian spatial data model ', ' Bayesian spatial image models ', ' Bayesian spatial models ', ' Bayesian statistical models ', ' Bayesian tracking algorithms ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' Service delivery model ', ' Service model ', ' care delivery model ', ' health care delivery model ', ' healthcare delivery model ', ' Bayesian learning ', ' Bayesian machine learning ', ' functional magnetic resonance imaging/electroencephalography ', ' fMRI/EEG ', ' shellfish hypersensitivity ', ' allergic to shellfish ', ' allergy to shellfish ', ' shellfish allergy ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R56,2021,384992,CA-03
"Identification of Distinct Multimodal Biotypes of PTSD Using Data Driven Approach: A Multisite Big Data Study Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a highly prevalent and debilitating disorder. Despite efforts to characterize the pathophysiology of PTSD and its heterogenity, no objective biomarker have been established to aid in diagnosis, and prediction of treatment response. This K01 presents a program for research and training that will support the applicant on a path towards becoming an independent investigator, focused on utilizing a data-driven computational approach and machine learning techniques to identify multimodal neural biomarkers of PTSD (supervised) and multimodal biotypes of PTSD (unsupervised) and explore whether such biotypes could be used to predict response to prolonged exposure (PE), the first line treatment for PTSD. The training plan builds on the candidate’s prior training and experience and capitalizes on a mentorship team and a research environment to foster development of the candidate’s expertise in 1) the neural and behavioral basis of PTSD and anxiety disorders; 2) multimodal data fusion analysis and latent dimension interpretation with data-driven computational approaches and data reproducibility; and 3) patient-oriented translational research in anxiety disorders. This research project will apply both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques on multimodal MRI data from the largest existing PTSD dataset (N~3000 from the ENIGMA-PTSD working group). Biotypes identified from this large dataset will then be extended to clinical treatment data. The results of the proposed research will be vital to aid in finding neural biomarkers of PTSD and better predict different treatment outcomes through different biotype targets and will lead to a future R01 grant examining brain-symptoms association across anxiety and trauma-related disorders, and to use the newly identified PTSD biotypes to inform different treatment outcomes in a following R61/33. Together, the research and training experiences and expertise developed through this K01 award will support the applicant’s transition to research independence and ensure the applicant becomes a leading authority in the application of data-driven computational approaches in psychiatry research, and provide the basis for future NIMH grants to explore biotypes from multimodal brain imaging using data-driven computational approaches across anxiety-related disorders. PTSD can occur after a direct or indirect traumatic experience and is a highly prevalent and debilitating disorder. This research project use a big data and data-driven approaches to study the heterogenity of PTSD. In the long term, this line of research will aid in finding neural biomarkers of PTSD and better predict different treatment outcomes through different biotype targets, which will advance the

"A Quantitative Risk Model for Predicting Outcome and Identifying Structural Biomarkers of Treatment Targets in Oral Cancer on a Large Multi-Center Patient Cohort Post-resection prognostication for oral cavity cancers (OCC) is qualitative and potentially ambiguous. A significant subset (25-37%) of Stage I/II patients still develop local recurrence after treatment with surgery alone. The long-term goal of this proposal will be to create a Quantitative Risk Model (QRM) using machine learning and artificial intelligence to predict recurrence risk for Stage I/II patients using image-based biomarkers of aggression. The objective is to develop and validate state-of-the-art systems for biomarker imaging, quantification, and modeling to accurately predict risk of recurrence in cancer patients based on image analytics. The central hypothesis is that a quantitative, artificial intelligence approach to pathology will result in significantly greater prognostic value compared with manual microscope-based analysis. The rationale for this work is that tumor aggression can be predicted from patterns present in pathology images, given the existence of histological risk models that have been clinically validated in the past; however, these risk models are not in widespread use because they are less accurate, robust, and transportable to the larger community of pathologists. This proposal will test the central hypothesis through three specific aims: (1) Develop an analysis pipeline that can accurately predict recurrence risk for Stage I/II OCC patients and identify treatment targets (e.g. adaptive local immune response and angiogenesis); (2) Demonstrate robust performance across a multi-site data cohort collected from seven national and international centers; and (3) Distil the results of QRM analysis to synoptic pathology reporting, demonstrating the ability of QRM to interface with standard clinical reporting tools. The innovation for addressing these aims comes from a unique application of active learning for training artificial intelligence to recognize tissue structures, new features for quantifying tissue architecture based on the interface between tumor and host, and a novel approach for large cross-site validation. Moreover, this proposal develops a unique mapping between computational pathology and commonly-used synoptic reporting variables, enabling rapid uptake of this work into existing clinical workflows. This research is significant because it provides personalized outcome predictions for a niche group of undertreated patients with limited options and can serve as the foundation for designing future clinical trials through identification of treatment targets. Multi-site training and evaluation, combined with AI-to-report mapping, will be broadly applicable to a large group of computational approaches, bridging the gap between engineering research labs and clinical application. The expected outcome of this work is a trained model for predicting Stage I/II OCC recurrence, identification of treatment targets, and mapping to synoptic reports, as well as a broadly-applicable workflow for the broader computational pathology community. This project will have a large positive impact on patients and surgical pathologists by enabling rapid, accurate prognosis and directed treatment plans in an easy-to-use pipeline that integrates seamlessly into existing clinical workflows. We aim to develop a quantitative risk model for oral cavity cancer patients, 25-37% of whom will experience debilitating post-treatment recurrence. Using state-of-the-art machine learning and artificial intelligence methods, we will develop and validate our risk model on a large multi-site cohort of patients, and develop an AI-assisted synoptic report-filling tool for integrating into clinical practice. A computational pathology approach to characterizing disease will help identify patients for whom aggressive multimodality therapy will improve outcomes and post-treatment quality of life.",A Quantitative Risk Model for Predicting Outcome and Identifying Structural Biomarkers of Treatment Targets in Oral Cancer on a Large Multi-Center Patient Cohort,10149283,R01DE028741,"['Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Algorithms ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Combined Modality Therapy ', ' Multimodal Therapy ', ' Multimodal Treatment ', ' combination therapy ', ' combined modality treatment ', ' combined treatment ', ' multi-modal therapy ', ' multi-modal treatment ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Medical Economics ', ' Elements ', ' Engineering ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Oral Stage ', ' Pathology ', ' Surgical Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative ', ' pressure ', ' Productivity ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' radio-therapy ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Semantics ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Workload ', ' Work Load ', ' Salvage Therapy ', ' Salvage-Tx ', ' Blinded ', ' malignant mouth neoplasm ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Tumor ', ' Malignant Oral Neoplasm ', ' Mouth Cancer ', ' Oral Cancer ', ' malignant mouth tumor ', ' oral cavity cancer ', ' base ', ' quality assurance ', ' Microscope ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' prognostic ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Training ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Active Learning ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' uptake ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' angiogenesis ', ' Pathologist ', ' Companions ', ' tool ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Slide ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Head and Neck ', ' Head and neck structure ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' international center ', ' cohort ', ' treatment planning ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' Reporting ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Pathology Report ', ' Modeling ', ' cancer recurrence ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Head and Neck Surgery ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Collection ', ' Validation ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' digital ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer type ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' tumor ', ' high risk ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' clinical practice ', ' screening ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' prognostic value ', ' prognostic ability ', ' prognostic power ', ' prognostic utility ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' improved outcome ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' digital pathology ', ' pathology imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' analysis pipeline ', ' computational pipelines ', ' feature extraction ', ' segmentation algorithm ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NIDCR,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2021,380042,NY-26
"Biomedical Informatics Tools for Applied Perioperative Physiology Project Summary / Abstract Even though US hospitals have widely adopted electronic health record (EHR) documentation of patient care, interoperability of these systems remains an issue, leading to challenges in data integration. In the operating room (OR) setting, during surgery, physiological waveforms (arterial pressure, EKG, SpO2, central venous pressure, etc.) represent a large source of information used by clinical monitors to extract and display information in order for healthcare providers to make clinical decisions. Integration and synchronization of high-quality EHR and physiological waveform data in large datasets of surgical patients would allow machine learning and deep learning approaches to plumb these datasets for clinically relevant signatures that would promote advanced OR patient monitoring systems to define present state, predict state trajectory, suggest effective counter measures to minimize patients decompensated states, and define the usefulness and efficacy of new monitoring devices. The objective of this proposal is to focus the resources of an interdisciplinary team from academia (University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), University of California Irvine (UCI), and Carnegie Mellon University Computer Sciences), industry (Edwards Lifesciences Critical Care), and clinical medicine (anesthesiology, surgery, and critical care at UCLA, UCI, Beth Israel, and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center) to create, develop, and organize large surgical datasets combining EHR and high fidelity physiological waveform data, to make these datasets freely accessible, and to develop new predictive/forecasting monitoring systems for the surgical patients. The study will begin with the development of a machine learning algorithm to predict cardiovascular collapse during surgery. This algorithm development will be based on physiological signatures predictive of cardiovascular collapse identified in the animal models of shock. The study hypothesis is that the combination of two separate OR databases containing EHR and physiological waveforms will allow for training and development of monitoring solutions, predictive and/or prescriptive analytics tools, clinical decision support, and validate them on an independent, external validation database. The surgical setting is relevant because although 5.7 million Americans are admitted annually to an Intensive Care Unit, more than 50 million undergo surgery. OR databases are unique in medicine because: 1) Changes occur quickly and the lead-time before an event is compressed; 2) Knowledge of baseline/pre-stress status of surgical patients allows normalization, calibration, and markedly enhances prediction; 3) Continuous and immediate presence of dense skilled acute care practitioners allows faster implementation of complex treatment algorithms in the OR; and 4) Defined stages, procedures, and stressors allow building large common relational database registries. By helping to focus the provider's attention on significant events and changes in the patient's state and by suggesting physiological interpretations of that state, such systems will permit early detection of complex problems and provide guidance on therapeutic interventions improving patient outcomes.

"Development of End-To-End Clinical Decision Support Tools To Prevent Cardiotoxic Drug Response SUMMARY Drug-induced cardiac toxicity, in the form of QT prolongation and torsade de pointes, is an uncommon but devastating side effect of over one hundred currently marketed drugs. The ubiquity of drug-induced QT prolongation (diLQTS) across medical specialties and conditions creates a challenge for providers seeking to prescribe known QT-prolonging medications, particularly for non-cardiac conditions. Work by our group to develop automated clinical decision support (CDS) tools that alert providers of patient risk has shown promise towards reducing the number of prescriptions to at-risk individuals. However, these tools rely on a history of an electrocardiogram (ECG) with QT prolongation to identify at-risk patients, and thus exclude a large number of potentially at-risk individuals who have not had an ECG within our system. Through a unique institutional partnership with Google, in which a copy of our entire electronic health record (EHR) is stored on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), we have developed preliminary deep-learning models to predict risk of diLQTS. We have also validated the genetic association with the QT interval and diLQTS across several real-world populations using an aggregate polygenic risk score. Through creation of an institutional biobank with certification for clinical application of results, as well as cloud-based integration of EHR data with genetic data, we have the capability to leverage our existing infrastructure to study the role of deep learning and genetics to reduce the risk of diLQTS. This investigation will combine our unique research and clinical infrastructure on the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus with our investigative team composed of experts in the study of pharmacogenomics and medical informatics to develop and study an end-to-end CDS tool incorporating genetics and deep learning to predict risk of diLQTS. The specific aims of this application include the following: (1) develop and test a cloud-based, deep-learning model using EHR data on in- and outpatients to predict risk of diLQTS; (2) validate genetic predictors of diLQTS using institutional biobank samples, and a multi-ethnic external population; and (3) develop and test CDS tools using these advanced methods to reduce the risk of diLQTS. We will use a common data model (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership) mapped from EHR data, as well as a custom DNA array (Multi-Ethnic Genotyping Array) designed for imputation across a variety of non-European ancestries, to ensure that the our prediction model and findings from this study can be replicated in other institutions and populations in the future. In such a way, this investigation will not only provide insight into the use of machine learning and genetics for risk prediction of diLQTS, but it will also create a blueprint for future advanced CDS development for other conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is the development of a clinical decision support tool that can be used to predict the risk of drug-induced QT prolongation based on deep learning and genetics. This tool could be used to prevent potentially fatal side effects of medications when alternatives are available, or increase vigilance when safer alternatives are not available.

"The Role of Neuronal Ensembles Supporting Auditory Fear Conditioning (Engrams) in the Amygdala in Memory Formation, Generalization and Extinction Project Summary/Abstract Memory may be defined as the retention over time of internal representations gained through experience, and the capacity to reconstruct these representations at later times (Dudai 2007). These internal representations are thought to be encoded by long-lasting physical brain changes (memory traces or `engrams') (Josselyn, Kohler & Frankland 2015, 2017; Tonegawa et al. 2015; Schacter 2001). Remembering fear-evoking events is adaptive; it helps one make future choices based on past experience. It may even be beneficial to generalize some fearful memories. However, excessive fear generalization or treating no-longer threatening stimuli as dangerous may be maladaptive. Indeed, recurrent or inappropriately expressed fearful memories are a major component of several psychiatric diseases, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety. Therefore, understanding how memory traces for fearful events are formed, change over time, under what conditions they remain specific or generalize, and how they are impacted by behavioral extinction are critical questions to not only understanding how the brain uses information but also for informing the development of new treatment/prevention strategies for disorders characterized by inappropriate fear memories. Here two PIs (Drs. Josselyn and Frankland), both New Investigators, will combine their expertise to address these important questions. Because all techniques are associated with caveats and limitations, we will use a variety of techniques including optogenetic manipulation, brain-wide neuronal activity mapping and the use of graph-theory to produce “engram maps” and real time in vivo calcium imaging combined with behavior. Together, the ability to manipulate and observe an engram as it forms, changes over time and with behavioral extinction is innovative and may lead to a shift in the very definition of an engram, as well as increase our understanding for developing treatments aimed at resolving inappropriate fear memories. Project Narrative More effective treatment approaches for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or other anxiety disorders will be facilitated by better understanding how the brain forms memory traces supporting fear memories, how these change over time and with extinction.","The Role of Neuronal Ensembles Supporting Auditory Fear Conditioning (Engrams) in the Amygdala in Memory Formation, Generalization and Extinction",10087966,R01MH119421,"['Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Calcium ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Endoscopes ', ' Extinction (Psychology) ', ' Extinction ', ' behavioral extinction ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Freezing ', ' Future ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Maps ', ' Memory ', ' Microscopy ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' post-trauma stress disorder ', ' posttrauma stress disorder ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Virus ', ' Halorhodopsins ', ' Halorhodopsin Chromoprotein ', ' Opsin ', ' Rod-Opsin ', ' Mediating ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization ', ' FISH Technic ', ' FISH Technique ', ' FISH analysis ', ' FISH assay ', ' Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization ', ' base ', ' Lateral ', ' Immediate-Early Genes ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Auditory ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Nuclear ', ' experience ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Address ', ' fear conditioning ', ' conditioned fear ', ' Data ', ' Retrieval ', ' Wild Type Mouse ', ' wildtype mouse ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' neuronal excitability ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' therapy development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' treatment strategy ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' optogenetics ', ' fear memory ', ' memory consolidation ', ' graph theory ', ' in vivo calcium imaging ', ' In vivo two-photon calcium imaging ', ' recruit ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' data analysis pipeline ', ' data processing pipeline ', ' ']",NIMH,HOSPITAL FOR SICK CHLDRN (TORONTO),R01,2021,337780,
"Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy There are 65 million people worldwide with epilepsy and 150,000 new cases of epilepsy are diagnosed in the US annually. However, treatment options for epilepsy remain inadequate, with many patients suffering from treatment-resistant seizures, cognitive comorbidities and the negative side effects of treatment. A major obstacle to progress towards the development of new therapies is the fact that preclinical epilepsy research typically requires labor-intensive and expensive 24/7 video-EEG monitoring of seizures that rests on the subjective scoring of seizure phenotypes by human observers (as exemplified by the widely used Racine scale of behavioral seizures). Recently, the Datta lab showed that complex animal behaviors are structured in stereotyped modules (“syllables”) at sub-second timescales and arranged according to specific rules (“grammar”). These syllables can be detected without observer bias using a method called motion sequencing (MoSeq) that employs video imaging with a 3D camera combined with artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted video analysis to characterize behavior. Through collaboration between the Soltesz and Datta labs, exciting data were obtained that demonstrated that MoSeq can be adapted for epilepsy research to perform objective, inexpensive and automated phenotyping of mice in a mouse model of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy. Here we propose to test and improve MoSeq further to address long-standing, fundamental challenges in epilepsy research. This includes the development of an objective alternative to the Racine scale, testing of MoSeq as an automated anti-epileptic drug (AED) screening method, and the development of human observer- independent behavioral biomarkers for seizures, epileptogenesis, and cognitive comorbidities. In addition, we plan to dramatically extend the epilepsy-related capabilities of MoSeq to include the automated tracking of finer-scale body parts (e.g., forelimb and facial clonus) that are not possible with the current approach. Finally, we propose to develop the analysis pipeline for MoSeq into a form that is intuitive, inexpensive, user-friendly and thus easily sharable with the research community. We anticipate that these results will have a potentially transformative effect on the field by demonstrating the feasibility and power of automated, objective, user- independent, inexpensive analysis of both acquired and genetic epilepsy phenotypes. There is an urgent need for new therapies for patients with uncontrolled epilepsy.

"Personalized Patient data and behavioral nudges to improve adherence to chronic cardiovascular medications Abstract Our objective in this project is to employ population level pharmacy data and delivery of nudges via cell phone text messaging and artificially intelligent (AI) interactive chat bot to improve medication adherence and patient outcomes in 3 integrated healthcare delivery systems (HCS): University of Colorado Health System (UCHealth), VA Eastern Colorado Health Care System (VA), and Denver Health Medical Center (DH). We will identify patients with chronic cardiovascular (CV) conditions taking medications to treat hypertension, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, diabetes and/or hyperlipidemia. We will leverage pharmacy refill data to identify episodes of non-adherence through gaps in medication refills and randomize individuals to 1 of 4 study arms when they have a first refill gap: 1) usual care; 2) generic text message reminder; 3) tailored and engaging text messages optimized to facilitate behavior change; or 4) optimized text messages plus a pre- programmed AI interactive chat bot designed to support identification and resolution of barriers to medication refill and adherence. In the UG3 phase (year 1), we will develop and program a theoretically informed technology-based (a) text message library and (b) chat bot content library using multiple and iterative N of 1 within subject studies to optimize content for a range of diverse patients. These outcomes will inform a pilot intervention to demonstrate feasibility of delivering the intervention and preliminary effects in all 3 HCS. We will also engage patient, provider and health systems stakeholders in designing, refining, and implementing the pilot intervention. In the UH3 phase (years 2-5), we will conduct a pragmatic patient-level randomized intervention across 3 HCS to improve adherence to chronic CV medications. We will evaluate the intervention using a mixed methods approach and apply the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance) framework. In addition, we will assess the context and implementation processes to inform local tailoring, adaptations and modifications, and eventual expansion of the intervention. Project Narrative Given the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases that require ongoing treatment with medications, the problem of medication non-adherence is unlikely to go away and will grow. This study will employ population level pharmacy data to identify non-adherent patients and utilize ubiquitous cell phone technology to send them tailored, engaging and motivating text messages and text message based chat through an artificially intelligent (AI) interactive chat bot to improve cardiac medication adherence and patient outcomes in 3 integrated healthcare delivery systems. This study will advance medication adherence research and the intervention could be applied to multiple clinical conditions requiring medications for long term treatment and other NIH institutes.!",Personalized Patient data and behavioral nudges to improve adherence to chronic cardiovascular medications,10200136,UH3HL144163,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Colorado ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' Decision Making ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health delivery systems ', ' health services delivery ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hyperlipidemia ', ' Hyperlipemia ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Institutes ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Libraries ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Mapping Algorithmic State Space in the Human Brain Abstract Humans have a remarkable ability to flexibly interact with the environment. A compelling demonstration of this cognitive flexibility is our ability to respond correctly to novel contextual situations on the first attempt, without prior rehearsal. We refer to this ability as ‘ad hoc self-programming’: ‘ad hoc’ because these new behavioral repertoires are cobbled together on the fly, based on immediate demand, and then discarded when no longer necessary; ‘self-programming’ because the brain has to configure itself appropriately based on task demands and some combination of prior experience and/or instruction. The overall goal of our research effort is to understand the neurophysiological and computational basis for ad hoc self-programmed behavior.  Our previous U01 project (NS 108923) focused on how these programs of action are initially created. Our results thus far have revealed tantalizing notions of how the brain represents these programs and navigates through them. In this proposal, therefore, we focus on the question of how these mental programs are executed. Based on our preliminary findings and critical conceptual work, we propose that the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and ventral prefrontal cortex (vPFC) creates representations of the critical elements of these mental programs, including concepts such as ‘rules’ and ‘locations’, to allow for effective navigation through the algorithm.  These data suggest the existence of an ‘algorithmic state space’ represented in medial temporal and prefrontal regions. This proposal aims to understand the neurophysiological underpinnings of this algorithmic state space in humans. By studying humans, we will profit from our species’ powerful capacity for generalization to understand how such state spaces are constructed. We therefore leverage the unique opportunities available in human neuroscience research to record from single cells and population-level signals, as well as to use intracranial stimulation for causal testing, to address this challenging problem.  In Aim 1 we study the basic representations of algorithmic state space using a novel behavioral task that requires the immediate formation of unique plans of action. Aim 2 directly compares representations of algorithmic state space to that of physical space by juxtaposing balanced versions of spatial and algorithmic tasks in a virtual reality (VR) environment. Finally, in Aim 3, we test hypotheses regarding interactions between vPFC and MTL using intracranial stimulation. Project Narrative In our everyday lives, we frequently encounter situations we have never previously faced and yet are required to make an appropriate response on the first try. This ability to rapidly and flexibly ‘self-program’ is one of the hallmark features of human intelligence. The proposed studies leverage exciting new developments in neuroscience, neurosurgery, engineering, and artificial intelligence to understand the neuronal circuitry underlying this amazing capacity.",Mapping Algorithmic State Space in the Human Brain,10199622,U01NS121472,"['Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Elements ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Inpatients ', ' Intelligence ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' neurosurgery ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Task Performances ', ' Telemetry ', ' Telemetries ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Amaze ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' entorhinal cortex ', ' Entorhinal Area ', ' base ', ' Anterior ', ' Medial ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Individual ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' experience ', ' physical state ', ' rehearsal ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neuronal circuit ', ' neuronal circuitry ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' virtual reality ', ' Cinnamon ', ' Cinnamon - dietary ', ' cell cortex ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Instruction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' mental representation ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Implant ', ' way finding ', ' spatial navigation ', ' wayfinding ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' operation ', ' computational basis ', ' virtual reality environment ', ' immersive digital environment ', ' immersive environment ', ' immersive virtual environment ', ' immersive virtual reality ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NINDS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,U01,2021,1509141,TX-09
"eMERGE IV Northwest: A partnership to evaluate the use of genomic information in the health care of diverse participants Project Abstract eMERGE IV (E4) proposes to investigate the implementation of 15 “genomic risk assessment” (GRA) scores in a network-wide set of diverse participants. These GRAs will include polygenic risk score (PRS) information, as well as risk information, such as personal and family health history, environmental and social health determinants, and physical and lab measures. The GRA will aggregate these factors into a single score to identify those who would benefit from screening and other interventions. Substantial challenges must be addressed before genomic medicine is a part of standard medical care. We will collaborate to refine multi-ancestry GRAs and support the inclusion of non-genetic risk factors extracted from the electronic health record with innovative natural language processing approaches and apply them in a cohort enriched for Asian ancestry, and sexual and gender minorities. The specific aims of our proposal are designed to use an implementation science approach to advance the integration of genomic data into clinical practice, including evaluation of patient perspectives and economic outcomes, and broadening the impact of eMERGE through collaborations. The University of Washington Medicine dedication to preventative health in a learning health system and broad expertise across genomics, statistical, ethical, informatic, implementation, outcomes and economic disciplines will support this multi-site clinical trial. Specific Aims: Aim 1: Refine GRA scores and outcomes measures for five high impact conditions, considering stakeholder input, for implementation in the electronic health record. The conditions are: colorectal cancer, breast cancer, osteoporosis, coronary artery disease, and glaucoma. Aim 2: Integrate 15 GRA scores and electronic clinical decision support for management into clinical care and the EHR and capture clinical outcomes. Aim 3: Evaluate the implementation, effectiveness, and economic utility of GRA result return.

"Data-driven subtyping in major depressive disorder Abstract  Major depressive disorder contributes substantially to morbidity, mortality, and health care cost. Standard treatments are ineffective for up to a third of patients, so new treatment options are needed along with strategies to make more effective use of existing treatments. However, progress in expanding therapeutic options has been hindered by heterogeneity in clinical presentation and course of depression.  In other disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, and dementia, identifying disease subtypes has led to therapeutic discoveries. In major depressive disorder, efforts to identify subtypes based on clinical observation have yielded limited success, primarily because of the lack of availability of adequate cohorts for replication, and because those features most apparent to clinicians may not be the most relevant for differentiating subgroups. Efforts to leverage large electronic health record data sets for subtyping address some of these challenges, but standard approaches may not yield human-interpretable features nor those with value in prediction.  The investigators have developed methods for engineering features that balance utility in prediction with interpretability. Preliminary work by the investigators during a year of R56 support yielding 4 publications demonstrates that this approach indeed yields coherent topics without sacrificing predictive validity; electronic health records contain meaningful data that facilitates identification of interpretable patient subgroups. The present study draws on very large cohorts of individuals with major depression, defined by a validated algorithm, in electronic health records from two health systems. It will first apply methods developed by the investigators to identify MDD subtypes. These subtypes will then be examined in terms of predictive validity as well as interpretability by clinicians.  The study builds on a productive collaboration between a team experienced in mood disorder phenotyping and clinical investigation, analysis of large-scale longitudinal electronic health records, and development and application of innovative methods in machine learning that yield interpretable models rather than black boxes. Data-driven disease subtyping will facilitate clinically useful risk stratification as well as biological study of mood disorders. Narrative  The wide variation in symptoms of major depressive disorder complicates efforts to develop new treatments and make effective use of existing treatments. Applying machine learning methods to electronic health records will enable the identification of interpretable disease subgroups, enabling development of more targeted treatment strategies.",Data-driven subtyping in major depressive disorder,10211310,R01MH123804,"['Algorithms ', ' Biology ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Endocrine System Diseases ', ' Endocrine Diseases ', ' Endocrine Diseases and Manifestations ', ' endocrine disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Disorder ', ' Manuals ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Supervision ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' therapy selection ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Individual ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Dimensions ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Remission ', ' Disease remission ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' disease subgroups ', ' disease subtype ', ' disorder subtype ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' therapy resistant ', ' resistance to therapy ', ' resistant to therapy ', ' therapeutic resistance ', ' treatment resistance ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment strategy ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' clinical investigation ', ' phenomenological models ', ' phenomenology ', ' biomarker identification ', ' marker identification ', ' ineffective therapies ', ' ineffective treatment ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' clinical subtypes ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,832192,MA-08
"Brain-Computer Interface in dynamic tasks with deep learning and functional connectivity analysis Abstract The PI proposes a high-impact multi-disciplinary research project to develop and validate machine learning al- gorithms for shift-detection in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals with applications to brain-computer interface to make them more reliable. Brain-computer interface is a means of communication for severely disabled peo- ple by decoding brain responses and translating their detection into commands with applications such a virtual keyboard or robotic control systems. Current brain-computer interface systems cannot be efﬁciently deployed in clinical setting due to their inability to properly take into account the non-stationarity properties of the evoked brain responses in the electroencephalogram signal. This project aims at enhancing the brain decoding perfor- mance when the task changes over time. The PI proposes to investigate the effects of well deﬁned types of data shifts: covariate shift, probability shift, and concept shift to enhance brain decoding performance in changing tasks. The goals of this proposal are: 1) to characterize in event related potential (ERP) components neural signatures corresponding to task changes by using EEG recordings and machine learning techniques for single- trial detection. 2) to research in functional brain connectivity neural signature corresponding to task changes by using EEG recordings and directed model-based and model free techniques of functional brain connectivity. 3) to combine and adapt machine learning techniques to detect when changes occur during a task. This proposal will signiﬁcantly improve the infrastructure of research and education at California State University Fresno, Hispanic- Serving Institution and an Asian American and Native American Paciﬁc Islander-Serving Institution, introducing biomedical engineering research experiences to underrepresented minority and female students in computer science and psychology students. This would allow them to experience different stages of the scientiﬁc method, and acquire fundamental skills related to data science applied to physiological signals with potential impact on society for improving the life of severely disabled people. Public Health Relevance Statement Brain-computer interfaces may eventually be used routinely to replace or restore useful functions for people severely disabled by neuro-muscular disorders, and to improve rehabilitation strategies for people with strokes, head trauma, and other neurological disorders. In order to deploy the brain-computer interface technology in clinical setting, it is necessary to optimize their reliability by better understanding the type of changes in the brain evoked responses that may happen over time.

"Artificial Intelligence Driven Tools for Objective Surgical Performance Improvement Abstract / Summary Currently, supervised surgical training provides only a small fraction of surgical experience in the career of a practicing surgeon. Surgeons’ skill develops throughout their career. Surgeons benefit from supervised feedback from experts during training, but they lose such structured and specific feedback once they begin independent practice. Surgical skill is associated with patient outcomes. Therefore, supporting surgeons’ continuous professional learning through automated structured resources can improve patient care. The status quo for surgeons in practice is to measure patient outcomes or other process of care variables as indirect measures of their skill. These measures do not inform surgeons how to improve. The goal in this project is to develop tools to analyze videos of the surgical field to provide surgeons with unbiased skill assessments and specific feedback on how to improve. This project includes integration of these tools into a personalized surgical learning platform and evaluation of its effectiveness for surgeons’ skill acquisition. To achieve this goal, this project includes a multi-disciplinary team to include expertise in ophthalmology, surgical education, surgical data science, computer vision, machine learning and deep learning, statistics, and human-computer interaction. The video analysis tools developed in this project will enable the following for cataract surgery, one of the most common surgical procedures in the U.S. and across the world: 1) objective assessments of surgeons’ skill; 2) provide surgeons with specific feedback on how to improve that is personalized given their past performance; and 3) preliminary evidence of effectiveness of a personalized learning platform for surgeons’ skill acquisition. The anticipated impact of our work is to create a pathway in which the surgeon is incentivized to see themselves and their performance as part of the process of improving outcomes and value in care, and institutions have access to objective tools to create reproducible standards for surgical competency.

"Algorithm-based prevention and reduction of cancer health disparity arising from data inequality Ethnic minority groups have a long-term cumulative data disadvantage in biomedical research and clinical studies. Statistics have shown that over 90% of the samples in cancer-related GWAS and clinical omics projects were collected from Individuals of European ancestry. This severe data disadvantage of the ethnic minority groups is set to produce new health disparities as data-driven, algorithm-based biomedical research and clinical decisions become increasingly common. The new cancer disparity arising from data inequality can potentially impact all ethnic minority groups in all types of cancers where data inequality exists. Thus, its negative impact is not limited to the cancer types or subtypes for which significant ethnic disparities have already been evident. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to prevent or reduce the heath disparities arising from the data disadvantage of ethnic minority groups. The overall objective of this work is to obtain key knowledge and create open resources to establish a new paradigm for machine learning with multiethnic clinical omics data. Our central hypothesis is that the knowledge learned from data of the majority population can be transferred to improve machine learning performance on the data-disadvantaged ethnic minority groups. Guided by strong preliminary data, we will pursuit two specific aims to 1) Discover from cancer clinical omics data and genotype-phenotype data: under what conditions and to what extent the transfer learning scheme improves machine learning model performance on data-disadvantaged ethnic minority groups; 2) Create an open resource system for unbiased multiethnic machine learning to prevent or reduce new health disparities arising from the data disadvantage of ethnic minorities. The approach is innovative because it represents a substantive departure from the status quo by shifting the paradigm of multiethnic machine learning from mixture learning and independent learning schemes to a transfer learning scheme. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to establish a new paradigm for unbiased multiethnic machine learning and to provide an open resource system to facilitate the paradigm shift, and thus to prevent or reduce health disparities arising from the data disadvantage of ethnic minorities. Ethnic minorities have a severe data-disadvantage that is set to produce new health disparities as data-driven and algorithm-based biomedical research and clinical decisions become increasingly common. The proposed research addresses this challenge by discovering critical knowledge and creating open resources for a paradigm shift in multiethnic machine learning using cancer clinical omics data.

"Improving the representativeness of American Indian Tribal Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (TBRFSS) by machine learning and propensity score based data integration approach A1 PROJECT SUMMARY Previous studies showed discrepancies of health and behavior prevalence between American Indians (AI) population and other racial or ethnic groups. Most health surveys have certain limitations when studying AI population due to the small sample sizes for AI population. Data collected by AI Tribal Epidemiology Centers (TECs) provides an excellent opportunity to conduct research for AI population due to sufficient sample size and extensive information. However, most surveys conducted by TECs used non-probability sampling design (e.g. convenient sample) due to its lower cost and increased time efficiency. Non-probability sample may suffer from sampling, coverage and nonresponse errors without further proper adjustments. Such difficulties greatly hampers the analysis of AI population in health and behavior research. Our general hypothesis is that data integration by combining information from non-probability and probability samples can reduce sampling, coverage and nonresponse errors in original non-probability sample. The Goal of this project is to develop an accurate and robust data integration methodology for AI population analysis specifically tailored to health and behavior research. During the past years, we have 1) studied data integration using calibration and parametric modeling approaches; 2) investigated machine learning and propensity score modeling methods in survey sampling and other fields; and 3) assembled an experienced team of multi-disciplinary team of experts. In this project, we propose to capitalize on our expertise and fulfill the following Specific Aims: Aim 1. Develop a data integration approach using machine learning and propensity score modeling We will develop machine learning and propensity score based data integration approaches to combine information from non-probability and probability samples. Compared to existing methods (i.e., Calibration, Parametric approach), our proposed approaches are more robust against the failure of underlying model assumptions. The inference is more general and multi-purpose (e.g. one can estimate most parameters such as means, totals and percentiles). Simulation studies will be performed to compare our proposed methods with other existing methods. A computing package will be built to implement the method in other settings. Aim 2. Evaluate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method in AI health and behavior research We will use real data to validate the proposed methods in terms of accuracy and robustness to the various data types. The performance will also be assessed by comparing with results from existing data integration methods such as calibration and parametric modeling approaches. The planned study takes advantage of a unique data source and expands the impact of the Indian Health Service (IHS)-funded research. We expect this novel integration method will vertically advance the field by facilitating the analysis based on non-probability sample, which can provide in-depth understanding regarding the AI population health and behavior studies. Project Narrative The overall goal of this R21 project is to develop an accurate, robust and multi-purpose data integration methodology for AI population (non-probability sample) analysis specifically tailored to health and behavior research such as diabetes and smoking. The code implementing the proposed method will be released and is general enough to be applied to AI population studies of other fileds. The success of this study will vertically advance the field by facilitating the AI population analysis, which can provide a better guidance and new insights on the future precision personalized prevention and treatment of certain diseases.",Improving the representativeness of American Indian Tribal Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (TBRFSS) by machine learning and propensity score based data integration approach A1,10271402,R21MD014658,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Calibration ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' Community Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Ethnic People ', ' Ethnic Population ', ' Ethnicity People ', ' Ethnicity Population ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Health Fairs ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Kansas ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Oklahoma ', ' Probability ', ' Probability Samples ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Smoking ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' United States Indian Health Service ', ' Indian Health Service ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' cigarette use ', ' data quality ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Respondent ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Event ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' population-based study ', ' population-level study ', ' studies of populations ', ' study of the population ', ' Population Study ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' BRFSS ', ' Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System ', ' Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ', ' US State ', ' Geographic state ', ' tribe health ', ' tribal health ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Population Analysis ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Behavioral ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' cost ', ' data integration ', ' cluster computing ', ' data grid ', ' datagrid ', ' distributed computing ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' therapy development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' population health ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' individualized prevention ', ' personalized prevention ', ' precision prevention ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA HLTH SCIENCES CTR,R21,2021,109613,OK-05
"Long-term effectiveness of BPH/LUTS pharmacological therapies and using machine learning based predictive analytics to tailor treatment. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This Career Development Award will support Dr. Marvin Langston in his transition to independence as a translational researcher. His long-term research goals include understanding the etiology and outcomes of urologic conditions with an emphasis on prostate diseases (prostate cancer, prostatitis, and lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH/LUTS)); developing and validating clinical tools to improve and personalize treatment options; and implementing these tools in “real world” clinical settings.  BPH/LUTS is an extremely common set of conditions among older men and can be considered a progressive disease, mainly characterized by deteriorating LUTS over time which causes considerable bother and decreased quality of life, urinary retention, and death in rare cases. Conventional pharmacological treatment strategies fail in preventing long-term clinical outcomes in about 30% of treated patients. Despite a high volume of pharmacological research, there have been very limited advances in therapy for BPH/LUTS in recent years. Therefore, innovative and well-designed studies are needed to understand the long-term comparative effectiveness of contemporary BPH/LUTS pharmacological therapies while leveraging the clinical covariates that can be captured in “big data” sources such as the electronic health record.  To address these limitations, In Aim 1, Dr. Langston will evaluate the long-term comparative effectiveness of BPH/LUTS pharmacological therapies in an observational study drawn from the Kaiser Permanente membership population, a fully integrated healthcare network. If well designed studies demonstrate that contemporary pharmacological approaches are not more effective at preventing long-term BPH/LUTS progression than conventional approaches alone, then personalized treatment options may ultimately provide the best strategy for reducing long-term BPH/LUTS progression. Therefore, in Aim 2 Dr. Langston will develop and validate predictive models using demographic, clinical, and laboratory data available at the time of BPH/LUTS diagnosis to identify patients at increased risk of long-term BPH/LUTS clinical outcomes (acute urinary retention and BPH surgery) using machine learning based predictive analytics.  As the volume, availability, and access to electronic data increases, so does the need for scientists with the content and methodologic expertise to correctly use and translate these data into improved urology care. This K01 provides the training for Dr. Langston to meet this challenge as a translational researcher and compete successfully for future R01 funding. PROJECT NARRATIVE Lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH/LUTS) is an extremely common set of conditions among older men, yet conventional pharmacological treatment strategies fail in preventing long-term clinical outcomes in about 30% of treated patients. This project seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of contemporary treatment strategies and use predictive modeling to determine which patients are likely to exhibit long-term BPH/LUTS progression.

"Tracking pre-seizure dynamics to predict and control seizures Epileptic seizures are unpredictable events that significantly reduce quality of life. Predicting when the next seizure would occur could both prepare persons with epilepsy and their caregivers, and potentially aid in the treatment of seizures. Animal models of epilepsy provide an opportunity to explore the nature of brain activity in the period leading up to seizures. Using both mouse and rat models of generalized absence epilepsy, we have found a specific build up of thalamic neural spiking activity for several seconds before each seizure. This novel electrophysiological signature occurs in the absence of any overt epileptiform EEG activity. We propose to identify the neural circuits that are responsible for pre-seizure activity using high-density multi-channel silicon probes to record broadly across seizure-generating networks in the mouse. We will also measure calcium ion levels, a readout of neural activity, in neuronal cell bodies and their output axons using fluorescent calcium indicators (GCaMPs) and multiphoton microscopy to capture a highly complementary component of pre-seizure activity with high spatial resolution. Neural activity data will be collected together with EEG, locomotion signals, sensory-evoked responses, and pupil diameter to create a comprehensive multimodal stream of pre-seizure activity. This information will be fed into unbiased machine learning approaches to develop predictive algorithms. We will directly test coupling strength within thalamocortical pre-seizure networks by conducting network-level and targeted single-cell recordings in acute brain slices. To determine a specific role of pre- seizure networks in generating seizures, we will test whether chemogenetic or optogenetic silencing of key pre-seizure network elements reduces seizure incidence or severity. Finally, we will test whether we can use seizure-predictive signals to intervene in real-time and prevent seizures before they take hold. Together, these experiments will provide proof of concept for a novel therapeutic approach: targeting the pre-seizure state to improve seizure control.

"Adaptation and pilot implementation of a validated, electronic real time clinical decision support tool for care of Pneumonia patients in 12 Utah Urgent Care Centers Project Summary Clinicians’ ability to accurately diagnose pneumonia and choose appropriate treatment is enhanced by well- designed clinical decision support (CDS), thereby increasing patient safety. Pneumonia CDS has historically been focused on inpatient settings, but ambulatory care settings with high pneumonia patient volumes and different care processes also need CDS. We propose to adapt and evaluate an innovative, validated electronic clinical decision support (CDS) tool based on consensus guidelines for pneumonia (ePNa) to urgent care centers (UCC). The proposal supports four aims: 1) Adapt ePNa for UCC and after in silico testing, pilot it among “super user” clinicians during UCC shifts and assess its usability. ePNa needs adaptation for the limited patient data available in UCC, calibration of severity measures for lower observed mortality, and a chest imaging prompt in patients with pneumonia signs and symptoms. ePNa for UCC will incorporate the artificial intelligence CheXpert model to provide real-time (within seconds) electronic classification of chest images for elements of pneumonia diagnosis and treatment (radiographic pneumonia, single vs multiple lobes, and pleural effusion). 2) Use the CFIR framework, a focus group of UCC clinicians, and workflow observations to identify barriers and facilitators to adaptation and implementation of ePNa to UCC. 3) Test the implementation strategy by deploying ePNa at one of two randomly chosen Intermountain Healthcare UCC clusters each with about 800 annual pneumonia patients - the other a usual care control. 4) Co-primary outcomes are a) Patients diagnosed with pneumonia without chest imaging will be ≥50% lower in the ePNa cluster. b) Antibiotic prescribing for treatment of pneumonia will be ≥90% consistent with consensus guidelines and higher in the ePNa cluster. Safety measures will be unplanned subsequent 7-day ED visits/hospitalizations and 30-day mortality. Based on this rigorous pilot study, we anticipate a subsequent multi-system cluster-randomized trial including Cerner systems outside Utah. Our work incorporates the Five Rights of CDS to ensure that the strengths of this technology are optimized in the clinical environment. We will leverage experience in innovative pneumonia research, pioneering CDS, and implementation science available at Intermountain to successfully complete this proposal. The proposal will be facilitated by and disseminated through Intermountain relationships with the PCORnet Learning Health Systems Network, PCOR CDS Learning Network, the Healthcare Services Platform Consortium, Cerner, and clinicaltrials.gov. Our innovative proposal promises to advance safety for patients suspected of pneumonia in an understudied, high-volume ambulatory care setting. Project Narrative Pneumonia is the most common serious infection among adults, but diagnosis and treatment decisions vary between different clinicians. We will adapt for free standing urgent care clinics a validated, real-time, emergency department deployed, electronic pneumonia clinical decision support tool (ePNa). We hypothesize successful implementation of ePNa using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research into a cluster of urgent care clinics which treat about 800 pneumonia patients annually will improve care processes and patient outcomes compared to a similar cluster of usual care clinics.","Adaptation and pilot implementation of a validated, electronic real time clinical decision support tool for care of Pneumonia patients in 12 Utah Urgent Care Centers",10268162,R18HS026886,[''],AHRQ,"IHC HEALTH SERVICES, INC.",R18,2021,444010,UT-02
"Endogenous fluorescence lifetime endoscopy for early detection of oral cancer and dysplasia The American Cancer Society estimates that 48,330 new cases of cancer in the oral cavity and pharynx will be reported this year. When diagnosed at early stages, the 5-year survival rate is 83%. However, when diagnosed at intermediate or advance stages, the 5-year survival rate drops to 62% and 38%, respectively. In addition, while early stage treatment may only require minor surgery to remove the localized tumor, later stage treatment could require surgical removal of parts of the face and neck, hence drastically reducing the patient’s quality of life. Unfortunately, benign oral lesions are sometimes difficult to distinguish from dysplasia or early invasive cancer even for healthcare professionals. As a result, only 31% of patients are diagnosed at early stages despite the fact that the oral cavity is easily accessible for direct examination. Hence, there is a critical need for new clinical technologies for reliable early diagnosis of oral cancer and dysplasia. Several screening tools for oral cancer have been commercially available, including exfoliative cytology, vital staining, salivary test, and optical interrogation; however, none of them have been demonstrated to be capable of clinically relevant sensitivity and specificity. We hypothesize that several biomarkers for oral cancer and dysplasia can be accurately quantified by endogenous fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) thus enabling levels of sensitivity and specificity adequate for early detection. This bioengineering research grant focuses on developing and validating a cost-effective wide-field multispectral FLIM endoscope for noninvasive in situ detection of oral cancer and dysplasia. To that end we have developed three specific aims. Aim 1: To design and build a cost-effective multispectral FLIM endoscope for in vivo imaging of epithelial tissue in the oral cavity. Aim 2: To develop algorithms for fast and automated FLIM based early detection of oral epithelial cancer and dysplasia. Aim 3: To quantify prospectively in a pilot clinical study the capability of the proposed FLIM endoscopic tools for noninvasively early detection of oral epithelial cancer and dysplasia. The successful completion of these aims will result in a novel, accurate and cost-effective clinical tool for noninvasive in situ early detection of cancer and dysplasia. Such a tool could potentially help to improve significantly both the life expectancy and the quality of life for the more than 33,000 oral cancer patients being diagnosed each year at intermediate and advance stages. Beyond early diagnosis, this tool could also assist at every step involved on the clinical management of oral cancer patients, including treatment guidance and monitoring of disease recurrence. Finally, the demonstrated success of this clinical tool in oral epithelial cancer will herald future success with other cancers of epithelial origin, which accounts for more than 80% of all cancers. Early detection of both new and recurrent oral cancer holds great promise for improving both the survival rate and the quality of live of these patients. The proposed work is to develop a clinical tool capable of quantifying noninvasively different biomarkers associated to oral epithelial cancer progression and detecting early stage oral cancer and dysplasia. Such tool will revolutionize oral epithelial cancer management by allowing not only early screening and diagnosis, but also treatment guidance and monitoring for disease recurrence.",Endogenous

"Improving Cancer Screening Through A Tailored Technology-Based Intervention Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States. Health disparities exist in cancer screening and mortality. Although cancer mortality rates have decreased steadily over the past 25 years, the racial gap persists, and socioeconomic disparities are widening. Improved early detection and treatment can decrease cancer mortality, but many barriers exist to screening uptake. Cancer screening is often a trade-off for both patients and clinicians among different cancer screenings and other preventive opportunities, each of which have their own barriers to completion. This study seeks to improve quality of care and reduce health disparities in cancer mortality by using informatics to better tailor clinical discussions in order to enhance patient motivation to receive screening services and help overcome barriers to screening. The study has the following aims: 1) to develop a predictive model that identifies patients > 50 years old eligible for lung, breast and colorectal cancer screening who are at high-risk for missing these screenings; 2) to develop and pilot test a prototype shared decision-making support tool for patients and clinicians that will increase screening uptake; 3) to perform a pragmatic trial of the refined multilevel intervention that utilizes a shared decision-making support tool for patients and clinicians.  During the planning phase, data from the electronic health record (EHR) will be combined with supplementary data sources (e.g. Area Health Resource File, LexisNexis) to identify patients at risk of not completing recommended screening for these cancers. Hold-out cross-validation will be used to estimate model accuracy. Machine learning model building following feature selection will utilize logistic regression and decision trees to ensure the models are easily transferable to other healthcare settings and interpretable. This predictive model will be used to develop and pilot test an application that will (A) utilize predictive modeling to identify eligible patients likely to miss screening; (B) determine, after providing patient education, patient preferences and concerns regarding screening through self-report augmented by predictive modelling; (C) identify available community resources to facilitate screening; (D) provide this information to patients and to clinicians in the EHR prior to clinical visits to assist shared decision-making conversations and support active problem solving of identified barriers. This multilevel intervention will be pilot-tested and refined within 4 academic primary care practices over 6 months (N=24 clinicians; 8181 potential screenings yearly). A pragmatic trial will be conducted during the R33 phase using a stepped wedge cluster randomized design (N=45 clinicians; 11,239 potential screenings yearly). Completed cancer screening will be the primary outcome. Patient experience, clinician satisfaction and utilization will also be assessed. If successful, this approach will lead to an intervention tailored to the patient and their community that leverages information technology in a scalable way that is transferrable to other clinical settings and types of preventive services. PROJECT NARRATIVE Significant disparities exist in breast, colorectal and lung cancer, the leading causes of cancer mortality, requiring the development of new interventions that increase screening uptake in diverse populations. We propose an intervention that employs a multilevel approach that leverages the Electronic Health Records (EHR) and supplementary data sources to develop a predictive model to identify eligible patients at high-risk of not obtaining screening and to facilitate improved shared decision-making conversations using an EHR based decision-making support tool that interacts with patients and clinicians. By personalizing the approach to screening and improving the quality of patient-clinician interactions, we hope to enhance patient motivation to receive screening services and reduce health disparities.",Improving Cancer Screening Through A Tailored Technology-Based Intervention,10238833,R61AG068951,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communities ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' Decision Trees ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Ethnic People ', ' Ethnic Population ', ' Ethnicity People ', ' Ethnicity Population ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Health ', ' Health Resources ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' African American ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' Hispanics ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Rural Community ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' lung cancer ', ' satisfaction ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' uptake ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' CRC screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' detect colo-rectal cancer ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Visit ', ' preference ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Informatics ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Validation ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' electronic data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Preventive screening ', ' Preventative screening ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Information Technology ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' cancer type ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer-related health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' ethnoracial ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' pragmatic effectiveness trial ', ' shared decision making ', ' screening ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' socio-economic disparity ', ' model building ', ' support tools ', ' personalized approach ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' precision approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' Preventive service ', ' Preventative service ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' screening guidelines ', ' recommended screening ', ' screening recommendations ', ' regression trees ', ' feature selection ', ' screening services ', ' ']",NIA,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R61,2021,283016,SC-01
"Cardiovascular Health After Placental Abruption (CHAP) Abstract Placental abruption is an obstetrical complication defined as premature placental separation. Despite its elusive etiology, it is believed to be the consequence of acute stimuli – ischemia, inflammation, and oxidative stress at the maternal‐fetal interface – associated with rupture of the decidual artery, resulting in (premature) placental separation. The study of abruption and maternal and newborn long‐term cardiovascular and hemorrhagic/thrombotic cerebrovascular events is the central focus of the proposed project. We will examine the long‐term impact of abruption on rates of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality in women and in their children. We will also investigate the relationship of clinical classification (mild and severe forms) of abruption, risks based on abruption across successive pregnancies, and abruption in twin pregnancies, on rates of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. We will undertake a causal mediation analysis to evaluate the extent to which these associations may be mediated through (i) preterm delivery and (ii) small for gestational age births. We will perform this analysis by clinical classification of abruption and estimate the extent of mediation following corrections for both measured (socio‐demographic characteristics, including maternal smoking, comorbid medical conditions, and obstetrical events), and unmeasured confounding. A unique aspect of this project will be to identify, through applications of Support Vector Machines and Deep Learning algorithms, subsets of women at high risk for abruption and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity. Finally, we will examine whether maternal race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status are effect measure modifiers of the association between abruption and risks of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. We propose to address these aims through a large population‐based epidemiologic study, utilizing data from the Myocardial Infarction Data Acquisition System (MIDAS), a New Jersey statewide database of all patients admitted to all non‐federal acute care hospitals in NJ with a CVD diagnosis, with longitudinal follow‐up of up to 30 years. The MIDAS data will be linked to the NJ fetal death and linked live birth‐ infant death data with associated maternal and newborn hospitalization data between 1980‐2017 to create one of the largest and most comprehensive databases in the US to evaluate the extent to which sentinel events in pregnancy impart lasting risk for women's and children's health later in life. This project will provide unprecedented opportunities to address public health, policy implications and clinical screening recommendations of women during the period following delivery regarding risk susceptibility to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE) The overarching goal of this project is to examine the associations between placental abruption and risks of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality later in life. The project will focus on overall associations, as well as identifying subsets of women at high risk based on abruption severity, recurrent abruptions, gestational age at delivery, and fetal growth restriction. This project will provide unprecedented opportunities to address public health, and policy implications regarding women's health, and clinical screening recommendations of women during the period following delivery regarding risk susceptibility to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.",Cardiovascular Health After Placental Abruption (CHAP),10238171,R01HL150065,"['Abruptio Placentae ', ' Premature Separation of Placenta ', ' placental abruption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Arteries ', ' Attention ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cerebrovascular Disorders ', ' Brain Vascular Disorders ', ' Cerebrovascular Disease ', ' Intracranial Vascular Diseases ', ' Intracranial Vascular Disorders ', ' brain vascular disease ', ' brain vascular dysfunction ', ' cerebral vascular disease ', ' cerebral vascular dysfunction ', ' cerebrovascular dysfunction ', ' intracranial vascular dysfunction ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Cardiovascular Diagnostic Techniques ', ' Cardiovascular Diagnostic Technics ', ' cardiovascular disease diagnosis ', ' cardiovascular disorder diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Fetal Death ', ' fetus death ', ' Fetal Growth Retardation ', ' Fetal Growth Restriction ', ' IUGR ', ' Intrauterine Growth Retardation ', ' impaired fetal growth ', ' intra-uterine growth restriction ', ' intra-uterine growth retardation ', ' intrauterine growth restriction ', ' prenatal growth disorder ', ' Future ', ' Gestational Age ', ' Chronologic Fetal Maturity ', ' Fetal Age ', ' Goals ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Congestive Heart Failure ', ' Cardiac Failure Congestive ', ' Heart Decompensation ', ' chronic heart failure ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Infant Mortality ', ' Infant Mortality Total ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Newborns ', ' newborn child ', ' newborn children ', ' Small for Gestational Age Infant ', ' small for gestational age ', ' Inflammation ', ' Ischemia ', ' Maternal-Fetal Exchange ', ' Transplacental Exposure ', ' maternal-fetal interface ', ' Morbidity -

"SCH: INT: Computational Tools for Avoidaint/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder  Intellectual Merit: This project will for the first time provide the fundamental tools to integrate unique multimodal data toward screening, diagnosis, and intervention in eating disorders, with an initial focus on children with ARFID and related developmental and health disorders. This work is critical for enriching the understanding of healthy development and for broadening the foundations of behavioral data science. ARFID ·motivates the development of new computer vision and data analysis tools critical for the analysis of multidimensional behavioral data. The main aims are: 1. Develop and user individualized and integrated continuous facial affect coding from videos to discern affective motivations for food avoidance, critical due to the unique sensory aspects of eating disorders, and resulting from active stimulation via friendly and carefully designed images/videos and real food presentation; 2. Use data analysis and machine learning to derive sensory profiles based on patterns of food consumption and preference from existing unique datasets of selective eaters; and 3. Translate the tools developed in Aims 1 and 2 into the clinic and home to assess the capacity of these tools to define a threshold of clinically significant food avoidance, to detect change in acceptability of food with repeated presentations, and to examine and modify the accuracy of our food suggestion algorithms. Broader Impacts: The impact of this application comprises two broad domains. First is the derivation of processes, tools, and strategies to analyze very disparate data across multiple levels of analysis and to codify those strategies to inform similar future work, in particular incorporating automatic behavioral coding. Second is the exploitation of these tools to address questions about the emergence of healthy/unhealthy food selectivity across the lifespan, including recommendation delivery via apps and at-home recordings. The health impact of even partial success in this project is very broad and significant. Undergraduate students will be involved in this project via the 6-weeks summer research program at the Information Initiative at Duke, a center dedicated to the fundamentals of data science and its applications; via the co-Pl's research lab devoted to eating disorders; and via the Pl's project dedicated to training undergraduate students to address eating disorders of their friends via an anonymous app. Outreach and dissemination will follow the broad use of the developed app, both in the clinic and the general population, including the Pl's connections with low-income and under-represented bi-lingual preK. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Eating disorders are potentially life-threatening mental illnesses affecting the general population; -90% of individuals never receive treatment, in part due to lack of awareness and access. Individuals with eating disorders experience a diminished quality of life, high mental and physical illness comorbidities, and an existence marked by profound loneliness and isolation. Combining expertise in eating disorders with computer vision and machine learning, we bring for the first time data science to this health challenge.

"Outcome-driven Order Set Content Development, Management, and Evaluation Project Summary Candidate Goals and Objectives: With a background in Information Systems and Management, and Biostatistics, Dr. Zhang has demonstrated research records on electronic health record data mining to identify patterns of healthcare delivery that may be used to inform patient-centered and evidence-based healthcare. The proposal will provide additional training for Dr. Zhang on advanced machine learning, statistics, and evaluation methods in biomedical informatics for applications on clinical decision support (CDS). Dr. Zhang's long-term goal is to bringing innovation CDS development and evaluation through novel biomedical informatics and data science techniques. Institutional Environment and Career Development: Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM) provides ideal research facilities and training environment for Dr. Zhang. Dr. Jyotishman Pathak, Chief of Division of Health Informatics at Department of Health Policy and Research, will lead a multidisciplinary team of mentors: Drs. Jessica Ancker and Fei Wang at WCM, and Dr. Adam Wright at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Zhang also has collaborators in WCM and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital who will support her in her training and research activities and provide clinical expertise. Research Aims Order sets are a type of CDS in computerized provider order entry (CPOE) to standardize decision making in the ordering process and encourage compliance with clinical practice guidelines. Previous literature on order set use has focused its effect on usability, workload, and physician satisfaction, but a knowledge gap remains with respect to the effect of order sets on care outcomes. The overall goal of the research study is to create a continuous improvement cycle for order sets with respect to a care outcome by rigorously learning from data. Aim 1 of the study will apply computational phenotyping and subtyping algorithms to identify cohorts of heart failure (HF) subtypes. Aim 2 will evaluate an existing order set intended for the care of HF patients on a care outcome defined as 30-day all-cause, unplanned readmission with a hypothesis that the use of this order set is associated with a better outcome. This will be achieved by building a range of outcome prediction models and evaluating the strength of each order set order as a predictor. Aim 3 will optimize the existing order sets using a metaheuristic optimization method such that its content collectively may have the largest positive effect on the outcome of 30-day all-cause unplanned readmission. The effects of order set use on the care outcome is measured using a causal inference technique in each iteration. The expected outcome is a framework to develop and evaluate HF order sets which may eventually be generalized to other clinical areas. Training from this proposal may lead to multi-site R01 studies of outcome-driven HF order sets and actual implementations. Project Narrative In this study, we propose a continuous improvement cycle to develop, manage, and evaluate outcome-driven order sets, a type of clinical decision support (CDS) for computerized provider order entry (CPOE). Mentorship and training include advanced statistics, machine learning, and evaluation methods in biomedical informatics. The proposed research will leverage the principal investigator (PI)'s background in methodology development and health information systems to provide the PI with additional training to innovate outcome-driven CDS for CPOE.","Outcome-driven Order Set Content Development, Management, and Evaluation",10242838,K01LM013257,"['Algorithms ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Decision Making ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health delivery systems ', ' health services delivery ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Information Management ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environment ', ' Goals ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Judgment ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Management Information Systems ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Structural Models ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Standardization ', ' statistics ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Workload ', ' Work Load ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' satisfaction ', ' Research Activity ', ' Clinical Practice Guideline ', ' Clinical Pathways ', ' Presbyterians ', ' Presbyterian Church ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Outcome Study ', ' health care organization ', ' healthcare organization ', ' healthcare service organization ', ' health care service organization ', ' success ', ' research facility ', ' cohort ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' novel ', ' Health Information System ', ' research study ', ' validation studies ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Health Informatics ', ' consumer informatics ', ' Public Health Informatics ', ' Provider ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Policy Research ', ' Research Training ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' biomed informatics ', ' inpatient service ', ' inpatient care ', ' computerized ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' computerized physician order entry ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' usability ', ' demographics ', ' evidence base ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' social health determinants ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' Data Science ', ' individual patient ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' improved outcome ', ' personalized decision ', ' individualized clinical decision ', ' individualized decision ', ' personalized clinical decision ', ' personalized data-driven decision ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' care outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' clinical decision support ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' random forest ', ' long short term memory ', ' neural network algorithm ', ' multilayer perceptron ', ' phenotyping algorithm ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' implementation study ', ' ']",NLM,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,K01,2021,176379,NY-12
"Using deep brain stimulation of the parietal cortex to investigate the electrophysiology of human episodic memory Project Summary Our proposal seeks to build upon the success of our lab investigating the electrophysiology of human memory through novel experiments that will elucidate hippocampal—parietal interactions in memory processing. The key innovations of this proposal are the application of direct brain stimulation to the mesial parietal cortex and the adaptation of an associative recognition paradigm to intracranial data. We will take advantage of our high-volume epilepsy surgical center specializing in stereo EEG electrode implantation. In our first aim, we will compare how electrophysiological patterns of brain activation differ between free recall (which comprises the bulk of intracranial memory data) and associative recognition, specifically examining properties of theta oscillations in the anterior versus posterior hippocampus. In the second aim, we will apply deep brain stimulation to the mesial parietal cortex during memory encoding and retrieval, observing differences in memory performance and hippocampal oscillatory activity that will inform hypotheses of how this area supports episodic memory. In Aim 3, we will use machine learning classifiers to understand how mesial parietal stimulation affects memory performance via its impact on brain oscillatory activity in a responsive stimulation paradigm. These experiments will utilize our lab’s knowledge and infrastructure gained through participation in the DARPA Restoring Active Memory project. While our proposal is highly innovative, our center’s proven success in recruiting a large volume of stereo EEG patients for memory research, data collection, and the application of advanced analytic techniques give us confidence that we will collect high quality data addressing the critical gaps in the understanding of human memory. Project Narrative Two critical gaps in our understanding of human memory are whether or not hippocampal theta oscillations support encoding in the same manner as in rodents, and the contribution of the mesial parietal cortex in encoding versus retrieval. These questions are closely linked together, and we propose to study them in stereo EEG patients using a novel memory paradigm coupled with deep brain stimulation. Our planned experiments include a closed-loop stimulation paradigm seeking to use parietal stimulation to improve memory performance, the results of which will both inform theories of human episodic memory processing and of the design of therapeutic brain stimulation devices to treat cognitive deficits.",Using deep brain stimulation of the parietal cortex to investigate the electrophysiology of human episodic memory,10448827,R01NS107357,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Anterior ', ' Area ', ' Animal Experiments ', ' Link ', ' analog ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Attenuated ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Deep Brain Stimulation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Parietal ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' memory recognition ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Episodic memory ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' memory processing ', ' memory process ', ' memory retrieval ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' memory decline ', ' Memory Loss ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' Brain region ', ' Effectiveness ', ' degenerative condition ', ' degenerative disease ', ' Degenerative Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Retrieval ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' direct application ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' implantation ', ' human disease ', ' memory encoding ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic strategies ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' human imaging ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', ' advanced analytics ', ' learning classifier ', ' ']",NINDS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,79977,TX-30
"CoAI: Cost-Aware Artificial Intelligence for Efficient Prehospital Diagnosis of Trauma Patients Project Summary/Abstract While artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are becoming widely used throughout medicine, the analysis of the cost of an ML model’s predictions has been very limited. For example, an ML model may accurately predict that a trauma patient will have acute traumatic coagulopathy (ATC), a bleeding disorder; however, it may heavily rely on hard-to-measure patient features, like blood pressure or Glasgow Coma Score, to do so. Standard ML techniques do not prioritize timely diagnosis, which is key to minimize death and injury. This idea, which we refer to as cost-aware prediction, is a topic of recent interest in machine learning. However, existing methods have substantial limitations, and their clinical impact has not been demonstrated. This proposal will adopt recent advances in ML and explainable AI to 1) develop improved cost-aware prediction techniques. 2) demonstrate their value using clinical data and 3) integrate them into the electronic medical record. These methods will be applicable in many areas of science and medicine. Aim 1. Develop a novel feature importance-based approach for cost-aware prediction. No existing approach for cost-aware prediction consistently outperforms the others, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. This proposal uses recent discoveries in machine learning to design a new algorithm, CoAI, with new strengths and fewer weaknesses. CoAI will substantially improve predictive performance, enable analysis on large datasets, and flexibly work with any ML model. Preliminary results show that CoAI can outperform existing methods. A new public benchmark for cost-aware prediction will be created and used to compare CoAI to existing methods, and CoAI will be published as easy-to-use open-source software. Aim 2. Evaluate CoAI’s potential for clinical time savings. CoAI’s ability to predict bleeding disorders will be tested on an unprecedentedly detailed dataset that combines trauma hospital data with surveys of doctors and paramedics. Comparing CoAI to the risk scores used in clinical practice will provide explicit estimates of how much time CoAI can save and how many misdiagnoses it can prevent. In preliminary analysis with trauma registry data, CoAI reduces prediction time and increases accuracy relative to an existing risk score. Aim 3. Incorporate an interactive ML method into the medical record. CoAI will be integrated into the electronic medical record (EMR), using feedback from professional paramedics. Quantitative estimates of time and cost savings and subjective impressions will be gathered from paramedics, and open-ended interviews will be conducted to assess their feelings about interactive machine learning methods like CoAI. These insights will guide future research in interactive machine learning methods, as well as possible clinical work to study CoAI’s impact on decision making in simulated trauma scenarios.  Successful completion of this project will allow faster, more accurate diagnosis of acute illness and advance the state of the art in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Project Narrative Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly becoming an integral part of healthcare, from automatic radiology reading and triage to early-warning systems that detect adverse events during surgery. Until recently, AI systems have not been optimized to rely on data that can be gathered quickly or easily. We believe developing AI systems that can intelligently minimize the cost their use imposes on health care providers will lead to more efficient patient risk prediction and diagnosis, and will ultimately save lives.",CoAI: Cost-Aware Artificial Intelligence for Efficient Prehospital Diagnosis of Trauma Patients,10440236,F30HL151074,"['Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Awareness ', ' Blood Coagulation Disorders ', ' Coagulation Disorder ', ' Coagulopathy ', ' bleeding disorder ', ' clotting disorder ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Budgets ', ' Coma ', ' Comatose ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' assess cost ', ' cost assessment ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Decision Trees ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Hospitals ', ' Intelligence ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Medical Records ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Paramedical Personnel ', ' Paramedic ', ' Patients ', ' Publishing ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Reading ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Savings ', ' Science ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Triage ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' Cost Savings ', ' falls ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Adopted ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' impression ', ' Performance ', ' computer science ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' patient registry ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Process ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' cost ', ' time use ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Trauma ', ' open source ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' clinical practice ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' data registry ', ' Trauma patient ', ' Patient risk ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' trauma induced coagulopathy ', ' traumatic coagulopathy ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,F30,2021,51036,WA-07
"NorthStar Node of the Clinical Trials Network In CTN-0076-Ot (Clinical Decision Support for Opioid Use Disorders in Medical Settings: Pilot Usability Testing in an EMR (COMPUTE)), our team iteratively developed and piloted a web-based and electronic health record (EHR)-integrated Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) Clinical Decision Support (CDS) system to offer expert guidance to primary care providers (PCPs) on the diagnosis and management of OUD. The OUD-CDS, referred to as Opioid Wizard, was implemented within the EPIC EHR of one large care system and piloted with 55 providers to ensure content validity and provider satisfaction. Through CTN-0095 (COMPUTE 2.0), our team will now implement Opioid Wizard in a large multi-site clinic-randomized controlled trial to evaluate its impact on practice process measures and patient outcomes. We also aim to prepare for scalability (i.e., integration into usual primary care practice after the study is complete) and dissemination by evaluating facilitators and barriers to implementation, determining the costs of implementation and maintenance, and assessing the short-term cost impacts of Opioid Wizard.  The study will include three large diverse care systems and randomize a minimum of 30 clinics to receive Opioid Wizard or usual care (UC). In intervention clinics, Opioid Wizard will identify patients who are at high risk` for OUD or diagnosed with OUD; use data stored in the EHR for each eligible patient to assemble treatment recommendations tailored to each patient’s current needs; display these recommendations to PCPs via the Opioid Wizard user interface; and store analytic data from all targeted visits. In UC clinics, Opioid Wizard will run invisibly in the background to identify high-risk or OUD patients, assemble treatment recommendations tailored to each eligible patient’s needs, and store analytic data from all targeted visits. This study is part of the NIH’s Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative to speed scientific solutions to the national opioid public health crisis. The NIH HEAL Initiative bolsters research across NIH to improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction. There is a nearly 80% treatment gap in the use of medications to treat opioid use disorder (MOUD). Conducting a large-scale trial of Opioid Wizard, an opioid use disorder clinical decision support system for primary care settings, has great potential to increase access to MOUD, and could help reduce the nearly $20 billion in annual healthcare costs related to untreated opioid misuse and OUD.",NorthStar Node of the Clinical Trials Network,10379705,UG1DA040316,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ',

"The Ohio Valley Node of the Clinical Trials Network Project Summary (Abstract): Since its establishment in 2000, the Ohio Valley Node (OVN) has been one of the most productive of NIDA's Clinical Trials Network (CTN) nodes, both in leading and participating in multi-site trials. The OVN includes successful partnerships with four healthcare systems, two pharmacy networks, and six addiction specialty/ infectious disease programs. These collaborating sites span a seven-state region including some of the states most heavily impacted by opioid (Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia) and methamphetamine (Missouri, Kentucky, and North Dakota) use. The OVN includes Midwestern, Appalachian, Upper South, and Native American representation, which significantly enhances the geographical and cultural diversity of the CTN. The OVN Research Core is the driving force of the OVN and is led by Dr. Winhusen, one of the foremost experts in conducting multi-site addiction clinical trials in clinical practice settings. The OVN investigators have extensive expertise in substance use disorders (Winhusen, Brown, Burlew, Lyons, Montgomery, Lofwall, Walsh) and bioinformatics (Kaelber, Xu). The six members of the OVN research-implementation team bring > 60 years of combined experience conducting CTN clinical trials. If funded, our overall goal would be to utilize the wealth of experience and expertise gained over the past 19 years to conduct the research needed to address public health care crises, including the opioid use epidemic and the alarming increase in stimulant use. To this end, we would work with our healthcare partners to engage a diverse set of patients and service systems in areas highly impacted by substance use in CTN research. We would also contribute our expertise in conducting efficacy, effectiveness, and implementation trials testing the full range of interventions, from medications to behavioral interventions and health service innovations, for both opioid and stimulant use disorders. Moreover, we would contribute our expertise in the use of electronic health records for prospective and retrospective research studies, including the application of artificial intelligence to large healthcare datasets. In sum, we seek to continue providing scientific leadership, particularly on studies that could meaningfully impact clinical practice, and to effectively collaborate with a variety of professionals including treatment providers, investigators from diverse institutions, and staff of the Center for CTN (CCTN), clinical coordinating center (CCC) and data and statistics center (DSC) in support of the CTN mission.

"Improving the usage and impact of the Integrated Aging Studies Databank and Registry Project Summary The Integrated Aging Studies Databank and Registry (IASDR) is a repository designed for sharing data across the NIH-funded national network of Older Americans Independence Centers (OAICs). The IASDR hosted and maintained by the OAIC’s Coordinating Center (CC). As a domain-specific repository, the existing IASDR contains multiple data sets generated from aging studies conducted at the Wake Forest OAIC (WF-OAIC), as well as a biospecimen bank for samples collected from some of the included studies. The IASDR thus serves as a valuable resource for the aging research community, especially for early career faculty. The data repository befits early career investigators who want to conduct small pilot studies for testing out conjectures and research hypotheses, and to efficiently produce useful information such as preliminary effect sizes for grant applications or to power future studies. Gaps were identified when the IASDR was evaluated against modern repository requirements. The IASDR was first started more than a decade ago, and the development process did not necessarily strictly adhere to contemporary biomedical-data repository principles such as the FAIR and TRUST principles. Importantly, barriers are present for users in accessing key information for decision support. For example, currently summary statistics such as mean, standard deviation, frequency for variables and association information between variables, which are often critical in helping users to decide whether or not to pursue actual data, are not present in the IASDR metadata. The lack of such preliminary information could deter interested users from using the repository. To address gaps and limitations of the IASDR as related to its “FAIR”-ness and “TRUST”- worthiness, this proposal contains two specific aims: (1) Enhance the metadata layer by providing users with key analytic information such as mean, frequency, and association between variables, and (2) improve the IASDR along the FAIR and TRUST principles and seek certification. Project Narrative The proposed project improves an existing data repository, the Integrated Aging Studies Databank and Registry (IASDR), which contains both data and biospecimen from multiple aging studies, along principles for modern data repository. The improvement will increase usability and confidence of the aging research user community.",Improving the usage and impact of the Integrated Aging Studies Databank and Registry,10408207,U24AG059624,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Capsicum ', ' pepper ', ' Certification ', ' Communities ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Modernization ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Paper ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality Control ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' forest ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Gerontology ', ' biogerontology ', ' Biological Specimen Banks ', ' Biological Substance Banks ', ' biological specimen repository ', ' biosample repository ', ' biospecimen bank ', ' biospecimen repository ', ' specimen bank ', ' specimen repository ', ' Link ', ' Visual ', ' Trust ', ' Fostering ', ' Licensing ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Frequencies ', ' Physical Function ', ' interest ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' American ', ' computer center ', ' experience ', ' synergism ', ' Structure ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Sampling ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Update ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' study characteristics ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' interoperability ', ' usability ', ' data sharing ', ' early-career faculty ', ' data access ', ' FAIR principles ', ' FAIR data ', ' FAIR guiding principles ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable ', ' Infrastructure ', ' multiple datasets ', ' multiple data sets ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' data repository ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' TRUST principles ', ' Transparency, Responsibility, User focus, Sustainability, and Technology ', ' ']",NIA,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U24,2021,232275,NC-06

"Application of a Machine Learning to Enhance e-Triggers to Detect and Learn from Diagnostic Safety Events The frequency of diagnostic errors in emergency departments (ED) is largely unknown but likely to be significant. There is a compelling need to create measurement methods that provide diagnostic safety data to clinicians and leaders who in turn can act upon these data to prevent diagnostic harm. Electronic trigger (e- trigger) tools mine vast amounts of clinical and administrative data to identify signals for likely adverse events and have demonstrated capability to identify diagnostic errors. Such tools are more efficient and effective than other methods and can reduce the number of records requiring human review to those at highest risk of harm.  In prior work, we used rules-based e-trigger algorithms to identify patterns of care suggestive of missed or delayed diagnoses in primary care and inpatient settings. For instance, a clinic visit followed several days later by an unplanned hospitalization could be indicative of potential problems with the diagnostic process at the clinic visit. We also proposed a knowledge discovery framework, the Safer Dx Trigger Tools Framework, to enable health care organizations (HCOs) to develop and implement e-trigger tools to measure diagnostic errors using comprehensive electronic health record (EHR) data. Review and analysis of these cases can uncover safety concerns and provide information on diagnostic process breakdowns and related contributory factors, which in turn could generate learning and feedback for improvement purposes.  Sophisticated techniques from machine learning (ML) and data science could help inform ‘second generation’ e-trigger algorithms that better identify diagnostic errors and/or harm than rules-based e-triggers that require substantial manual effort and chart reviews. In contrast to rules-based systems, ML techniques could help learn from examples and accurately retrieve charts with diagnostic error without the need for “hand crafting” of an e-trigger. We will apply e-triggers to comprehensive EHRs that contain longitudinal patient care data (progress notes, tests, referrals) that provide an extensive picture of patients’ diagnostic journeys. Using national VA data, including data from 9 million veterans, and data from Geisinger health system, a pioneer HCO that serves approximately 3 million patients, we propose the following aims: Aim 1 – To develop, refine, test, and apply Safer Dx e-triggers to enable detection, measurement, and learning from diagnostic errors in diverse emergency department (ED) settings. We will calculate the frequency of diagnostic errors in the ED based on these e-triggers and describe the burden of preventable diagnostic harm. Aim 2 - To explore machine learning techniques that yield robust, accurate models to predict diagnostic errors using EHR-enriched data derived from expert-labeled patient records containing diagnostic errors (from Aim 1).  To our knowledge this is the first ML application in diagnostic error measurement, which could help scale up expert-driven e-trigger development and refinement. Newly developed e-triggers can be pilot tested and implemented at other HCOs, enabling them to create actionable safety-related insights from digital data. Narrative The process of making a diagnosis in emergency departments can be vulnerable to error. To study the risks involved, we will develop strategies to better identify electronic medical records of patients who may have had a diagnostic error in their care. We will test the use of human-derived rule-based algorithms and data-driven machine learning methods that can more accurately and efficiently identify these medical records than other currently available methods used in measurement of patient safety.",Application of a Machine Learning to Enhance e-Triggers to Detect and Learn from Diagnostic Safety Events,10254269,R01HS027363,[''],AHRQ,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,500000,TX-09
"Multicenter Study of the Emergency Department Trigger Tool Existing methods for surveillance of patient harm in the ED setting are inadequate, without any meaningful change in decades. Trigger tools, popularized by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement’s Global Trigger Tool, have been developed for multiple clinical areas and are used across the world, outperform traditional approaches for surveillance of adverse events. These tools use a two-tiered review process where a nurse screens records for triggers (predefined findings that make the presence of an AE more likely) and reviews records with triggers for AEs, discarding those without triggers. We developed a consensus-based ED trigger tool (EDTT) using a multicenter, transdisciplinary modified Delphi approach, subsequently pilot testing this in a multicenter fashion with encouraging results. This was followed by a recently completed, AHRQ-funded single center study to automate, refine and validate this tool. This study demonstrated that the EDTT is a high-yield and efficient instrument for identifying adverse events in the ED. The present study will evaluate the refined, automated EDTT), in a multicenter study. We will evaluate the EDTT’s generalizability and robustness at three sites with large emergency departments, with a planned in-depth review of 9,000 ED admissions. We will use natural language processing of electronic medical record narratives and machine learning to improve the EDTT efficiency in trigger detection and AE discovery. We will establish the basis for a wider use and prepare for scalability and usability of the tool, creating standardized, streamlined and free online training materials, and by evaluating the tool in a real-world manner consistent with intended use. Project Narrative Commonly used approaches in Emergency Departments to detect adverse events are low yield and have not changed in decades, providing inadequate surveillance for patient harm. The need for improved methodology is critical, given the evolving role of the emergency department in the health care system. Trigger tools, developed for use in many healthcare settings across the world, detect all-cause harm, helping direct resources by identifying areas of risk and allowing an assessment of the effectiveness of quality improvement efforts over time. Trigger tools involve screening of records by a nurse for triggers (findings that make an adverse event more likely) and a review of only records with triggers searching for adverse events. Any events identified undergo confirmatory physician review. We developed a trigger tool for the ED, applying rigorous methods to identify predictive triggers, to computerize the screen for triggers eliminating manual review and improving record selection to enhance yield and efficiency. This tool demonstrates superior performance for detecting adverse events. We will now test this tool in a multicenter project to evaluate its broad application, confirming its utility and to continue to improve its yield and efficiency in adverse event detection by applying natural language processing and machine learning techniques.",Multicenter Study of the Emergency Department Trigger Tool,10265522,R01HS027811,[''],AHRQ,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,386126,MO-01
"Development of an adaptive machine learning platform for automated analysis of biomarkers in biomedical images ABSTRACT Manual analysis of biomedical images by researchers and pathologists is time intensive, requires intensive training, and prone to introduce bias and error. Optical analysis of targets within tissue samples, cultures, or specimens is fundamental to detecting biological properties, including protein interaction within the central nervous system, sperm counts, digestive-system parasites, and immune response to viral infections like COVID-19. Unintentional bias and attentional limitations during analysis of biomarkers can underlie poor reproducibility of findings in biomedical research and potentially introduce errors to clinical diagnostics. These problems are significant barriers to delivering the most beneficial evidence-based medicine, developing effective medical treatments, and promoting public confidence in scientific inquiry. Application of computer vision for cellular target detection is a promising approach to reducing human bias, subjectivity, and errors that limit the reproducibility of research and slow the development of effective medical treatments. Our image analysis software, called Pipsqueak AITM, and the underlying artificial intelligence (AI) technology developed during our NIH SBIR Phase I award, have significantly increased inter- and intra-rater reliability of tissue sample analysis and decreased analysis time for multiplexed biomarkers. Pipsqueak AI is available now as an integration to ImageJ/FIJI (https://Pipsqueak.ai), and is capable of returning hundreds of accurate cellular target detections to the user within 300ms of image upload. During the last 6 months, Pipsqueak usership has exploded to over 1000 active monthly users, indicating high demand for computer vision technologies that improve the speed and accuracy of micrograph quantification. Our pre-trained ML models are capable of detecting multiple cellular morphologies and target types with precision and reproducibility that greatly exceed human analysis. Here, we propose to develop a pre-trained biomedical image analysis platform that rapidly and accurately identifies diverse cellular targets, and make this technology commercially available as a cloud computer vision service, called Sightologist.aiTM. Our computer vision AI-as-a-service (AIaaS) will be made available to research and clinical end-users through our Pipsqueak AI software and through 3rd party product integrations. To achieve these goals, we will build on our SBIR Phase I progress that developed ML models for biomarker detection, and implement cloud distribution methods to deliver our computer vision service to remote users and applications. PROJECT NARRATIVE Manual analysis of biomedical images by researchers and pathologists has the potential to introduce bias and error that compromise the reliability of research and clinical findings; problems which are significant barriers to delivering the most beneficial evidence-based medicine and developing effective medical treatments, including determining sperm counts, detecting diseases, and testing for immune response to viral infections like COVID- 19.

"Automating mosquito microdissection for a malaria PfSPZ vaccine ABSTRACT Despite annual investments of >$3 billion for intensive control measures, in 2018, the 228 million cases of malaria were an increase of ~16 million cases over 2015, and no decrease in number of deaths. The impact of available malaria control measure has plateaued. Moreover, WHO estimates deaths from malaria could double across sub-Saharan Africa this year due to disruptions in access to control measures due to the current global COVID-19 pandemic malaria. New tools, especially a vaccine, are needed. Only broad deployment of an effective vaccine holds the promise of true elimination or eradication, especially in the face of sudden developments like COVID-19. More than 98% of all deaths from malaria are caused by Plasmodium falciparum (Pf). Thus, a vaccine against Pf malaria is the priority. Sanaria is moving in 2021 to Phase 3 clinical trials of its Pf sporozoite (SPZ), PfSPZ Vaccine, and is planning for marketing authorization (licensure) from FDA and EMA in 2022/2023. Over the next 5-10 years we aim to decrease the cost of goods (COGs) and efficiency of production of PfSPZ vaccines so they can be used most effectively and economically by individuals who suffer the most from malaria. Microdissection of mosquitoes is a crucial step in extraction of PfSPZ vaccine products, and ensures a 10,000-fold purification away from irrelevant mosquito parts as the starting material for downstream purification procedures that then achieve a final product purity of 99.9%. To-date, mosquito salivary gland PfSPZ have demonstrated in vivo infectivity/potency superior to those extracted from whole mosquitoes, or grown outside a mosquito. However, extraction of mosquito salivary glands is a rate-limiting, labor-intensive, expensive step in production of PfSPZ-based vaccines. The overarching aim of this proposal is to enable implementation of an interim semi-automated dissection device in cGMP production of PfSPZ-based vaccines against malaria, and develop an integrated dissection system incorporating multiple automation steps downstream of mosquito orientation, for commercial-scale manufacturing. The unique application of robotic technology, state-of-the art computer vision and machine learning algorithms, and software systems to production-scale processing of very small insects in cleanrooms not only advances manufacturing capabilities, but also represents a spectrum of milestone innovations in automation. Success in this project involving a highly-skilled multi-disciplinary team of investigators, manufacturing and quality experts will decidedly lead to further streamlining and process optimization during the key step of isolating mosquito salivary glands for manufacture of our highly effective PfSPZ-based vaccines. The breakthroughs that initially defined a vaccine that is far superior to competing technologies in both safety and protective efficacy, will continue, as we advance in the proposed studies to make vaccine extraction more cost-effective due to greater efficiencies, mitigation of human error and operator fatigue, reduced timeframes, greatly reduced training periods, and increased product purity, towards deployment of a highly-impactful tool in the fight against malaria. Malaria claims upwards of 600,000 human lives each year, with more than 1,000 children succumbing every day. Sanaria’s Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) sporozoite (SPZ)-based vaccines against malaria have demonstrated outstanding safety and efficacy in numerous clinical trials. The manufacturing procedure for PfSPZ-based crucially involves a currently labor-intensive process of mosquito salivary gland extraction entirely by manual dissection. Our aim in this proposal is to first introduce an interim semi-automated dissection fixture for this process. In parallel efforts, incorporating automation in key steps of mosquito decapitation, and extraction of glands will lead to greater efficiencies, reduce timeframes, greatly reduce training times, mitigate human error and operator fatigue while maintaining product purity and quality that is thought to underlie an incredible safety record of Sanaria’s PfSPZ vaccines. These outcomes will accelerate Sanaria’s march to licensure and production of commercial-scale volumes required to meet demand for post-licensure distribution to populations with greatest need, world- wide.",Automating mosquito microdissection for a malaria PfSPZ vaccine,10258416,R44AI134500,"['Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Automation ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Dissection ', ' Environment ', ' Equipment ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Goals ', ' Cyclic GMP ', ' Guanosine Cyclic Monophosphate ', ' cGMP ', ' Head ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Insecta ', ' Insects ', ' Insects Invertebrates ', ' Investments ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Licensure ', ' Malaria ', ' Paludism ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Falciparum Malaria ', ' Plasmodium falciparum Malaria ', ' Manuals ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Culicidae ', ' Mosquitoes ', ' Needles ', ' Plasmodium falciparum ', ' P falciparum ', ' P. falciparum ', ' P.falciparum ', ' Production ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Robotics ', ' Running ', ' Safety ', ' Salivary Glands ', ' Salivary Glands Head and Neck ', ' Stainless Steel ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vaccines ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Measures ', ' Decapitation ', ' base ', ' Microscope ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Phase ', ' Malaria Vaccines ', ' Malarial Vaccines ', ' vaccines against malaria ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Body part ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Phase III Clinical Trials ', ' Phase 3 Clinical Trials ', ' phase III protocol ', ' tool ', ' Filamentous Fungi ', ' Molds ', ' Combs ', ' Comb animal structure ', ' Hour ', ' System ', ' Sporozoites ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Microdissection ', ' Devices ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' Thorace ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorax ', ' Chest ', ' Modeling ', ' Gland ', ' in vivo ', ' Collection ', ' Scheme ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Authorization documentation ', ' Authorization ', ' Permission ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' fight against ', ' feeding ', ' software systems ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Plasmodium falciparum vaccine ', ' PfSPZ Vaccine ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' cGMP production ', ' protective efficacy ', ' process optimization ', ' manufacturing scale-up ', ' operation ', ' Geometry ', ' Injections ', ' human error ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' robotic system ', ' COVID-19 ', ' COVID19 ', ' CV-19 ', ' CV19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' COVID-19 pandemic ', ' COVID crisis ', ' COVID epidemic ', ' COVID pandemic ', ' COVID-19 crisis ', ' COVID-19 epidemic ', ' COVID-19 global health crisis ', ' COVID-19 global pandemic ', ' COVID-19 health crisis ', ' COVID-19 public health crisis ', ' COVID19 crisis ', ' COVID19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 global health crisis ', ' COVID19 global pandemic ', ' COVID19 health crisis ', ' COVID19 pandemic ', ' COVID19 public health crisis ', ' SARS-CoV-2 epidemic ', ' SARS-CoV-2 global health crisis ', ' SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic ', ' SARS-CoV-2 pandemic ', ' SARS-CoV2 epidemic ', ' SARS-CoV2 pandemic ', ' SARS-coronavirus-2 epidemic ', ' SARS-coronavirus-2 pandemic ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 epidemic ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 pandemic ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 epidemic ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 crisis ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 global health crisis ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 global pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 health crisis ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 public health crisis ', ' coronavirus disease crisis ', ' coronavirus disease epidemic ', ' coronavirus disease pandemic ', ' severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 global health crisis ', ' severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 global pandemic ', ' ']",NIAID,"SANARIA, INC.",R44,2021,1000000,MD-06
"PRECISE - a PErsonalized Risk Score for gastrIc CancEr The National Cancer Institute has called for eliminating disparities in cancer morbidity and mortality through the use of Data Science. Gastric cancer remains one of the most unequally distributed cancers in the United States, with high burden among certain ethnic, racial, and immigrant groups. Identification of individuals at greatest risk for gastric cancer may allow for targeted risk attenuation programs, and improve health equity. Candidate and Career Development Plan: I am a board-certified Gastroenterologist and Master’s degree-trained epidemiologist at Stanford University who seeks to use data science to reduce disparities in cancer outcomes. Based on my training and experience, I have content expertise in gastrointestinal cancer diagnosis, and methodologic expertise in epidemiologic principles and observational study design. In order to achieve my long-term goal of becoming an independent investigator and national leader in cancer disparities research, I require additional quantitative skills (large data analytics, machine learning-based risk prediction, unstructured data extraction using natural language processing), qualitative skills (effective scientific communication, scientific leadership), and professional development. Research Plan: The overarching research aim of this proposal is to develop a PErsonalized Risk Score for gastrIc CancEr (PRECISE) using real-world clinical data sources. My overall hypothesis is that through use of advanced data analytics and deep learning methods, a highly-refined cohort of individuals at highest risk for gastric cancer can be identified. The Specific Aims of this proposal seek to address this hypothesis: (1) to build a personalized risk prediction model using regression, (2) to build a personalized risk prediction model using machine learning algorithms, and (3) to compare regression and machine learning models in electronic health records data. Achievement of these aims will produce a novel, personalized prediction score which will help identify individuals at high risk for gastric cancer and who may benefit from targeted risk attenuation programs. Mentorship Team: To achieve these Aims, I have assembled a world class mentorship team with expertise in epidemiology and health disparities research (Latha Palaniappan, primary mentor), machine learning and natural language processing in EHR data (Tina Hernandez-Boussard, co-mentor), and gastric cancer screening and prevention (Joo Ha Hwang, co-mentor).

"Predictive Analytics in Hemodialysis: Enabling Precision Care for Patient with ESKD ABSTRACT End stage kidney disease (ESKD) is a complex disease with individuals having variable life- expectancies, with 25% dying within 1 year and 41% surviving at least 5 years. While providers recognize that patients are different – and ought to be differently – there are no tools to reliably forecast individual life expectancy and aid in treatment individualization. Instead, providers are left with often unclear or incomplete guidelines on how best to manage patients. In order to provide precision care for patients on hemodialysis (HD), there is a critical need to be able to (1) dynamically assess life expectancy for medical decision-making; and (2) identify distinct clinical phenotypes to enhance clinical monitoring and care planning. Our central hypothesis is that there is heterogeneity in patient survivorship and disease trajectory that, when known, can be used to provide more personalized and effective care. By coupling novel machine learning approaches for survival prediction with granular clinical data on HD patients, we will be able to develop the analytic tools necessary to support precision care. At the completion of this proposal we will have tools to dynamically assess a patient's life expectancy and insights into heterogeneous disease phenotypes for patients with ESKD. These tools will allow providers to make informed treatment decisions as well as lay the groundwork for further precision research into optimized patient care. NARRATIVE End stage kidney disease (ESKD) is a complex disease with individuals having variable life- expectancies. However, there are no tools to reliably forecast individual life expectancy. In this proposal we will develop an analytic framework for predicting patient life-expectancy allowing for the personalized study and and ultimately treatment of individuals with ESKD.",Predictive Analytics in Hemodialysis: Enabling Precision Care for Patient with ESKD,10192714,R01DK123062,"['Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Dialysis ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Health ', ' Hemodialysis ', ' Hemodialyses ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Hypotension ', ' Low Blood Pressure ', ' Vascular Hypotensive Disorder ', ' Infection ', ' Laboratories ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Supervision ', ' survivorship ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Weight Gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' wt gain ', ' Work ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Caring ', ' Malnutrition ', ' Nutritional Deficiency ', ' Undernutrition ', ' dietary deficiency ', ' malnourished ', ' nutrition deficiency ', ' nutrition deficiency disorder ', ' nutritional deficiency disorder ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Left ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Quality-of-Life Assessment ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Companions ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Modeling ', ' Provider ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Cardiac ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' disease phenotype ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Coupled ', ' Coupling ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' analytical tool ', ' usability ', ' clinical care ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' personalized care ', ' Precision care ', ' individualized care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' individual patient ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative care ', ' personalized decision ', ' individualized clinical decision ', ' individualized decision ', ' personalized clinical decision ', ' personalized data-driven decision ', ' predictive tools ', ' associated symptom ', ' co-morbid symptom ', ' co-occuring symptom ', ' comorbid symptom ', ' concurrent symptom ', ' cooccuring symptom ', ' symptom association ', ' symptom comorbidity ', ' survival prediction ', ' predict survival ', ' predictor of survival ', ' deep learning ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NIDDK,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,520905,NC-04
"BRAIN Initiative: Assessing development of event-related cortical network dynamics Project Summary The Child Mind Institute’s Healthy Brain Network (HBN) is an ongoing initiative focused on creating and sharing a biobank of brain and behavioral data now being collected from 10,000 New York City area children and adolescents (ages 5-21). In response to RFA-MH-120-20 (‘Integration and analysis of BRAIN Initiative data’), we will collect their high-density EEG and continuous eye tracking data, recorded from now over 3,000 young participants while they watch movies and rest, plus participant MR head images, to create a developmental EEG and eye tracking data and analysis resource within the BRAIN Initiative-funded NEMAR portal (NEMAR.org) to the OpenNeuro human neuroimaging resource (OpenNeuro.org). We will store the data in accord with the latest advances in the Brain Imaging Data Standard (BIDS), including innovative co-registration of eye-tracking information and EEG, extraction of anonymized Leadfield matrices for advanced participant-based source localization, and Hierarchical Event Descriptor (HED) annotation of movie and eye tracking events in the data, to enable sophisticated exploratory and model-based analyses by any user of the Neuroscience Gateway (nsgportal.org), which offers processing of complex tasks on the U.S. XSEDE computer network (XSEDE.org) for users of standard neuroscience software. We propose to build on the large existing and readily extensible set of tools for analysis, modeling, and visualization of human EEG data in the world leading EEGLAB software environment for electrophysiological signal processing we develop and maintain (5R01-NS047293-15) (sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab), to process the large corpus of innovative EEG and synchronous eye tracking data recorded during movie viewing by the HBN project. We will then apply source-resolved event-related analysis models to cortical EEG network dynamics associated with movie watching, will model their changes across development, and will compare the time course of these changes with changes in eye gaze patterns at the same age levels. We will use cortical source-resolved, event-related functional EEG connectivity measures implemented in the Source Information Flow Toolbox (SIFT) to model event-related EEG dynamics of individual participants, and will apply advanced hierarchical Bayes-based methods and statistical assessment to perform statistical testing on subject group models. We will study the development of event-related cortical information flow during movie watching and rest across the large HBN developmental (5-21 years) sample, and compare it to the developmental trajectory of changes in eye gaze patterns during movie viewing.
