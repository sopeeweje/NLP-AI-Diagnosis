"Assessing Children's Screen Time with Wearable Sensor Project summary The explosion of digital technology ownership in the past decade has led to a dramatically increased screen exposure for children. In the United States, over 95% of families with children have a smartphone, TV, and desktop monitors, which has raised a growing concern about the impact of screens on children's health. Excessive screen exposure has been closely associated with increased eye problems, sleep disorders, obesity, and cognitive impairments among children. Due to these concerns, World Health Organization (WHO) has recently (April 2019) suggested that children between 2 and 4 should have less than 1 hour of sedentary screen time per day. However, there is an evidence gap between actual screen time in research and parental control and assessment from measurement tools. Existing methodologies of assessing screen exposure lack construct validity, as they heavily rely upon self-report, smartphone applications, or research technologies (e.g. eye- tracking glasses). Self-report is prone to reporting bias. Smartphone applications lack the capability of measuring cumulative, concurrent screen exposure across multiple screen types and are not able to confirm the identity of user (the same child or his/her parents). Research technologies, such as eye-tracking glasses, can be invasive to children and are limited to the measurement of regions of selective visual focus. Currently, there is no effective and minimally invasive tool that can be used to provide objective and accurate measurement of both sedentary screen use and screen exposure across multiple screen types. This project seeks to develop a wearable device and robust AI algorithms to provide objective and accurate screen time measurement for children. Aim 1 will develop a minimally invasive device and computer vision methods to detect screen exposure patterns and differentiate various screen type. Aim 2 will testify the design in a free-living environment on children. The proposed work will provide an important new tool to objectively and comprehensively measure children's cumulative and discrete free-living screen exposure in quantity and duration. We anticipate this technology will serve as a universal screen-time measurement tool and benefit parents, preschool teachers, and interest groups in their management and advocacy of child(ren)'s sedentary activities and media use. We also anticipate our tools will help academic researchers, clinical psychologist, and consumer researchers via providing objective measures in behavioral study and therapy. Project Narrative Children’s screen exposure is closely related to health issues such as increased eye problems, sleep disorders, obesity, and cognitive impairments among children. There is an unmet need to assess children’s daily screen exposure to aid the parental control and academic research on children’s development. This project will develop a wearable device and artificial intelligence (AI) technology to automatically provide accurate measurements of children’s screen exposure on multiple screen device, sedentary activity, and background exposure.",Assessing Children's Screen Time with Wearable Sensor,10109724,R21HD104164,"['Visual Accommodation ', ' Ocular Accommodation ', ' Visual Focusing ', ' eye accommodation ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Child Advocacy ', ' Child Development ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Communication ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Computers ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Explosion ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Family ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Interest Group ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Ownership ', ' Parents ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychology ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' pre-k ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' preschool ', ' Tablets ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Clinical ', ' sedentary ', ' teacher ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Measurement ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Hour ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' eye tracking ', ' visual tracking ', ' novel ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' sleep diseases ', ' sleep dysfunction ', ' sleep illness ', ' sleep problem ', ' Sleep Disorders ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' tv watching ', ' screen time ', ' television watching ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' minimally invasive ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' temporal measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' Accelerometer ', ' accelerometry ', ' activity monitor ', ' activity tracker ', ' sedentary activity ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' recruit ', ' smartphone Application ', ' Android App ', ' Android Application ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smartphone App ', ' iOS app ', ' iOS application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iPhone Application ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable biosensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' Child Health ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IN TUSCALOOSA,R21,2021,172059,AL-07
"Placement Success Predictor: Using Site-Customized Machine Learning Models to Predict the Best Level of Care Placement for Each Child's Behavioral Health Needs ABSTRACT  Hundreds of thousands of children (669,799) were confirmed victims of maltreatment in the United States in 2017; in that same year, of the 442,733 children in foster care, 34% had been in more than one placement and 11% were in a group home or institution. Out-of-home placement decisions have extremely high stakes for the present and future well-being of these children because some placement types, and multiple placements, are associated with poor outcomes. With the Family First Prevention Act, states will be required to pay the average $88,000 per year to keep a child in residential care if that high level of care is not authorized. But which children require --and, more importantly, would benefit-- from a placement in residential care? Decision-making support tools currently used by states to recommend specific level of care (LOC) placements for children do not maximize the rich data and innovative methodological approaches that are being explored in other fields like medicine. In addition, structured decision making (SDM) has been used to guide decisions about risk in child welfare settings but, in comparison to predictive modelling, SDM is limited by the use of a smaller group of factors to make recommendations. Outcome Referrals, Inc. has employed sophisticated machine learning techniques over the past 10 years to risk-adjust behavioral health outcome data for clients using baseline characteristics. Initial models predicted more than 30% of the outcome variance (i.e., it was possible to predict 30% of the variance in how depressed a client would be at follow-up). The next model improved that prediction to more than 50%, and our latest model has increased this to an average of 71%. With the assistance of Phase I NIH SBIR funding, we plan to improve the success rates of children in the child welfare system with an innovative, scientifically-derived product called “Placement Success Predictor.” To guide level-of-care decision-making, this product will use site-customized, machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of an adolescent having a good outcome in a particular placement type in a specific community. We have preliminary evidence supporting the feasibility of developing these models based on work supported by the Duke Endowment Foundation. During this six-month Phase I project, we propose to 1) validate these preliminary machine learning models by applying them to new client data from our partner behavioral health organization, 2) explore options for sharing results of these models to facilitate their use in practice (e.g., aggregate predictions across different domains in a weighted way), 3) assess key stakeholder satisfaction with a new prototype, and 4) develop and test customized models for multiple placement types with a state-wide child welfare and juvenile justice dataset. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Hundreds of thousands of children were confirmed victims of maltreatment in the United States in 2017; in that same year, of the 442,733 children in foster care, approximately one out of 10 were placed in a group home or institution. Out-of-home placement decisions have extremely high stakes for the present and future well-being of these vulnerable children because some placements, and multiple placements, are associated with poor outcomes. The likelihood of success recommendations provided by the proposed “Placement Success Predictor” tool will help placement staff and administrators identify the best placement setting for each child using machine-learning statistics to predict the child’s chances of success in each potential treatment setting.",Placement Success Predictor: Using Site-Customized Machine Learning Models to Predict the Best Level of Care Placement for Each Child's Behavioral Health Needs,10138072,R43MH125486,"['Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Child Care ', ' Puericulture ', ' Child Welfare ', ' adolescent welfare ', ' child well being ', ' child wellbeing ', ' Client ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Endowment ', ' Family ', ' Federal Government ', ' National Government ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Group Homes ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Justice ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Medicine ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Methodology ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Team Nursing ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Probability ', ' Receiver Operating Characteristics ', ' Receiver Operator Characteristics ', ' Recommendation ', ' Residential Treatment ', ' residential care ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Administrator ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Managed Care ', ' Schedule ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' Friction ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Psychiatric therapeutic procedure ', ' psychiatric care ', ' psychiatric therapy ', ' psychiatric treatment ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' satisfaction ', ' Funding ', ' depressed ', ' sadness ', ' Depressed mood ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' foster care ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' prevention service ', ' treatment program ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' gatekeeper ', ' Gatekeeping ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral health ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' health organization ', ' Provider ', ' Institution ', ' Data ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' maltreatment ', ' mistreatment ', ' severe mental illness ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' support tools ', ' improved outcome ', ' predictive tools ', ' care costs ', ' care coordination ', ' coordinating care ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIMH,OUTCOME REFERRALS INC,R43,2021,220720,MA-05
"Development of clinical decision tools for management of diarrhea of children in high and low resource settings Abstract Diarrheal diseases are the among the leading cause of death in children worldwide, most of which occur in low-income countries. In high-income countries, pediatric diarrhea remains a major utilization of healthcare resources. Treatment of diarrhea is mostly empiric, with antibiotic use mostly based on clinical suspicion for bacterial causes. However, the majority of cases of diarrhea do not benefit from antibiotic use, and inappropriate use leads to toxicity and resistance. Furthermore, despite the increasing availability of rapid molecular testing, there is little data to base a decision of whom or when to test. Our overarching goal is to develop and validate clinical decision tools for management of diarrheal illnesses in children of both high and low resource settings. We will utilize prospectively-collected data from two recently-completed multicenter cohort studies of pediatric diarrhea. These studies feature extensive etiologic testing, well-characterized clinical elements, and longitudinal outcome data. We have assembled a team with expertise in pediatric diarrhea, clinical prediction rules, and machine learning methods. In Aim 1, we will use domestic data to develop and validate: a) a score for bacterial etiology, and b) a score for which patients are likely to benefit from further testing. We will derive the scores using data from IMPACT, an NIH-sponsored study of 1200 children from 5 US Emergency Departments, and validate using electronic health records from the Utah Intermountain Health System. In Aim 2, we will use international data to develop and validate: a) a diagnostic score for bacterial etiology, and b) a prognostic score for risk stratification of children who go on to poor outcomes. We will derive the scores using data from GEMS, a study of over 9400 children across 7 low-resource countries, and validate using VIDA study of children in 3 African countries. Completion of the Aims will result in the availability of a number of clinical tools that healthcare workers worldwide can use for evidence-based care of children with diarrhea. Project Narrative Diarrheal diseases are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. The management of childhood diarrhea often depend on what type of pathogen is responsible, but in many cases testing is not affordable or feasible. We propose studies to develop clinical scores to make it easier for healthcare workers to decide how to manage children with diarrhea.",Development of clinical decision tools for management of diarrhea of children in high and low resource settings,10137881,R01AI135114,"['Accounting ', ' Africa ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' Bacterial Infections ', ' bacteria infection ', ' bacterial disease ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Child Care ', ' Puericulture ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diarrhea ', ' Elements ', ' Feces ', ' stool ', ' Gastroenteritis ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Utah ', ' Vaccines ', ' Case Management ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Microscopic ', ' prognostic ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' African ', ' Logistics ', ' Sample Size ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' tool ', ' Antibiotic Treatment ', ' bacterial disease treatment ', ' bacterial infectious disease treatment ', ' Antibiotic Therapy ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Techniques ', ' Country ', ' Test Result ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Performance ', ' microbial ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Molecular Diagnostic Methods ', ' Molecular Diagnostic Technics ', ' Molecular Diagnostic Techniques ', ' Enteric ', ' Enteral ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Health system ', ' Cost Efficient Management ', ' Cost Effective Management ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' International ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' point of care ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Resistance development ', ' Resistant development ', ' developing resistance ', ' pathogen ', ' prospective ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' antimicrobial ', ' anti-microbial ', ' Pathogen detection ', ' evidence base ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' LMIC ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' molecular diagnostics ', ' low income country ', ' Prospective cohort study ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' clinical diagnostics ', ' clinical development ', ' diarrheal disease ', ' diarrheal illness ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2021,390449,UT-02
"Characterizing resilience to food-cue induced overeating in children Project Summary: While strong empirical evidence shows that exposure to food advertisements increases short-term food intake and contributes to the development of obesity, not all children are susceptible to this effect. Identifying the characteristics that protect some children from overeating in response to food advertising is a public health priority that may highlight novel targets for childhood obesity prevention. We propose to use state-of-the art, data driven techniques to identify neural, cognitive and behavioral phenotypes that are associated with resiliency to food-cue induced overeating and determine whether these phenotypes protect children from weight gain during the critical pre-adolescent period. The driving premise of this proposal is that children who are resistant to food-cue induced overeating will exhibit a distinct cluster of neural, behavioral, and cognitive traits which protect them from weight gain in an obesogenic environment. Our preliminary studies suggest that greater neural activation in prefrontal cortical regions implicated in cognitive control, increased executive functioning, and lower food advertising exposure may be some of the characteristics that confer resiliency to overeating in response to food advertising cues. To confirm our preliminary findings, we plan to enroll 140, 7-8 year-old children with healthy weight who vary by risk for obesity (70 low-risk/both parents with healthy weight; 70 high-risk/both parents with obesity) for a 1-year prospective study. In aim one, we will compare the effect of exposing children to commercials (i.e., food, toy, and non-rewarding advertisements) on subsequent neural activation and network connectivity characteristics in response to viewing high-energy food cues. We hypothesize that exposure to food commercials (vs. toy and non-food) will reduce prefrontal cortex activation, but that there will be substantial variability in this response across children. In aim two, we will determine how food commercials affect children’s subsequent food intake at both homeostatic (i.e., ad libitum test-meals) and non-homeostatic (i.e., eating palatable snacks when not hungry) eating events and relate these responses to underlying neural circuitry. In aim three, we will test the extent to which children’s executive function and prior food advertising experience moderate the relationship between food commercial exposure and subsequent neural and behavioral outcomes. In the final aim, we will use sophisticated data-driven techniques (i.e., machine learning) to identify neural, behavioral, and cognitive traits that moderate the effect of familial risk status on weight-gain. We expect the proposed studies to inform the science of obesity prevention by identifying specific modifiable phenotypes that protect high-risk children from excess weight gain during the pre-adolescent period. The overall impact of these studies will be to identify novel neural and behavioral characteristics of resiliency to food advertising in children. It will be the first to focus specifically on characterizing neural resiliency factors associated with decreased risk of food-cue induced eating and determine the extent to which these factors protect pre-adolescent children from the development of obesity. Project Narrative: Reducing excess food consumption in response to food advertising is a public health goal for preventing excess weight gain and the development of obesity in children. Food marketing is a major contributor to childhood obesity, and the proposed research will identify neurobiological and behavioral characteristics that protect some children from overeating in the presence of this cue. These findings will have direct implications for the development of more effective strategies to reduce energy intake for the prevention of obesity.",Characterizing resilience to food-cue induced overeating in children,10049781,R01DK126050,"['Advertising ', ' Affect ', ' Attention ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Energy Intake ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Child Development ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Cues ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Foundations ', ' Hyperphagia ', ' Overeating ', ' polyphagia ', ' Laboratories ', ' Literature ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Parents ', ' Phenotype ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Toy ', ' Weight Gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' wt gain ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Structure of postcentral gyrus ', ' Postcentral Gyrus ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Individual ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' pre-adolescent ', ' preteen ', ' preadolescence ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' trait ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Prevention program ', ' Palate ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' response ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' Advertisements ', ' Brain region ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' DEXA ', ' DXA ', ' Dual-Energy Xray Absorptiometry ', ' Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' obesity in children ', ' child adiposity ', ' child obesity ', ' childhood adiposity ', ' childhood obesity ', ' obese children ', ' obesity during childhood ', ' pediatric obesity ', ' Food Energy ', ' food consumption ', ' obesity prevention ', ' prevent obesity ', ' approach behavior ', ' food marketing ', ' food ads ', ' food advertising ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' resilience ', ' prospective ', ' Consumption ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' hedonic ', ' 8 year old ', ' 8 years of age ', ' age 8 years ', ' eight year old ', ' eight years of age ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' somatosensory ', ' obesity risk ', ' risk for obesity ', ' risk of obesity ', ' cognitive control ', ' high risk ', ' critical period ', ' obesogenic ', ' obesigenic ', ' eating in absence of hunger ', ' public health priorities ', ' healthy weight ', ' behavioral response ', ' behavior response ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' obesity development ', ' neural network ', ' health goals ', ' behavioral phenotyping ', ' behavior phenotype ', ' excessive weight gain ', ' extreme weight gain ', ' serious weight gain ', ' severe weight gain ', ' ']",NIDDK,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2021,603724,PA-12
"Severity Predictors Integrating salivary Transcriptomics and proteomics with Multi neural network Intelligence in SARS-CoV2 infection in Children (SPITS MISC) Abstract Children have been disproportionately less impacted by the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SAR-CoV-2) compared to adults. However, severe illnesses including Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C) and respiratory failure have occurred in a small proportion of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nearly 80% of children with MIS-C are critically ill with a 2-4% mortality rate. Currently there are no modalities to characterize the spectrum of disease severity and predict which child with SARS-CoV-2 exposure will likely develop severe illness including MIS-C. Thus there is an urgent need to develop a diagnostic modality to distinguish the varying phenotypes of disease and risk stratify disease. The epigenetic changes in microRNA (miRNA) profiles that occur due to an infection can impact disease severity by altering immune response and cytokine regulation which may be detected in body fluids including saliva. Our long-term goal is to improve outcomes of children with SARS-CoV-2 by early identification and treatment of those at risk for severe illness. Our central hypothesis is that a model that integrates salivary biomarkers with social and clinical determinants of health will predict disease severity in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The central hypothesis will be pursued through phased four specific aims. The first two aims will be pursued during the R61 phase and include: 1) Define and compare the salivary molecular host response in children with varying phenotypes (severe and non severe) SARS-CoV-2 infections and 2) Develop and validate a sensitive and specific model to predict severe SARS-CoV-2 illness in children. During the R33 phase we will pursue the following two aims: 3) Develop a portable, rapid device that quantifies salivary miRNAs with comparable accuracy to predicate technology (qRT-PCR), and 4) Develop an artificial intelligence (AI) assisted cloud and mobile system for early recognition of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. We will pursue the above aims using an innovative combination of salivaomics and bioinformatics, analytic techniques of AI and clinical informatics. The proposed research is significant because development of a sensitive model to risk stratify disease is expected to improve outcomes of children with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection via early recognition and timely intervention. The proximate expected outcome of this proposal is better understanding of the epigenetic regulation of host immune response to the viral infection which we expect to lead to personalized therapy in the future. The results will have a positive impact immediately as it will lead to the creation of patient profiles based on individual risk factors which can enable early identification of severe disease and appropriate resource allocation during the pandemic. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project is relevant to public health as development of a predictive model that integrates salivary biomarkers with clinical and social determinants into a bedside tool will enable early identification of severe COVID-19 in children, ensure appropriate resource allocation and aid in targeted treatment.",Severity Predictors Integrating salivary Transcriptomics and

"Center for Machine Learning in Urology PROJECT SUMMARY We propose to establish an Exploratory Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Benign Urology at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and the University of Pennsylvania (Penn), the central mission of which is to apply machine learning to improve the understanding of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, risk stratification, and prediction of treatment responses of benign urological disease among children and adults. The proposed CHOP/Penn Center for Machine Learning in Urology (CMLU) addresses critical structural and scientific barriers that impede the development of new treatments and the effective application of existing treatments for benign urologic disease across the lifespan. Structurally, urologic research occurs in silos, with little interaction among investigators that study different diseases or different populations (e.g. pediatric and adult). Scientifically, analysis of imaging and other types complex data is limited by inter-observer variability, and incomplete utilization of available information. This proposal overcomes these barriers by applying cutting-edge approaches in machine learning to analyze CT images that are routinely obtained for evaluation of individuals with kidney stone disease. Central to the CHOP/Penn CMLU is the partnership of urologists and experts in machine learning, which will bring a new approach to generating knowledge that advances research and clinical care. In addition, the CMLU will expand the urologic research community by providing a research platform and standalone machine learning executables that could be applied to other datasets. The Center’s mission will be achieved through the following Aims, with progress assessed through systematic evaluation: Aim 1. To expand the research base investigating benign urological disease. We will establish a community with the research base, particularly with the KURe, UroEpi programs, other P20 Centers, and O’Brien Centers. We will build this community by providing mini-coaching clinics to facilitate application of machine learning to individual projects, developing an educational hub for synchronous and asynchronous engagement with the research base, and making freely available all source codes and standalone executables for all machine learning tools. Aim 2. To improve prediction of ureteral stone passage using machine learning of CT images. The CMLU has developed deep learning methods that segment and automate measurement of urinary stones and adjacent renal anatomy. In the Research Project, we will compare these methods to existing segmentation methods and the current gold standard of manual measurement. We will then extract informative features from thousands of CT scans to predict the probability of spontaneous passage of ureteral stones for children and adults evaluated in the CHOP and Penn healthcare systems. Aim 3. To foster collaboration in benign urological disease research across levels of training and centers through an Educational Enrichment Program. We will amplify interactions across institutions and engage investigators locally and nationally by providing summer research internships, and interinstitutional exchange program, and an annual research symposium. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed CHOP/Penn O’Brien Center for Machine Learning in Urology addresses critical structural and scientific barriers that impede development of new treatments and the effective application of existing treatments for benign urologic disease across the lifespan.

"Opportunities to optimize the receipt of preventive services among children with sickle cell anemia: A Mixed Methods Approach PROJECT SUMMARY The proposed project will provide critical information to inform the development and implementation of interventions to improve the receipt of preventive services among children with sickle cell anemia. National guidelines strongly recommend that children with sickle cell anemia receive routine screenings and be offered preventive medications to reduce the risk of serious complications including infections, strokes, and pain crises. Although these complications are associated with increased health services utilization and cost, and reduced quality of life, only 40% of children receive routine screenings and less than 20% receive preventive medications. Significantly, the mechanisms driving quality gaps in the receipt of preventive services are unknown, limiting our ability to develop and implement impactful interventions. The overall objective of this study is to shed light on these mechanisms and identify opportunities to optimize receipt of preventive services among children with sickle cell anemia, thus reducing disease burden and improving quality of life. The proposed study directly impacts the following AHRQ priority populations: children, racial and ethnic minorities, low-income patients, and those with special healthcare needs. As such, it aligns with AHRQ’s mission to improve efficiency and quality of health care delivery for vulnerable populations.  Using a mixed methods approach, we will (1) identify critical targets within the healthcare delivery system, as well as key subgroups of the population, through which intervention can improve the receipt of preventive services for children with sickle cell anemia; (2) identify barriers to and facilitators of receipt of preventive services, and (3) integrate the quantitative findings of patterns of care and adherence deficiencies with the qualitative findings of barriers and facilitators to preventive services to identify intervention targets and strategies that are most likely to improve receipt of preventive services. The mixed methods approach includes analyzing data from three large complementary, nationally representative datasets, combined with primary qualitative data collection. The datasets provide a novel opportunity to provide a population-based perspective on the care of children with sickle cell anemia, as well as national data on prescribing practices. Quantitative methods, including machine learning and time-dependent survival analysis, will enable us to characterize patterns of care associated with receipt of preventive services, as well variation in adherence across providers, patients, caregivers, and insurance type. Qualitative, key informant interviews with provider teams, caregivers, and patients will identify potential barriers to and facilitators of adherence to each preventive service, as well as opportunities for intervention. Finally, the visual integration of the quantitative analysis with the qualitative findings through a joint display will provide essential information regarding which intervention targets and strategies are most likely to improve receipt of preventive services and ultimately reduce morbidity among children with sickle cell anemia. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed study will provide essential information regarding which intervention targets and strategies are most likely to improve receipt of preventive services and ultimately reduce morbidity among children with SCA. We will use quantitative methods to identify critical targets within the healthcare delivery system, as well as key subgroups of the population, that can be intervened upon to improve the receipt of preventive services, and qualitative methods to identify barriers and facilitators to receipt of these services. We will integrate the findings from the quantitative analysis with the results from the qualitative analysis to fill the gap in understanding specific targets within the healthcare system, key population subgroups, and feasible strategies for interventions to maximize the receipt of preventive services among children with sickle cell anemia.",Opportunities to optimize the receipt of preventive services among children with sickle cell anemia: A Mixed Methods Approach,10294429,R01HS027785,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,395994,MI-12
"Predicting Outcomes in Children with Ulcerative Colitis Summary/Abstract Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic intestinal disorder, a type of inﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD). UC causes abdominal pain, diarrhea, bleeding and weight loss. Each year there are about 38,000 new UC cases with about 25-30% being children. UC is often more severe in children than adults. There is no standard regimen for managing all people with UC. Treatment of UC includes 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), corticosteroids, immunomodulators, biologics and surgery to remove the colon. Ideally a personalized medicine approach should be taken to tailor therapy to the individual patient based on their disease severity and predicted response. However, there is currently a lack of guidance to clinicians as to which children are going to do well with these medications and who needs more medication exposure or surgery. To address this important issue, a clinical trial of standardized medical therapy was launched enrolling 428 children newly diagnosed with UC at 29 pediatric medical centers in North America (Predicting Response to Standardized Pediatric Colitis Therapy: The PROTECT Study). The PROTECT study collected clinical, genetic, environment and immune factors along with biospecimens including blood, stool, and colonic tissue. It was anticipated that a combination of clinical, genetic, and immunologic tests performed at diagnosis can construct a valuable predictive model for personalized medicine which can be implemented to improve clinical outcomes such as early and late remission on 5-ASA only without the concurrent use of steroid medications. Along this line, state-of-art machine learning algorithms can ultimately utilize the PROTECT study data and more accurately predict clinical outcomes. The ability to develop accurate predictive models using basic clinical, endoscopic, histologic, and laboratory data would be extremely helpful to clinicians, as well as to patients/families in helping them better understand the decision making process. ML-based models will be validated with external electronic health records data. Further, there is a lack of easy- to-use clinical decision support tool to help clinicians make decisions in the ﬁeld. This study will ﬁll the gap. Project Narrative The proposed project will accurately predict early and late clinical outcomes of patients following initial standard therapy in children with ulcerative colitis.

"Effectiveness and predictors of response for a technology-based reading intervention in the home Project Summary/Abstract. Reading Disability (RD) is the most common learning disability, affecting 10 – 15% of school age children. It incurs major functional impairments at all stages of life, with a wealth of data documenting lifelong disadvantages in educational and occupational attainment. Therefore, identifying effective and affordable treatments for RD is a high priority for reading researchers, clinicians and educators. Problematically, current evidence-based reading interventions largely rely on services by trained specialists, either in well-resourced classrooms or clinical settings. As such, under-resourced schools (or countries) often are unable to provide reading interventions for their students. In recent years, technology-based reading interventions have been proposed as a means of overcoming these challenges, as they can be administered in the home, without direct expert supervision - thereby minimizing resource demands. In the area of reading-focused EdTech, GraphoLearn has emerged as a leader, with the largest evidence-base to date. However, the vast majority of studies to date have been conducted in highly controlled settings, rather than the home environment it was intended for – leaving open questions about effectiveness. Additionally, similar to any intervention, not all children with RD benefit equally from treatment; however little attention has been given to identifying predictors of treatment response. Here we propose to evaluate the effectiveness of home-administered GraphoLearn through the implementation of a large-scale, randomized controlled trial (RCT) in 450 reading disabled children (boys and girls, ages 6.0- 10.0). To accomplish this goal rapidly and with minimal cost, we will recruit participants from the Healthy Brain Network [HBN], an ongoing study of mental health and learning disorders in children, ages 5.0-21.0, whose family have concerns about behavior and/or learning (target n = 10,000; current n = 3000+). The availability of comprehensive characterizations (e.g., demographic, cognitive, mental health, EEG, multimodal MRI) for all HBN participants makes the sample optimal for exploring an extensive set of participant and environmental factors that may affect treatment outcomes (i.e., demographic, cognitive, emotional, neurobiological, environmental). Specific aims of the proposed work are to: 1) Evaluate the effectiveness of GraphoLearn in a large sample of children with RD, and 2) Identify participant-related and environment-level factors that are significantly associated with GraphoLearn outcomes. To accomplish this latter aim, sophisticated machine learning approaches (Random Forest Regression models) will be employed. Project Narrative This project is motivated by two significant overarching problems (1) existing avenues for reading intervention in the US are not available to most children in need of help, and (2) across children there is substantial variability in pre-to-post intervention gains in reading. This project will evaluate the effectiveness of a home delivered technology-based (Edtech) reading intervention in a large and diverse sample of children, and identify factors that facilitate (or hinder) positive Edtech intervention outcomes.",Effectiveness and predictors of response for a technology-based reading intervention in the home,10248554,R01HD101842,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Control Groups ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Environment ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Learning ', ' Learning Disorders ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Matched Group ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methodology ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Reading ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Schools ', ' sound ', ' Students ', ' Supervision ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Specialist ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Training ', ' Fostering ', ' School-Age Population ', ' school age ', ' Sample Size ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Disabled Children ', ' Children with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped Children ', ' Letters ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Home environment ', ' Country ', ' Occupational ', ' Services ', ' phonology ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Learning disability ', ' Learning Disabilities ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' Reading disability ', ' Reading Disabilities ', ' response ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict treatment response ', ' therapy prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Reader ', ' Cognitive ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' active control ', ' post intervention ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' remediation ', ' Outcome ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' evidence base ', ' intervention effect ', ' predicting response ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' language impairment ', ' random forest ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' Home ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2021,637749,CT-02
"Using Machine Learning to Predict Clinical Deterioration in Hospitalized Children PROJECT SUMMARY Children who are admitted to the hospital and experience deterioration have a high risk of mortality and poor long-term health. Current warning early scores indicating risk of deterioration are subjectively derived and have not reduced in-hospital mortality. In recent work, I developed a vital sign based statistical model that demonstrated improved accuracy over current risk scores at predicting clinical deterioration in hospitalized children 24 hours in advance. Within adults, the combination of longitudinal data analysis techniques, machine learning, and electronic health record (EHR) data have led to highly accurate early warning scores. Therefore, my aim in this grant proposal is to utilize longitudinal integration of EHR data in a machine learning framework to develop a model for predicting clinical deterioration in hospitalized children as early as possible. I will do this by first deriving and validating a prediction model using structured EHR data collected from three pediatric hospitals (Aim 1). Using the same cohort, I will then build and validate a prediction model using features derived from unstructured clinical notes (Aim 2). I will also compare if the addition of unstructured features improves the prediction accuracy of the model derived in Aim 1. Finally, I will determine the association between non-patient level environmental variables within the hospital ecosystem and risk of clinical deterioration in hospitalized children (Aim 3). I will also determine if the addition of these environmental risk factors improves performance of the prediction model derived through Aims 1 and 2. Completion of this proposal will result in a validated pediatric risk prediction model that will enable clinicians to recognize early signs of deterioration in hospitalized children. This will facilitate timely intervention, thereby saving lives and improving long-term health. In addition, this grant will also provide me with crucial data for a future R01 trial aimed at assessing the impact of the prediction model in reducing mortality, decreasing costs, and improving long-term outcomes in hospitalized children. To establish myself as an independent investigator in pediatric prediction modeling, I propose a training plan that includes comprehensive didactics and mentorship in the areas of longitudinal data analysis, advanced machine learning, natural language processing, and concepts in pediatric care. I have assembled a first-class mentorship team comprised of national experts in longitudinal data analysis techniques and EHR-based machine learning (Robert Gibbons PhD and Matthew Churpek MD, PhD). My advisory team is comprised of experts in natural language processing (Dmitriy Dligach PhD), clinical decision support around deterioration events (Dana Edelson MD, MS and Priti Jani MD), and pediatric early warning scores (Christopher Parshuram MB., ChB., D. Phil., FRACP). By completing my research and career development goals, I will develop into an independent expert investigator in developing pediatric prediction models for ultimately improving outcomes in hospitalized children. PROJECT NARRATIVE Clinical deterioration in hospitalized children is associated with high-risk of mortality as well as complications in their long-term health. An improved prediction model capable of identifying pediatric patients at risk of clinical deterioration as early as possible can facility timely and proper intervention, thereby decreasing preventable death and improving long-term outcomes in hospitalized children.",Using Machine Learning to Predict Clinical Deterioration in Hospitalized Children,10455253,K01HL148390,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Chicago ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Hospitalized Child ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Heart Arrest ', ' Asystole ', ' Cardiac Arrest ', ' Hospitals ', ' Pediatric Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Hylobates Genus ', ' Gibbons ', ' Hylobates ', ' Nomascus ', ' Symphalangus ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Maps ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' mortality ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' Publishing ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Savings ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Hospital Mortality ', ' In-house Mortalities ', ' Inhospital Mortality ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Hospitalization cost ', ' Training ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Early Intervention ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Cardiopulmonary ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Modality ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' ward ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' Detection ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' Neurological outcome ', ' Neurologic outcome ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' high risk ', ' control trial ', ' electronic structure ', ' clinical risk ', ' clinical predictors ', ' pediatric patients ', ' child patients ', ' improved outcome ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' clinical decision support ', ' preventable death ', ' preventable mortality ', ' risk prediction model ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' unstructured data ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K01,2021,140005,WI-02
"Integration of markers across physiologic, behavioral, and self-report levels at baseline and in response to treatment to characterize novel subtypes in youth with ADHD Project Summary This Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) will facilitate Dr. Leikauf’s development into an independent researcher and child psychiatrist. It will provide the foundation for him to meaningfully improve strategies for cost-effective personalization of care for ADHD and related emotional disorders in diverse practice settings through a deeper understanding of the underlying phenotypic heterogeneity of these disorders. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is highly prevalent and functionally impairing, yet phenotypically heterogeneous. Despite the complexity of the phenotype, the diagnosis is most often made using DSM-based behavioral symptom rating scales during short visits in busy pediatric settings. Additionally, current treatments are widely used but have not been demonstrated to improve functional outcomes. Currently, treatment selection involves significant trial-and-error based on caregiver’s subjective report of symptomatic improvement. Cost-effective, objective measures that would aid in personalized treatment selection and address the full range of dysfunction for children with ADHD are critically needed. The heterogeneity of the disorder has limited the development of such tools. Until now, the field has relied on subtypes that have limited validity and are based exclusively on symptom rating scales. Recent developments in our ability to collect and analyze multidimensional data for individual subjects provide a new opening for progress in this crucial area. The project will use two multi-dimensional datasets from completed clinical trials as well as generate data from a smaller, prospective study. The anticipated outcomes are as follows: 1) identification of more phenotypically homogeneous groups of children with ADHD at baseline 2) identification of more homogeneous groups based on creating a multivariate classifier informed by mechanistic response to treatment, and 3) validation of classification schema. Dr. Leikauf’s specific training goals, in collaboration with his mentorship team, include acquisition of knowledge, experience, and skills in the following areas relevant to the proposed work: 1) modern machine-learning statistical techniques that allow reliable inferences to be drawn from high dimensional data with non-linear relationships between variables; 2) mentored experience conducting a multi- method/multi-dimensional prospective study with the goal of identifying personalized therapeutic targets 3) additional translational research/clinical experience to understand what is currently known about ADHD and its relationship to cognitive dysfunction including working memory, sustained attention, and response inhibition, and 4) training in acquisition and analysis of EEG. The results should have immediate clinical impact and provide the foundation for a future prospective personalized therapeutics trial. The experiences in this proposal, if awarded, will also develop Dr. Leikauf’s abilities and thereby enable him to have a fundamental impact on mental health treatment for children and adolescents. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder affects at least 5% of children, resulting in significant psychosocial impairment and predisposing children to very high rates of later psychiatric disorders. However, current treatments do not work for all children, do little to improve long-term functional outcomes, and, in practice, are discontinued by approximately half of families within 1-3 years due to poor tolerability or perceived lack of long-term efficacy. Personalized targeting of treatments to maximize benefit and minimize harms for each individual is urgently needed but has been stymied by our limited understanding of the heterogeneous relationships between self-report, cognitive, and physiologic measures of the symptoms of the disorder; this proposal aims to use modern computational approaches to integrate information across these different measures in order to identify more homogeneous ADHD subtypes based in neurologic and cognitive deficits rather than self-report.","Integration of markers across physiologic, behavioral, and

"Leveraging the electronic health record to characterize and optimize care delivery for children with cerebral palsy. Abstract/summary Leveraging the electronic health record to characterize and optimize care delivery for children  with cerebral palsy: Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common physical disability of childhood, but it is highly  heterogeneous with respect to its severity, response to therapy, care needs, and impact on wellness  for the child and family. To optimize health and wellness throughout life and enable new research  avenues to be effectively tested, it is critical to develop a comprehensive clinical care and  biopsychosocial data model. Development of a comprehensive model would both accelerate and improve  understanding, care, and further research, including the identification of novel targets for  interventions. The overriding objective of this proposal is to develop a precision health model for CP-related phenotypes, health status, care activities, and psychosocial well-being that will individualize care. To accomplish this objective, we will automate the collection, cleaning, and integration of multi-dimensional, multi-domain and multi-cohort based ""big data"" extracted from the electronic health record (EHR), and combine this EHR data with prospectively  collected, high-resolution clinical, functional, environmental and psychosocial data. The focus of this proposal will be on children between ages 6 and 12 years. Preliminary work indicates that the medical center provides care for  approximately 1,800 patients with CP who are between the ages of 6 and 12 years and have at least  three years of EHR data. From this EHR cohort, we will prospectively recruit 200 children and their  families for detailed phenotyping. Recruitment will be stratified by Gross Motor Functional Classification System (GMFCS) Levels: 60%  GMFCS I, II, or III (able to walk) and 40% GMFCS IV or V (use a wheelchair). Using this  multi-cohort design will allow for robust characterization of multi-dimensional factors that impact care receipt, functional  outcomes, quality of life and participation. Aim 1 will focus on creating a diverse and comprehensive data repository  using both retrospective and prospective data to characterize actual versus optimal care (defined  by current evidence-based literature). Aim 2 will lead to development of a receipt of care  coefficient score and characterize how the degree of optimal care relates to function, quality of  life and participation, controlling for functional status and age. [Models developed in Aim 2 will  be translated into a clinical decision tool prototype. Aim 3 will demonstrate proof of concept for  scalability of machine learning algorithms with the PEDSnet Learning Health System. This project  innovatively combines retrospective EHR data with prospective clinical data to elucidate  individual, treatment, family, and environmental factors associated with greater receipt of  evidence-based care and/or better outcomes. This project will move the field toward precision  medicine for CP and create a foundation for development of clinical dashboards to optimize practice.] Project Narrative The proposed project innovatively applies machine learning methods to retrospective electronic  health record and prospective clinical data to develop a precision health model for cerebral  palsy-related phenotypes, health status, care activities, and psychosocial well-being that will  individualize care.

"Neural mechanisms of risk and resilience in early childhood irritability PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Irritability, defined as lowered threshold for anger when experiencing the RDoC construct frustrative non-reward, i.e., failing to receive expected rewards, is one of the most common reasons for pediatric psychiatric evaluation. Our work shows that early detection is critical: If irritability in preschool-age (3-6 years, before 1st grade) continues into school-age (after 1st grade), as it does for approximately 50% of preschool-age irritable children, such persistent irritability puts children on the path to mental disorder across the lifespan. Thus, identifying the neural mechanisms by which children persist vs. remit in irritability is paramount to intervene in the earliest phase of the clinical cascade. Irritability is linked with abnormalities in reward processing, which may lead to greater frustration when rewards are not received. Such reward processing vulnerabilities may be ameliorated by better inhibitory control, which normatively increases with maturation. However, the interplay between reward processing and inhibition in irritability trajectories is unknown. Investigating longitudinal changes in neural circuitry during this developmental period is important because the reward- and inhibition-related neural networks undergo substantial change and may be most malleable to early intervention. Our overall goal is to identify reward- and inhibition-related neural pathways that characterize persistence vs. remission of early childhood irritability. To this end, the proposed project will longitudinally characterize the neural and symptom trajectories of preschool-age children into school-age. We will collect measures of reward- and inhibitory control-related brain function at baseline and 24-month follow-up from 215 5-6-year-old children prior to 1st grade, alongside assessments of child irritability and inhibition at each 6-month follow-up. A comprehensive assessment of child (cognition, temperament, psychopathology), parent (psychopathology) and contextual factors (e.g., parenting, stressors) will also be assessed at baseline and 24-month assessments. Our central hypothesis is that young children with reward- and inhibition-related neural deficits are more likely to persist in irritability compared to those who remit. Specific aims are to identify (1) concurrent contributions of reward- and inhibition-related neural function to irritability at each age (preschool-age, school-age); (2) developmental changes in reward- and inhibition-related neural mechanisms of irritability trajectories from early to middle childhood; (3) early childhood reward- and inhibition-related neural predictors of irritability trajectories and future psychopathology; and (4) the moderating role of child sex, parent psychopathology, parenting, and life stress on these brain-behavior associations. This proposal will advance the field by revealing the neural circuitry of irritability risk and resilience. Innovative aspects include focusing on a key age range (5-6 years) to prevent later disorders, multiple time point imaging, and machine learning methodology. Our project is significant because it will pave the way for precision medicine for irritability: providing the right treatment (based on neural mechanisms) to the right people (children who will persist in irritability), at the right time (preschool age, before irritability problems worsen). PROJECT NARRATIVE Because preschool-age irritability that persists into school-age predicts lifespan mental disorder and poorer functional outcomes, identifying the neural mechanisms by which children persist vs. remit in irritability is paramount to intervene in the earliest phase of the clinical cascade.

"A study of antibiotics usage on early gut microbiome colonization and establishment in young children PROJECT SUMMARY The emergence and transmission of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is currently one of the most critical public health threats. As such there is an urgent need to identify new ways to reduce AMR transmission. In recent years, several studies have started to reveal the complex relations and interactions between antibiotics, antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and the human microbiome. The human microbiome plays profound roles in responding to antibiotic treatment and the transmission of ARGs. The altered microbiome, especially in children, may have a distinct resistome (the entire ARGs in the microbiome community). Infants and young children receive frequent antimicrobial courses for common respiratory infections and are thought to spread ARGs effectively in the community. Otitis media is the most common reason for antimicrobial treatment in children. The antibiotic treatment that is selected for use in young children may significantly influence AMR spread in the communities. To date, there are a limited number of prospective, controlled comparative studies on how selected antibiotics affect the development of antibiotic resistance in the microbiome in young children. It is not possible to investigate children in an experimental way and expose them to antibiotics without an indication for the treatment. Non-severe acute otitis media, however, is an excellent clinical model to investigate the impact of different antimicrobial agents, since clinical guidelines suggest several alternative approaches to treat children, including watchful waiting without antibiotics. In this study, we will investigate the impact of the most commonly used antibiotics on the intestinal microbiome, and in particular the resistome in children with otitis media. The Oulu University study is IRB approved and has started enrolling infants and young children with non-severe otitis media in a study cohort and plan to finish the enrollment within the first few months of this project. Children are randomly allocated in four antibiotic treatment groups to compare the impact of amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, azithromycin, or no treatment on the intestinal microbiome and ARGs. We will solicit the antibiotic exposure during lifetime and collect stool samples before (day 0) and three days after the antibiotic course (day 10). We will apply quantitative PCR, 16S rDNA and metagenomic sequencing on different platforms to characterize the microbiome and resistome over time. De novo genome assembly based on Oxford Nanopore long reads technology, combined with high depth Illumina sequencing will reveal the details of ARGs and gene variants between species, and between microbiome communities, and show us novel mobile elements containing ARGs, which may be potentially transferred horizontally between species. We will apply machine learning approaches to quantitatively study how each bacterial species responds to and survives under antibiotic exposure, by analyzing genomic variants in ARGs, changes in three dimensional structure of the key ARGs, ARG network and pathways. PROJECT NARRATIVE Antibiotic resistant bacteria are a growing threat for public health. This proposal involves a randomized, controlled study of how the human microbiome in young children responds to different antimicrobial agents and will reveal possible genomic mechanisms by which this occurs thereby providing insight into potential new approaches to address the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria.",A study of antibiotics usage on early gut microbiome colonization and establishment in young children,10113538,R21AI151730,"['Affect ', ' Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Amoxicillin ', ' Amoxicilline ', ' Amoxil ', ' Amoxycillin ', ' Hydroxyampicillin ', ' Polymox ', ' Trimox ', ' Utimox ', ' Wymox ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Comparative Study ', ' Recombinant DNA ', ' Recombinant DNA Molecular Biology ', ' rDNA ', ' Elements ', ' Exhibits ', ' Genome ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Allergy ', ' Infant ', ' Intestines ', ' Intestinal ', ' bowel ', ' Otitis Media ', ' middle ear infection ', ' Plasmids ', ' Play ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Public Health ', ' Respiratory Tract Infections ', ' Respiratory Infections ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Azithromycin ', ' Azadose ', ' Azitrocin ', ' Azythromycin ', ' Ultreon ', ' Zithromax ', ' Zitromax ', ' Antibiotic Resistance ', ' Resistance to antibiotics ', ' Resistant to antibiotics ', ' antibiotic drug resistance ', ' antibiotic resistant ', ' Clavulanate ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' insight ', ' beta-Lactams ', ' β-Lactams ', ' Exposure to ', ' Antibiotic Treatment ', ' bacterial disease treatment ', ' bacterial infectious disease treatment ', ' Antibiotic Therapy ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' anti-microbial agent ', ' anti-microbial drug ', ' antimicrobial agent ', ' antimicrobial drug ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' novel ', ' Watchful Waiting ', ' Patient observation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' antibiotic resistant bacteria ', ' bacterial antibiotic resistant ', ' bacterial resistance to antibiotic ', ' Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Antimicrobial resistant ', ' Resistance to antimicrobial ', ' anti-microbial resistance ', ' anti-microbial resistant ', ' resistance to anti-microbial ', ' resistant to anti-microbial ', ' resistant to antimicrobial ', ' Antimicrobial Resistance ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Invaded ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' microbiome ', ' Human Microbiome ', ' human-associated microbiome ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' nanopore ', ' nano pore ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' 3-D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3D structure ', ' prospective ', ' antimicrobial ', ' anti-microbial ', ' Microbe ', ' metagenomic sequencing ', ' metagenome sequencing ', ' clinical care ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' IRB ', ' IRBs ', ' resistance gene ', ' resistance locus ', ' resistant gene ', ' predictive marker ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' treatment group ', ' gut microbiome ', ' GI microbiome ', ' digestive tract microbiome ', ' enteric microbiome ', ' gastrointestinal microbiome ', ' gut-associated microbiome ', ' intestinal biome ', ' intestinal microbiome ', ' treatment choice ', ' Preventive measure ', ' Preventative measure ', ' recruit ', ' microbiome research ', ' Microbiomics ', ' microbiome science ', ' microbiome studies ', ' treatment arm ', ' intervention arm ', ' gut colonization ', ' GI colonization ', ' gastrointestinal tract colonization ', ' intestinal colonization ', ' fecal microbiome ', ' stool microbiome ', ' stool-associated microbiome ', ' colonization resistance ', ' stool sample ', ' stool specimen ', ' microbiome alteration ', ' alter microbiome ', ' microbiome adaptation ', ' microbiome perturbation ', ' emerging antimicrobial resistance ', ' anti-microbial resistance emergence ', ' antimicrobial resistance emergence ', ' emerging anti-microbial resistance ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' ']",NIAID,"J.

"Validation of Physiologic CPR Quality Using NOn-inVasive Waveform Analytics (CPR-NOVA) Project Abstract  Pediatric cardiac arrest affects thousands of children each year. Progressive heart and lung failure is a predisposing cause in many of these events. Despite improvements in survival outcomes over the past two decades, more than half of these children still do not survive. As new brain injury complicates care among survivors, the burden to these children and the public's health is substantial.  Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) – the medical procedure of providing chest compressions and ventilations during cardiac arrest – saves lives, and higher quality CPR is more effective at doing so. One method to improve CPR quality is through the use of CPR quality monitoring defibrillators. By providing real- time feedback on CPR mechanics targets such as chest compression depth and rate, they represent the best patient care option currently available to improve CPR performance. Unfortunately, most of these devices are either not approved for children or use pads that are too large for many pediatric patients. Thus, current technology limits the benefit of meaningful CPR quality monitoring to a small percentage of the children who suffer a cardiac arrest. Given the strong association between pediatric CPR quality and outcomes, new methods to monitor CPR quality are urgently needed to improve the care of this vulnerable population.  Physiologic-directed CPR is a promising technique that uses the hemodynamic response of the patient to guide the ongoing resuscitation effort. This approach overcomes the technological limitations of existing CPR quality monitoring technology by using data from patient monitors. Unfortunately, because many patients do not have intra-arterial lines in place at the time of arrest to guide CPR, its clinical impact has been limited. To overcome this limitation, the objective of this ancillary application is to leverage the existing infrastructure of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development-funded Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network (CPCCRN) and the unique hemodynamic waveform database of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-funded parent R01 – the ICU-Resuscitation (ICU-RESUS) Project – to validate two noninvasive physiologic CPR monitors applicable to nearly every pediatric cardiac arrest: 1) end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2); and 2) PhotoPlethysmoGraphy (PPG) obtained via pulse oximetry. Using sophisticated machine learning methods, a prospective observational analytic investigation is proposed with the following Aims: 1) Evaluate ETCO2 as a noninvasive CPR quality monitor among children receiving at least 1 minute of CPR in a CPCCRN intensive care unit; and 2) Using novel machine learning classification algorithms, evaluate PPG and other candidate physiologic waveforms as noninvasive CPR quality monitors.  By leveraging the substantial infrastructure of the CPCCRN, the novel hemodynamic waveform database of ICU-RESUS, and advanced machine learning analytics, this submission represents a unique opportunity to validate two noninvasive physiologic pediatric CPR quality monitors to improve clinical care and save lives. !

"Interictal High Frequency Oscillations of Epileptogenecity in Pediatric Patients Project Summary Crucial to the success of epilepsy surgery is the availability of a robust presurgical biomarker to identify the epileptogenic zone (EZ). Complete resection of the EZ may lead to medication and seizure freedom. Since the EZ cannot be measured directly, its location is estimated indirectly based on concordant data from a multitude of noninvasive tests. Yet, the results of these tests are often insufficiently concordant or inconclusive. Intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) serves as the gold standard for the delineation of the seizure onset zone (SOZ). However, the SOZ does not always predict the surgical outcome, and its delineation requires many days of recordings to capture clinical seizures. High-frequency oscillations (HFOs), recorded with iEEG are promising interictal biomarkers of the EZ. Yet, their clinical value for epilepsy surgery is still debated since the HFO-generating area is often relatively large and its complete resection may overlap with eloquent areas. This is often attributed to the presence of physiological HFOs in non-epileptogenic areas. In our recent iEEG study, we showed that interictal HFOs are initiated by an onset generator and spread to other brain areas over time. This generator constitutes a promising interictal biomarker of the EZ since its resection is associated with good surgical outcome. Despite the copious literature on HFOs, the clinical value of HFOs for surgery has been only investigated using iEEG, which presents serious limitations due to its invasiveness and its limited spatial sampling. This application aims to noninvasively localize interictal HFOs with high-density electroencephalography (HD-EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) in children with medically refractory epilepsy (MRE), distinguish pathological from physiological HFOs, and assess the noninvasive localization of the HFO-onset generator with respect to the surgical resection and patients’ outcome. Our hypothesis is that HD-EEG and MEG can distinguish pathological from physiological HFOs non-invasively and can localize the HFO-onset generator whose removal leads to better surgical outcome than the removal of the area of secondary spread. To test our hypothesis, we specifically aim to: (i) assess the ability of HD-EEG and MEG to localize HFOs; (ii) differentiate physiological (nHFOs) from pathological (pHFOs) HFOs using unsupervised machine learning; (iii) localize noninvasively the HFO-onset generator and compare it with the clinical gold standard for resection tailoring, i.e. the iEEG-defined SOZ; and (iv) assess the predictive value of the HFO- onset generator in terms of surgical outcome. To pursue these aims, we will record HD-EEG and MEG data from 50 children (0-18 years old) with MRE and 50 typically developing (TD) children. This application combines the use of cutting-edge pediatric neuroimaging instruments, 3D printing technology, and innovative signal processing tools together with extensive neuroimaging experience with children. Our research will have a direct impact on the life of children with MRE since it will provide a new noninvasive biomarker of the EZ that would limit invasive long-term monitoring, augment presurgical planning, and improve the surgical outcome. Narrative To lessen the negative impact of medically refractory epilepsy in children, a new pre-surgical noninvasive biomarker that identifies reliably the area of the brain that generates the epileptic seizures is essential. The proposed experiments are relevant to public health because they may lead to a significant improvement of the presurgical evaluation procedure and postsurgical outcome of pediatric patients with refractory epilepsy. The project is relevant to NINDS’s mission because the resulting findings could significantly improve the quality of life in children with epilepsy, one of the most common pediatric neurological disorders, which has a major impact on children’s development and may significantly affect their adult life.",Interictal High Frequency Oscillations of Epileptogenecity in Pediatric Patients,9944685,R01NS104116,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Child Development ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Gold ', ' Head ', ' High Frequency Oscillation ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Magnetoencephalography ', ' MEG imaging ', ' magnetoencephalographic imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' neurosurgery ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Seizures ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Spatial Distribution ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Life ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Test Result ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Sampling ', ' Refractory epilepsy ', ' drug-resistant epilepsy ', ' Intractable Epilepsy ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Resected ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ', ' NINDS ', ' National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke ', ' Outcome ', ' blind ', ' visual motor ', ' visuomotor ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' 18 year old ', ' 18 years of age ', ' age 18 years ', ' eighteen year old ', ' eighteen years of age ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' 3D Print ', ' 3-D print ', ' 3-D printer ', ' 3D printer ', ' 3D printing ', ' three dimensional printing ', ' signal processing ', ' pediatric patients ', ' child patients ', ' improved outcome ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' surgery outcome ', ' surgical outcome ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' ']",NINDS,COOK CHILDREN'S MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,428636,TX-12
"Computational Models for the Prediction and Prevention of Child Traumatic Stress - Resubmission - 1 Project Summary/Abstract At least 40% of children will experience a traumatic event. Of those who experience a trauma, 15-40% will develop Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and other adverse psychiatric, health, and functional outcomes (herein called Child Traumatic Stress - CTS). Despite decades of research on risk factors for CTS, the field has not arrived at specific risk factor models that can accurately predict the likelihood of CTS outcomes or identify factors that – if changed – would change their likelihood. Knowledge about changes in factors that result in changes in outcomes is, by definition, causal. The vast majority of findings in the literature on risk for CTS cannot provide such causal knowledge because such findings were based on the application of correlational methods to observational data. Experimental research cannot – for all practical purposes - be conducted for human research on risk for CTS. Thus, the field is left with correlational observational research as the near exclusive generator of empirical knowledge on risk for CTS, and such knowledge is unsuitable to guide the actions (i.e. interventions) that must be taken to change children's likelihood of acquiring CTS outcomes. We propose to address this considerable barrier to progress by applying methods that can enable confident causal inference with large observational data sets containing a broad diversity of risk variables for CTS. Machine Learning (ML) predictive and causal modeling methods will be applied to discover causal relationships among measured variables from observational data: and from such determined causal relationships, to estimate the effect on a CTS outcome when a causal variable is manipulated (i.e. intervention simulation). We will build models for outcomes associated with childhood trauma in the literature and that entail significant burden to children's well-being, functioning, and development: PTSD, Depression, Substance Abuse, Health, and Educational Performance. Project Narrative This application proposes research to apply an array of powerful and innovative computational methods – well validated in other fields – to advance the capacity to predict and prevent traumatic stress in children and adolescents. These methods will be applied to several highly relevant, existing data sets that cover diverse populations of traumatized youth and with diverse data collection designs. The data sets and the analytic methodologies have been carefully selected to advance knowledge related to prediction, discovery of causal mechanisms, and the identification of promising preventative interventions for child traumatic stress.",Computational Models for the Prediction and Prevention of Child Traumatic Stress - Resubmission - 1,10206005,R01MH119114,"['Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Child Welfare ', ' adolescent welfare ', ' child well being ', ' child wellbeing ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Collection ', ' Decision Trees ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Genotype ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Parents ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Research ', ' Retrospective Studies ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' post-trauma stress disorder ', ' posttrauma stress disorder ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dependence ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' abuse of substances ', ' substance abuse ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' intervention for prevention ', ' prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' preventive intervention ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Cognitive ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' pediatric trauma ', ' adolescent trauma ', ' childhood trauma ', ' trauma in children ', ' computerized ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' traumatized children ', ' Child Traumatic Stress ', ' childhood traumatic stress ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Trauma ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' 18 year old ', ' 18 years of age ', ' age 18 years ', ' eighteen year old ', ' eighteen years of age ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' traumatic event ', ' causal model ', ' causal diagram ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' preservation ', ' personalized predictions ', ' Individualized Predictors ', ' individualized predictions ', ' personalized predictors ', ' trauma exposure ', ' exposure to trauma ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' traumatic stress ', ' diverse data ', ' data diversity ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,604345,NY-12
"Predicting Heterogeneous Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in School-age Children with Early Caregiving Adversities Project Summary Children with severe Early Caregiving Adversities (ECAs) are the most vulnerable to psychopathology as a result of prolonged neglect, abuse, and care disruptions that impact neurodevelopment. It is currently estimated that addressing ECAs would lead to a 29.8% reduction in worldwide psychiatric illness. Existing research, including findings from the original grant of this renewal, has demonstrated that there is a very strong link between ECA exposures and increased risk for psychopathology and altered neurodevelopment at the population level; and yet, given the heterogeneity in ECA populations, there is a critical gap in knowledge regarding how ECAs increase any specific risks to an individual child. The proposed research addresses this significant mental health problem by combining sophisitcated data-analysis methods that use experiential and phenotypic heterogeneity together with longitudinal neuroimaging and behavioral assessments in school-age children. This approach will increase precision when linking ECAs and child outcomes associated with the Research Domain Criteria constructs of Negative Valence and Cognitive Control Systems (NVS/CCS). The overarching goal of the present work is to create an explanatory model for the heterogeneous impact of ECAs on neurodevelopmental trajectories of NVS/CCS. This project's premise is that children exposed to ECAs have highly heterogeneous developmental histories as well as heterogeneous outcomes; therefore, prediction of ECA outcomes requires cutting-edge, sophisticated data analytic methods. We hypothesize that data-driven approaches will 1) more precisely define NVS/CCS outcomes for school-aged children with ECAs, and 2) provide a more robust explanatory model for links between ECAs and NVS/CCS trajectories. Aim 1A subtypes children with a history of ECAs based on 2.5-year developmental trajectories of NVS/CCS. 300 6-8 year old children (250 sampled from previous institutional and foster care; 50 community comparisons) will provide neuroimaging, behavioral, and self/caregiver reports every 15 months for 2.5 years. Biclustering methods will be applied to the baseline and follow-up data to identify homogeneous NVS/CCS final outcome clusters of children. Aim 1B develops an explanatory model to predict developmental trajectory subtypes for children with ECAs, from early life profiles and brain/behavior phenotypes at the time of enrollment. Machine learning methods applied to early life profiles, baseline NVS/CCS profiles, and sex, will predict developmental trajectory subtypes. Aim 2 identifies adverse and protective life events during the 2.5-year assessment period that are predictive of 2.5-year follow-up outcomes for children with ECAs. The inclusion of child-sex and current life- events will identify potential divergence in pathways across middle childhood. This prospective design of children exposed to various ECAs is designed to develop predictive models for ECA trajectory subtypes and outcomes, which can inform our understanding of risk and protective factors in accord with the goals of precision medicine.   Project Narrative Children with severe Early Caregiving Adversities (ECAs) are the most vulnerable to psychopathology, and it is estimated that addressing ECAs would lead to a 29.8% reduction in worldwide psychiatric illness.

"Development of a novel mobile health tool for age-specific dehydration assessment and management in patients with diarrheal disease Project Summary Diarrheal diseases lead to an estimated 2.4 billion episodes of illness and 1.3 million deaths each year, with the majority of those deaths occurring in adults, adolescents, and children over five years. As the severity of diarrheal diseases can vary widely, accurately assessing dehydration status remains the most crucial step in preventing morbidity and mortality. While patients with severe dehydration require hospital admission and immediate resuscitation with intravenous fluids to prevent hemodynamic compromise, organ ischemia, and death, those with mild to moderate dehydration can be treated in outpatient settings with relatively inexpensive oral rehydration solution. Yet, while several tools have been validated for use in children under five years of age, no clinical diagnostic tool has ever been validated for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults, adolescents or children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. Differences in both adult physiology and diarrhea etiology may compromise the accuracy of clinical diagnostic models developed for use in young children. The proposed research will derive the very first age-specific clinical diagnostic models created for the assessment of dehydration status in patients over five years of age with acute diarrhea, incorporate those models into a new mobile health (mHealth) tool, and validate the performance of this tool in a new population of patients with acute diarrhea. To accomplish this task, we will enroll a prospective cohort of adults and children over five years of age with acute diarrhea presenting to the rehydration unit of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) in Dhaka, Bangladesh and collect data on presenting clinical signs and symptoms shown to correlate with dehydration severity in prior studies. We will then employ machine learning techniques to derive age-specific clinical diagnostic models for assessing dehydration in patients over five years of age with acute diarrhea. We will conduct formative research among clinicians working at icddr,b to develop an innovative mobile phone based platform which will incorporate these new age-specific diagnostic models for rapid use by frontline health workers. Finally, we will validate both the accuracy and reliability of the newly developed mHealth tool in a new population of adults and children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. Once developed and properly validated, this novel mHealth tool has the potential to help physicians, nurses, and other healthcare providers more accurately diagnose dehydration severity and better determine the optimal management strategy for patients with acute diarrhea. Improved diagnostic approaches may in turn be shown to reduce both the morbidity and mortality that occurs as a result of missed diagnoses of dehydration, as well as the adverse events and inappropriate utilization of limited healthcare resources that can result from inaccurate diagnoses of dehydration. Project Narrative Dehydration due to diarrheal diseases remains a leading cause of death in both children and adults worldwide, yet no clinical tools have ever been validated for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults or children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. The proposed research will both develop and validate an innovative new mobile phone based platform for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults, adolescents, and older children with acute diarrhea. This new mobile health tool will help physicians, nurses, and other providers worldwide to determine the best management strategies for patients with acute diarrhea, potentially improving and rationalizing care for the hundreds of millions of patients each year presenting to healthcare facilities around the world with acute diarrhea.",Development of a novel mobile health tool for age-specific dehydration assessment and management in patients with diarrheal disease,10202572,R01DK116163,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', ' Bangladesh ', ' Beds ', ' Body Weight Changes ', ' Weight Change ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Dehydration ', ' body water dehydration ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diarrhea ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' care facilities ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Inpatients ', ' Ischemia ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Physiology ', ' Rehydrations ', ' Rehydration Solutions ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resuscitation ', ' Signs and Symptoms ', ' Diagnostic Findings ', ' Work ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Measures ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Ensure ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' International Unit ', ' Severities ', ' Oral ', ' Techniques ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' international center ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' Provider ', ' Intravenous Fluid ', ' IV Fluid ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' 5 year old ', ' 5 years of age ', ' age 5 years ', ' five year old ', ' five years of age ', ' usability ', ' patient population ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' clinical predictors ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' LMIC ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' clinical diagnostics ', ' Acute Diarrhea ', ' diarrheal disease ', ' diarrheal illness ', ' clinical examination ', ' clinical exam ', ' ']",NIDDK,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,R01,2021,546783,RI-01
"Using Machine Learning to Predict Clinical Deterioration in Hospitalized Children PROJECT SUMMARY Children who are admitted to the hospital and experience deterioration have a high risk of mortality and poor long-term health. Current warning early scores indicating risk of deterioration are subjectively derived and have not reduced in-hospital mortality. In recent work, I developed a vital sign based statistical model that demonstrated improved accuracy over current risk scores at predicting clinical deterioration in hospitalized children 24 hours in advance. Within adults, the combination of longitudinal data analysis techniques, machine learning, and electronic health record (EHR) data have led to highly accurate early warning scores. Therefore, my aim in this grant proposal is to utilize longitudinal integration of EHR data in a machine learning framework to develop a model for predicting clinical deterioration in hospitalized children as early as possible. I will do this by first deriving and validating a prediction model using structured EHR data collected from three pediatric hospitals (Aim 1). Using the same cohort, I will then build and validate a prediction model using features derived from unstructured clinical notes (Aim 2). I will also compare if the addition of unstructured features improves the prediction accuracy of the model derived in Aim 1. Finally, I will determine the association between non-patient level environmental variables within the hospital ecosystem and risk of clinical deterioration in hospitalized children (Aim 3). I will also determine if the addition of these environmental risk factors improves performance of the prediction model derived through Aims 1 and 2. Completion of this proposal will result in a validated pediatric risk prediction model that will enable clinicians to recognize early signs of deterioration in hospitalized children. This will facilitate timely intervention, thereby saving lives and improving long-term health. In addition, this grant will also provide me with crucial data for a future R01 trial aimed at assessing the impact of the prediction model in reducing mortality, decreasing costs, and improving long-term outcomes in hospitalized children. To establish myself as an independent investigator in pediatric prediction modeling, I propose a training plan that includes comprehensive didactics and mentorship in the areas of longitudinal data analysis, advanced machine learning, natural language processing, and concepts in pediatric care. I have assembled a first-class mentorship team comprised of national experts in longitudinal data analysis techniques and EHR-based machine learning (Robert Gibbons PhD and Matthew Churpek MD, PhD). My advisory team is comprised of experts in natural language processing (Dmitriy Dligach PhD), clinical decision support around deterioration events (Dana Edelson MD, MS and Priti Jani MD), and pediatric early warning scores (Christopher Parshuram MB., ChB., D. Phil., FRACP). By completing my research and career development goals, I will develop into an independent expert investigator in developing pediatric prediction models for ultimately improving outcomes in hospitalized children. PROJECT NARRATIVE Clinical deterioration in hospitalized children is associated with high-risk of mortality as well as complications in their long-term health. An improved prediction model capable of identifying pediatric patients at risk of clinical deterioration as early as possible can facility timely and proper intervention, thereby decreasing preventable death and improving long-term outcomes in hospitalized children.",Using Machine Learning to Predict Clinical Deterioration in Hospitalized Children,10171893,K01HL148390,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Chicago ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Hospitalized Child ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Heart Arrest ', ' Asystole ', ' Cardiac Arrest ', ' Hospitals ', ' Pediatric Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Hylobates Genus ', ' Gibbons ', ' Hylobates ', ' Nomascus ', ' Symphalangus ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Maps ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' mortality ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' Publishing ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Savings ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Hospital Mortality ', ' In-house Mortalities ', ' Inhospital Mortality ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Hospitalization cost ', ' Training ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Early Intervention ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Cardiopulmonary ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Modality ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' ward ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' Detection ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' Neurological outcome ', ' Neurologic outcome ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' high risk ', ' control trial ', ' electronic structure ', ' clinical risk ', ' clinical predictors ', ' pediatric patients ', ' child patients ', ' improved outcome ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' clinical decision support ', ' preventable death ', ' preventable mortality ', ' risk prediction model ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' unstructured data ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K01,2021,7558,IL-01
"Parsing early emerging heterogeneity related to autism spectrum disorder A major impediment to early identification and intervention for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is our limited understanding of how different children present signs as toddlers, including what risk symptoms coincide across multiple dimensions to predict outcome. Our objectives are to quantify behavioral and brain connectivity based subtypes of risk that model the variability of ASD symptom expression in a community sample of toddlers. We will then test the predictive validity of this approach in the same cohort of children at three years of age in order to identify risk profiles that differentially predict later cognitive, behavioral, and clinical features. First, we will implement two unsupervised data-driven computational approaches in a community sample of 3000 children between 18-24 months old in order to characterize clusters of risk profiles. We hypothesize that each approach will identify a proportion of high-risk individuals consistent with epidemiological estimates of ASD and associated developmental disabilities (e.g., language or global DD). Based on our preliminary data, we anticipate that ~300 children will be identified by these data-driven risk-profiling methods. We also hypothesize that distinct patterns of structural and functional connectivity will distinguish groups of at-risk children and that these groups will differ from low-risk children. All children will be scanned with the same brain imaging sequences and procedures implemented in the Baby Connectome Project and will be compared to data from 100 low-risk children from that project. Our neuroimaging sample of 300 children will be reassessed at age three with direct clinical assessment using gold-standard diagnostic instruments as well as parent report. This will allow us to validate the risk profiling approach implemented at 18-24 months, to compare with a current screening approach, and to refine the risk profiling approach with supervised training of prediction algorithms that incorporates behavioral/clinical outcome data. We expect this method for risk stratification/subtyping to better model the heterogeneity inherent to the early at-risk and resilient phenotypes, which will subsequently improve early identification/diagnosis efforts. These outcomes will have translational impact because improved methods for early identification in ASD are necessary for the successful development of efficacious, personalized early interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Symptoms of autism present differently in toddlers, which makes it difficult to identify children at risk during their first two years of life. Our goal is to measure variation in behavior and brain functioning in this age that may predict differing clinical outcomes.

"Harnessing multimodal data to enhance machine learning of children’s vocalizations Project Summary This Administrative Supplement proposes implementation of a multimodal data pipeline to support machine learning of child language production in complex naturalistic environments. The Supplement builds on the parent R01 (DC018542) that gathers objective, longitudinal data to capture the vocal interactions of children with hearing loss (HL). Even with cochlear implantation, HL is a life-altering condition with high social costs. Inclusion of children with HL and typically hearing (TH) peers in preschool classrooms is a national standard, but it is not clear how early vocal interaction contributes to the language development of children with HL and their TH peers. The parent R01 employs computational models of child location and orientation to indicate when children are in social contact with their peers and teachers. An additional strategy for pursuing the broad goals of the R01— identifying interactive contexts in which children produce phonemically complex vocalizations and interactive speech—is machine learning. Machine learning algorithms can determine the contextual, individual, and interactive factors that predict children’s vocalizations and vocal interactions. However, the parent R01 does not propose machine learning, nor are data disseminated in a format designed to facilitate machine learning. To facilitate machine learning in the classroom, a rigorous diarization process is required to determine speaker identity, which is operationalized as the likelihood that each vocalization was spoken by a given child or teacher. We will integrate audio processing of each target child and teacher’s first-person audio recording with processing of their interactive partners’ recordings. The influence of partner recordings will be determined by their physical distance and orientation relative to the target. This will yield a weighted speaker identification score for each vocalization. For 25% of the sample, the algorithmic score will be compared to speaker identification provided by trained coders to quantify intersystem reliability. Processed datasets will include 7,160 hours of multimodal recordings of child and teacher movement in classrooms synchronized with continuously recorded, child- and teacher-specific (first-person) audio recordings. De-identified output data will characterize vocalizations with respect to algorithmically computed speaker identification probabilities, coder-identified speaker identity (25% of sample), phonemic complexity and audio characteristics (e.g., fundamental frequency), as well as the position and relative orientation of all individuals in the classroom, and child demographics (including characterizations of HL). Over the course of the supplement, output data, Python processing code, and metadata descriptions of the processing pipeline will be disseminated in dedicated distribution portals including Github, Kaggle, and the UCI repository. Recordings will be released to certified investigators via NIH-funded repositories such as Databrary and Homebank. Overview. The current Administrative Supplement proposes implementation of a multimodal data processing pipeline to produce data ready for machine learning (ML). The Supplement is a response to NOT-OD-21-094 which calls for sharing “data generated through NIH-funded research” in ML-ready form. Disseminated data will facilitate the ML detection of child vocalizations and the prediction of child vocalizations in a complex natural context. The Supplement builds on parent grant (R01DC018542), which gathers intensive longitudinal data to capture the vocal interactions of children with hearing loss (HL) in preschool classrooms. The proposed supplement pipeline will integrate multi-source, multimodal objective recordings to computationally identify when children are vocalizing, compare those results to trained coders, and release all data, code, and metadata to enhance machine learning of child speech. Parent R01 premise. The parent R01 uses objectively measured, longitudinal data to capture the vocal interactions of children with hearing loss (HL) in order to understand everyday factors that facilitate their language development. HL, including deafness, is associated with delays and difficulties in social and language development. Even with cochlear implantation (CI), HL is a life-altering condition with high social costs. Inclusion of children with HL and typically hearing (TH) peers in preschool classrooms is a national standard, but it is not clear how day-to-day interactions contribute to the language development of these children. The R01 premise, supported by the team's ongoing research data, holds that vocal interactions with peers and teachers in inclusive classrooms positively influence the language development of both children with and without HL (Fasano et al., 2021; Perry et al., 2019; Perry et al., 2018). Parent R01 objective data collection. Temporally intensive, objective measurements of child and teacher movement in classrooms are synchronized with automated analysis of continuously recorded, child-specific audio recordings. First-person audio and radio frequency identification (RFID) of location and orientation occur twice a month. In the classroom, children are outfitted with specially-designed lightweight vests (and teachers are outfitted with fanny packs) containing two Ubisense RFID tags (left and right, to detect both location and orientation) and a LENA first person audio recorder when they arrive at preschool. Using multiple sensors (radio cells) linked by a timing cable, the RFID Ubisense system can track up to 40 participants 4 times per second to an accuracy of 15cm in classrooms of up to 8m * 8m * 2.5m dimensions (Woźniak et al., 2013). Sensors track active tags worn by children (and teachers) in XYZ space by means of triangulation (angle of arrival, AoA) and time differences in arrival (TDoA). As part of Supplement preprocessing, a Multiplicative Extended Kalman Filter (MEKF) based filter (Sabatini, 2006) will be applied to de-noise the raw child and teacher position and orientation data (Crassidis et al., 2007). R01 overall goal. The overall goal of both the R01 and the Supplement involves identifying contexts in which children produce vocalizations, particularly phonemically complex vocalizations. The premise is that children's vocalizations create opportunities for both direct feedback (producing and hearing one's vocalizations) as well as interactive feedback from peers and teachers (Fusaroli et al., 2019; Hirsh- Pasek et al., 2015; Ribot et al., 2018). In support of this premise, the team's ongoing research indicates that both the overall quantity (rate per minute) of children's vocalizations, and the phonemic complexity of those vocalizations (the mean number of unique speech sounds per vocalization) are associated with children's assessed receptive and expressive language abilities (Altman et al., 2020; Fasano et al., 2021; Perry et al., 2019; Perry et al., 2018). R01 approach. The parent R01 does not propose or utilize machine learning. Instead, the R01 tests a priori hypotheses to predict child vocalizations. Specifically, the parent R01 investigates whether exposure to peer and teacher vocalizations during periods of social contact longitudinally predicts higher levels of vocalizations to those partners. Exposure to more responsive partner vocalizations and more phonemically complex vocalizations is hypothesized to yield higher rates of more phonemically complex child vocalizations. Computational modeling of children's physical location and interpersonal orientation within classrooms indicate when children are in social contact with peers and teachers. Although social contact is computed from observed data in the parent R01, it is derived exclusively from physical proximity and orientation. The empirical relationship between social proximity, social orientation, and vocalization production and vocal interactions is not known. Supplement-enabled approach (machine learning). Machine learning is a complementary approach to the broader R01 goal of identifying factors that foster language production. Machine learning offers data-driven opportunities to discover both expected and unexpected associations that support child vocalizations and language development. Machine learning refers to algorithms that iteratively represent data in a more abstract form to identify patterns of interest. These algorithms frequently capitalize on nonlinear associations between large sets of predictor variables to learn patterns in real- world data (LeCun et al., 2015). Value of machine learning of Supplement data. The Supplement will pave the way for the application of supervised machine learning approaches to predict the conditions when children speak and the complexity of the speech they produce. Moreover, machine learning can be used to predict children's vocal interactions with both children and teachers, which appear to facilitate language development (Perry et al., 2018; Romeo et al., 2018; Weisleder & Fernald, 2013). Machine learning can discover temporal, contextual, and individual interactive factors predicting vocalizations and vocal interactions.  Temporal and dynamic factors. Temporal features of a child's vocalization stream are likely to  condition the likelihood of subsequent vocalizing; that is, children frequently generate successive  vocalizations in close temporal proximity to one another (Abney et al., 2017). Likewise, the velocity  of children's movement (and their relative velocity with respect to partners) are dynamic features that  may be associated with the likelihood of vocalizations. Machine learning allows for the integration of  such temporal and dynamic features into detection and prediction algorithms.  Contextual and group factors. Contextual factors include classroom activities (e.g., circle time and  free play) that are annotated as part of the parent R01. A potential machine learning goal is  identification of classroom activities from the movement and orientation of children and teachers in  the class (activity recognition). Classroom activities, in turn, may condition nonlinear associations  between predictors. When children are shoulder-to-shoulder (rather than face-to-face) they may be  likely to respond to one another's vocalizations, but only when their physical movement is diminished  such as when they are sitting next to one another during small group activities. Likewise, the parent  R01 is limited to analyzing group interactions as a series of dyadic interactions while machine  learning approaches can leverage nonlinear changes in vocalization propensity associated with  group size.  Individual factors. Children with hearing loss (HL) exhibit delayed and variable language  development, which is associated with functional outcomes (Geers et al., 2016; Koehlinger et al.,  2013; Spencer et al., 2003). Importantly, children with HL are responsive to enriched language  environments (Cruz et al., 2013). The parent R01 investigates whether hearing loss (HL vs TH) and  hearing age influence associations between speech in social contact and speech production using  planned contrasts in multivariate statistical models. By contrast, machine learning approaches have  the potential to identify both similarities and differences in the contextual features that support the  vocalizations of children with HL and typical hearing. Children with HL, for example, may benefit  disproportionately from vocalizations from partners who are directly in front of them. Supplement datasets. The Supplement will process two multimodal datasets (first-person audio and synchronized RFID position/orientation information) from a multiethnic sample of children with hearing loss (HL) and typical hearing (TH). The datasets involve multiple (monthly and bimonthly, respectively) multi-hour recordings totaling 7,160 hours. Preliminary Dataset: 716 multimodal recordings of 82 children (44 HL and 38 TH) and 16 teachers comprising 2,360 hours of data collected prior to and in the first months of the parent R01. Supplement Dataset. 960 multimodal recordings of 40 children (24 HL and 16 TH) and 8 teachers comprising 4,800 hours of data to be gathered during the Supplement period (10/1/21 - 9/30/22). Finally, to enhance impact, the pipeline will be utilized after the Supplement period over the remainder of the Parent R01 to include an additional 85 children (31 HL, 54 TH) and 12 teachers, producing an additional 3,840 multimodal recordings with a combined duration of 19,200 hours. The Supplement's sequential processing and release of multiple datasets will allow for tests of the generalizability of machine learning models. Supplement team expertise. The collaborative project team possesses ample expertise to carry out supplement activities. MPI Messinger has employed computer vision of facial movement (Martin et al., 2018; Messinger et al., 2009; Messinger et al., 2012), signal processing of vocalizations (Esposito et al., 2014), and automated tracking of children's classroom movement (Messinger et al., 2019) in over a dozen years of funded research. MPI Perry is a language development researcher who employs first- person audio recordings to study children's language development in children's classroom environments (Altman et al., 2020; Perry et al., 2019; Perry et al., 2018). Consultant Narayan is an expert on audio processing and multimodal data integration whose extensive research portfolio has generated a broad array of publications, tools, data, patents and system prototypes (Lahiri et al., 2020; Pal et al., 2021). Supplement approach. To facilitate machine learning in the classroom, a rigorous diarization process is required to determine speaker identity. Determining speaker identity in naturalistic environments remains a challenge, particularly when some or all speakers are children. We operationalize speaker identity as the likelihood that each vocalization was articulated by a given child or teacher. In the Parent R01, speaker identity is determined by LENA diarization of the target child's first person audio recording. In the Supplement, speaker identity is determined by diarization of the target child's first person audio recording in conjunction with diarization of the first person audio recording of the target child's partners (peers and teachers). The relative weight accorded to the diarizations of the target child's partners is determined by their distance from and orientation to the target child. The distance between the target child and their partners, as well as their relative orientation, is provided by synchronized RFID position and orientation information of all children and teachers in the classroom. Speaker identification based on interpersonal distance and orientation. We will integrate audio diarization of each target child recording with diarization of their respective interactive partners as determined by the physical distance and relative orientation of the target and partner. Children serve iteratively as targets and peers in data processing. To determine the weighting function of a partner we calculate their distance to the target and the target and partner interpersonal orientations. An exponential function decreases weight (𝑤) proportional to the square of the distance between the target child and partner (peer or teacher) and their interpersonal angular difference from face-to-face contact as follows:  𝑤ሺ𝑟, 𝜃ଵ, 𝜃ଶሻ ൌ 𝑒𝑥𝑝ሺെ𝑟ଶ/2𝜎௥ଶ െ 𝜃ଵଶ/2𝜎ఏଶ െ 𝜃ଶଶ/2𝜎ఏଶሻ , (1) where the radius 𝑟 ൌ ඥሺ𝑥ଵ െ 𝑥ଶሻଶ ൅ ሺ𝑦ଵ െ 𝑦ଶሻଶ represents the distance between pairs of individuals, and 𝜃1 and 𝜃2 are their respective orientations toward one another (interpersonal orientations). A distance of 1 meters and an interpersonal orientation of 15 degree are used as arbitrary scaling factors (σr = 2m and σθ =15o). Thus the weight (influence) of peer recordings rises as the distance between the peer and the target decreases, and as their orientation becomes more face-to-face (see Figure 1). This procedure yields weighted speaker identification likelihoods for each vocalization. Both likelihood scores and a winner-takes-all vocalizer will be reported continuously in time for each audio recording. Figure 1. Data processing pipeline. The figure illustrates proposed dataflow using an exemplar Target child, a peer (Peer1), and a teacher. Children serve as both targets and peers in data processing. Pairs of RFID sensors worn by each participant illustrate their relative distance and interpersonal orientation. First person LENA audio recordings of Target and Peer and diarization with the ALICE open-source DNN toolkit (overlapping speech is not shown). Note that Peer1 diarization of peer speech shortly before 54:56 increases the likelihood that the vocalization pertains to the Target. The continuous likelihood that a vocalization pertains to the target, a peer, or teacher is rendered (likelihoods are affected by a second peer who is not visualized). Expert rating of the Target recording—available for 25% of vocalizations—will be of particular value to ML researchers interested in child speech detection. Harnessing audio processing advances. The parent R01 uses LENA SP/Hub Version 3.4.0 proprietary software, which diarizes vocalizations with Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) trained on English input (Gilkerson & Richards, 2009; Xu et al., 2009). GMM and HMM are rarely employed in modern audio speech processing, however, having been supplanted by deep neural networks (DNNs) that recursively represent the raw audio signal at increasing levels of abstraction to identify speech and speakers (Pal et al., 2021). In the Supplement, audio recordings will be diarized using ALICE, an open-source, multi-language toolkit trained on multiple, first-person audio recording corpora from diverse linguistic and socioeconomic contexts (Räsänen et al., 2020). ALICE uses a series of DNNs (recurrent neural networks and a convolutional neural network) to identify and categorize (segment) speech as target child vocalizations, peer vocalizations, and adult vocalizations (Lavechin et al., 2020). In addition, we will characterize first person audio streams with mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) in Python and estimate the phonemic complexity (consonant and vowel sounds) of identified vocalizations using CMUSphinx (Walker et al., 2004) to enhance the value of disseminated data for machine learning research. Additional machine learning applications. For machine learning researchers investigating speech diarization the release of annotated audio recordings will be a major resource. The proposed multimethod, multimodal estimation of speaker identity, together with source audio (and movement) files, will facilitate machine learning research focused on improving speech detection and speaker identification (diarization) algorithms. The DNN diarization provided by ALICE will serve as baseline levels of speech detection and speaker identification while the provision of human reliability coding (annotations) will serve as a reliability benchmark. Reliability coding. To benchmark intersystem reliability, 25% of recordings will be annotated by one of 15 undergraduate coders trained to reliability—and regularly assessed for drift—by the project Research Associate. Coders will be randomly assigned 25% of each participant's first person audio recordings, which will allow them to become familiar with that speaker's vocalizations. Using ELAN (ELAN, 2019), coders will identify vocalizations and designate the speaker as Target, Peer, or Teacher. The team has experience with reliability coding in ELAN and preliminary data suggest the reliability of coders with LENA diarization (e.g., Cohen's Kappa = .77). Reliability of both speech detection and speaker designation between ALICE and trained coders will be assessed via Kappa, Diarization Error Rate, and Jaccard Error Rate (Fiscus et al., 2006; Ryant et al., 2019). Diversity, privacy, and consent. The makeup and demographic balance of the proposed datasets can contribute to reducing algorithmic bias. Preliminary and initial data indicate that the child and the teacher sample will be ethnically (50% Hispanic and 50% not Hispanic) and racially (23% Black [Caribbean and African American], 74% White, and 3% Asian) diverse. The child sex distribution is approximately 58% male while teachers are 90% female. In addition, the team is highly sensitive to issues of confidentiality. De-identified databases will be made publicly available; however, audio recordings will be made available only to certified investigators on portals employing 'walled garden' procedures such as Databrary. All participating parents explicitly consent to these procedures. Dissemination. Although the parent R01 is not designed to disseminate data in a ML-ready format, this is a central goal of the Supplement. The Supplement pipeline for producing the ML-ready de-identified dataset will be developed in Python, and include a loader to facilitate feeding data to deep learning frameworks, including PyTorch and Tensorflow. De-identified data will characterize vocalizations with respect to onsets and offsets, algorithmically computed speaker identification probabilities (and, for 25% of recordings, human coded speaker identification), MFCCs (including fundamental frequency, and intensity), phonemic complexity, the position and relative orientation of all individuals in the classroom, classroom activity codes (e.g., free play), and child demographics (including characterizations of HL). Python code, de-identified data in .csv format, and metadata descriptions of the data and processing pipeline will be disseminated via repositories including Github.com, Kaggle.com, the UCI Repository (archive.ics.uci.edu), and the Open Science Framework (osf.io). Synchronized source audio recordings (.wav files) along with de-identified data and metadata will be disseminated via NIH/NSF-funded repositories including Databrary.org and Homebank (homebank.talkbank.org).

"Investigating orthography-phonology and orthography-semantics pathways with implications for compensatory mechanisms in reading disorder in the context of a randomized control trial Project Summary/Abstract Decoding-based reading disorder (RD, also known as dyslexia), a neurodevelopmental disorder with difficulties in reading and spelling, affects approximately 3-10% of all children. Because RD leads to negative consequences beyond academic achievement such as poor mental health outcomes, identifying effective reading interventions is a high priority for researchers and educators. Currently, evidence-based multi-componential interventions that explicitly and systematically target phonics (PHON, focused on letter-sound matching) are considered most effective for remediating RD. However, up to 30% of RD children continue to struggle, warranting broader examination of interventions that goes beyond PHON. Emerging research suggests that morphology-based intervention (MORPH, focused on the understanding and identification of the structure of a word, such as word bases, prefixes, and affixes) may serve as an alternative and complementary strategy. This proposed project, leveraging a funded reading intervention program, will examine event-related potential (ERP)-based neural signals in relation to responsiveness to interventions (RTI) by drawing insights from a computational model of reading (i.e., the connectionist triangle model). Based on this model, we predict that PHON intervention primarily targets the orthography-phonology [O-P] pathway, and MORPH intervention primarily targets the orthography- semantics [O-S] pathway. We also predict that MORPH intervention promotes greater reading improvements for individuals who primarily rely on O-S (possibly compensatory) mechanisms to overcome their weakness in phonological processing. Specifically, this longitudinal project aims to address (1) whether children with RD who have enhanced O-S processes at baseline are more responsive to PHON and MORPH interventions, and whether such responsiveness will be greater if the approach emphasizes both O-S and O-P pathways as compared to the O-P pathway alone; (2) whether the MORPH intervention strengthens the representation of O- P and O-S pathways. We will examine ERP-based neural signals from a lexical task, collected 4 times over the course of 5-week intensive interventions (MORPH, PHON, Executive function [EF], and Math interventions). We will use machine learning and an individual difference approach to assess O-P and O-S neural signals and their trajectories over the course of intervention, and to understand the relationship between these neural signals and children’s RTI. This proposal will help us better understand factors that predict children’s RTI, and the mechanism of different reading interventions. This fellowship will provide crucial research and professional training opportunities to become an independent translational researcher. This includes gaining experience in designing and conducting randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and methodological training in EEG/ERP including machine learning and multilevel mixed modeling analytical techniques. This proposal also addresses her goal of generating scientific knowledge that can help better identify and intervene children with RD. Project Narrative  The potential impact of the project is substantial, as the findings will help us understand the characteristics of children with dyslexia that link to responsiveness to different interventions. Additionally, the findings will give insights into why some children continue to struggle with reading after interventions.

"A Machine Learning Approach to Predicting Iatrogenic Withdrawal in Critically-ill Children PROJECT ABSTRACT Iatrogenic withdrawal affects up to 57% of children who receive sedative and analgesic medications in the pediatric intensive care unit (ICU), contributing to delayed recovery, patient and parental distress and prolonged hospitalization in (an estimated) 70,000 children per year. Due to limitations in sample size and variable sets, studies on iatrogenic withdrawal in pediatric ICUs have primarily focused on the association of single risk factors, screening tools, and treatment regimens, without attention to early identification of at-risk children. This proposal will leverage a national, electronic health record derived database of over 200,000 pediatric ICU patients to investigate the full spectrum of risk factors, patient profiles, and practice patterns associated with iatrogenic withdrawal from sedatives and analgesic medications that could identify children at risk prior to withdrawal symptoms or early in their treatment course. I will achieve this by first identifying risk factors, patient profiles and practice patterns associated with iatrogenic withdrawal using traditional biostatistical techniques. Second, I will use the identified risk factors in addition to time dependent variables, such as vital signs and laboratory values, to develop a dynamic model to predict risk of developing iatrogenic withdrawal in pediatric ICU patients using novel supervised machine learning methodology. Third, I will externally validate the dynamic prediction model in a local dataset from my institution’s electronic health record to determine if the model can accurately predict those patients who develop clinically confirmed iatrogenic withdrawal. Successful completion of these aims will lead to the development of an analytical tool to identify iatrogenic withdrawal in children in ICUs using electronic-based resources which can be operationalized into clinical practice. The proposed studies are feasible because of 1) my strong and productive multi-disciplinary team of clinician and data science mentors who meet biweekly under the guidance of my mentorship team including Dr. Murray Pollack, a leader in the field of predictive modelling in pediatric critical care and Dr. Michael Bell, a national leader in neurocritical care, and 2) the recent availability of reliable, large, multi- institutional pediatric databases derived directly from the electronic health record (EHR). This K23 award proposal will also facilitate an integrated didactic and mentor-led experiential training program designed to develop and refine my knowledge and skills in big database research, predictive modelling, and morbidity associated with sedative and analgesic medication administration. The career development and research proposal will enable my long-term career goal, which is to become an independently funded clinical investigator focused on the prevention of healthcare-acquired morbidity through big data research and predictive analytics.

"Rehabilitation Engagement at Home with a socially Assistive roBot for Pediatric Adherence (REHAB-PAL) Project Summary/Abstract  Cerebral Palsy (CP) is the most common motor disorder and cause of disability in children, with a prevalence of roughly half a million children in the United States. Nearly all children with CP undergo physical therapy to improve gait, strength, balance, or flexibility. This therapy depends on dosage far in excess of available clinical session time, making adherence to an at-home therapy regimen critical to success. As therapy may be difficult, repetitive, or just not fun, maintaining engagement, adherence, and exercise relevance and quality in pediatric rehabilitation patients are critical barriers to an effective at-home rehabilitative physical therapy regimen.  To promote engagement and adherence, a solution must be attractive and fun, build rapport with the patient, and promote focus within a session as well as longitudinal motivation. Active video games have proven to be an improvement over typical practice but leave room for innovation; recent research suggests a promising complementary approach based on an artificially intelligent, physically embodied social agent. By activating humans’ natural social responses, socially assistive robots have been shown to enhance engagement and adherence in related settings.  Charles River Analytics and our partners at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital propose a Phase I SBIR to prototype and demonstrate the feasibility of “Rehabilitation Engagement at Home with a socially Assistive roBot for Pediatric Adherence” (REHAB-PAL). REHAB-PAL is a socially assistive robot for children undergoing rehabilitative physical therapy that provides companionship and engagement during therapy. REHAB-PAL improves adherence to the home-care regimen by encouraging the prescribed therapeutic exercises with fun and supportive interaction. To rigorously isolate its effects, we will compare the robot to a behaviorally analogous screen-based virtual agent.  We will prototype and demonstrate REHAB-PAL’s feasibility via three Specific Aims: (1) Design and develop socially assistive application software for a commercially available small humanoid robot and a screen-based virtual agent. (2) Integrate with a visuo-motor integration task. (3) Evaluate clinical suitability of REHAB-PAL for gait and balance training in children with CP.  Ultimately, we aim to show that REHAB-PAL offers patients an engaging and encouraging companion throughout a potentially dreary treatment, while offering clinicians a superior tool to keep pediatric patients motivated and focused on their treatment and a valuable proxy to provide continuity, consistency and monitoring during home care. By enhancing the efficacy of therapeutic dosage outside the clinic, REHAB-PAL has the potential to extend and improve care, with less frequent clinic visits and improved adherence.

"Improving precision in modeling childhood executive function trajectories using psychometrics Project Summary: Executive functions are high-level supervisory cognitive skills vital for a child’s social and academic success. Their core components include working memory, inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility. The development of executive functions in children can be adversely affected by many early life risk factors, such as lead exposure and low socioeconomic status. However, there are two difficulties to precisely measuring and modeling executive functions, which hamper our understanding of how risk factors can predict shifts in executive functioning: 1) It is common to use a single child performance task to tap into an executive function component. While this can yield important information, it can also lead to bias, because executive functions can be difficult to measure precisely, since they are interdependent and also rely on non-executive function skills. 2) It can be challenging to model the longitudinal development of executive functions because the set of tasks used to assess executive functions can change as a child grows. Some tasks may be specific to a particular age range and not appropriate for other ages. To address the first difficulty, we will improve the precision of measuring an executive function component by using well-established latent variable approaches which integrate output from multiple tasks. Preliminary analyses demonstrate that this approach can yield improved interpretability of a risk factor’s impact on an executive function component, compared to separate analyses of each task. To address the second difficulty, we propose to use advanced psychometric and item response theory methods to create a longitudinal scale of executive functioning with optimized precision and construct validity that span all the ages of interest. This will allow us to identify how risk factors can predict changes in executive function over time (e.g. developmental trajectory). This proposal leverages data from two large, NIH-funded prospective birth cohorts with extensive longitudinal data and repeated assessments of many executive function tasks, and detailed measures of risk factors (e.g. lead exposure, low socioeconomic status). Open-source, user-friendly software for the developed approaches will be developed, including a web application for non-statistical users. I (Dr. Shelley Liu) am a biostatistician and an Assistant Professor in Population Health Science and Policy at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS). ISMMS provides an excellent environment for this K25; all mentors and advisory committee members are based at ISMMS. My training will involve 1) formal graduate level coursework on executive function development, child neuropsychology, item response theory and psychometric scaling; 2) tutorials in neurodevelopment and psychometrics with my mentoring team; and 3) clinical rotations to observe neurobehavioral assessments. This training will complement my existing expertise in biostatistics. I aim to become an independent, R01-funded researcher studying child neurodevelopment and associated risk factors.

"Application of Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Data to a Predictive Model of Neuroblastoma Project Summary There is currently no diagnostic tool to accurately predict pediatric neuroblastoma disease outcome that is based on the mechanistic nature of the disease and genomic information of a child’s tumor. Neuroblastoma is a solid, cancerous tumor of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) that accounts for half of all cancers in infants younger than 1 year. Uncertainties in the trajectory of disease progression has led to aggressive radiation and chemotherapy treatments that often result in long-term developmental disabilities for children. Determination of the critical drivers of neuroblastoma initiation and assessment of their interactions for an individual child would help target chemotherapy and limit over-treatment, possibly resulting in an increased quality of life and infant survival. Our solution to this problem is to develop a predictive artificial intelligence algorithm (PredictNeuroB) and use genomic input from a child’s tumor to test its predictive strengths to predict disease progression, identify critical disease drivers and compare results to current clinical statistical-based algorithms. PredictNeuroB is based on the network interactions of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) developmental signals and is supported by our discovery of a critical role for trkB and its ligand brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) during SNS development. Our published model’s prediction of early stage neuroblastoma (for infants 0-2yrs old) using genomic information of 77 children is more accurate than any current clinical prognostic (Kasemeier-Kulesa et al., 2018). In this study, we propose to strengthen the predictive capability of our model for a broader class of patient data (age, stage of disease, chromosome status, MYCN amplification) by applying Gabriella Miller Kids First neuroblastoma databases. Further, we will perform in silico perturbations of the algorithm to determine critical drivers capable of altering neuroblastoma outcome states. At the conclusion of our study, by using a larger set of patient-derived data with associated clinical and disease outcome information, we expect our PredictNeuroB model will prove highly predictive for a broad class of neuroblastoma patients and support clinical decision making in disease treatment and targeted drug therapies. Project Narrative Neuroblastoma accounts for half of all childhood cancers in infants younger than 1 year, yet there is no diagnostic tool to accurately predict disease progression and outcome. Our solution to this problem is to develop a predictive artificial intelligence algorithm (PredictNeuroB) that is based on the developmental signaling network from which neuroblastoma originates and test its capability to more precisely predict disease outcome using a child’s genomic information as input. By leveraging the information in Gabriella Miller Kids First databases we will test PredictNeuroB for a broader class of children than available in published academic data, resulting in a precise and personalized prognostic tool with the possibility to increase infant quality of life and survival by limiting over-treatment and targeting chemotherapy.",Application of Gabriella Miller Kids First

"Multi-Site Validation Study of the HLHS Arrest Predictor Each year in the US, there are thousands of children who are born with a severe congenital deformation, where one of the two ventricles in the heart is severely underdeveloped. If they survive infancy, these children can go on to live full and normal lives. The mortality rate for this condition is 15%, and 63% of these deaths are due to cardio-respiratory arrests. This alarming rate of arrest events persists despite vigilant ICU care with the best available intensive monitoring equipment. Our overall goal is to improve current patient monitoring systems by developing machine learning algorithms that can predict the onset of an arrest event, hours before it occurs. This early warning indication can be provided to nurses and doctors who can intervene to prevent these life-threatening events from occurring, improving outcomes for these critically ill children. Preliminary studies at Texas Children's Hospital have resulted in a computer algorithm that can estimate the odds of arrest in single ventricle children, 1-2 hours prior to overt symptoms. The algorithm is based on a logistic regression risk model, and was developed using over 55,000 hours of vital sign observations. The specific aims of the proposed research are: (1) To test the hypothesis that this computer algorithm can provide an early warning of arrest, with sufficient accuracy for clinical use across different clinical centers; (2) To understand the relationship between the risk score provided by this algorithm and other post- surgical complications that commonly occur in these children during the their hospitalization. Aim 1 is a multi-center study of this algorithm on a large, prospective, and independent cohort, in order to measure its true predictive performance. Performance metrics to be measured will be the ROC area and positive and negative likelihood ratios. This will help us determine the optimal threshold for the detection of an arrest event. Aims 2 focus on relating the risk of arrest to outcomes such as mechanical circulatory support, re-operation, arrhythmia, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Successful completion of these aims will result in the first clinically validated, real- time early warning system for anticipating acute arrest events in children with single ventricle physiology. The techniques and technologies developed in this work are immediately translatable to other diseases and conditions for both adults and children. Thousands of children each year are born in the US with only a single functional ventricle, putting them at substantial risk of acute cardiac arrest and ultimately death. This project will validate a new monitoring technology, developed at Texas Children's Hospital, which can predict the onset of arrest 1-2 hours before it occurs in this population. This technology will provide nurses and doctors the valuable time that they need to mitigate problems leading up to arrest before these problems become life threatening, improving the chance of survival for these critically ill children.",Multi-Site Validation Study of the HLHS Arrest Predictor,10171413,R01HL142994,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Arrhythmia ', ' Cardiac Arrhythmia ', ' Heart Arrhythmias ', ' Behavior ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Colorado ', ' Computers ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Equipment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Heart ', ' Heart Arrest ', ' Asystole ', ' Cardiac Arrest ', ' Cardiac Surgery procedures ', ' Cardiac Surgery ', ' Cardiac Surgical Procedures ', ' Heart Surgical Procedures ', ' heart surgery ', ' Heart Ventricle ', ' Cardiac Ventricles ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Pediatric Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' indexing ', ' Infant ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Physiology ', ' Postoperative Complications ', ' post-operative complications ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caring ', ' Common Ventricle ', ' Absence of interventricular septum ', ' Cor triloculare biatriatum ', ' single functional ventricle ', ' single ventricle ', ' univentricular heart ', ' Critically ill children ', ' critically ill child ', ' base ', ' Patient Monitoring System ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' repaired ', ' repair ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Surgical complication ', ' surgery complication ', ' Lesion ', ' infancy ', ' infantile ', ' Blood flow ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Palliative Surgery ', ' news ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' Life ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Hour ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Necrotizing Enterocolitis ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' respiratory ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' validation studies ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Cardiac ', ' adjudicate ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' clinical practice ', ' operation ', ' Pediatric cardiology ', ' improved outcome ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' clinical center ', ' ']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,575613,TX-09
"Clinical Epidemiology of Pediatric COVID-19 and MIS-C PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Although the novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has accounted for significant health and economic costs throughout the world, relatively little is known about its effect on children. The first pediatric case of SARS- CoV-2 in the United States was reported on March 2, 2020, and within just three months, over 64,000 cases were confirmed. Even though children, as a group, have been relatively spared from the effects of the virus, there has been an increasing body of evidence to suggest that some may become critically ill. Since a number of children with SARS-CoV-2 infections manifest with severe systemic inflammation and multi-organ dysfunction, more research on determinants of disease and long-term outcomes of those affected is critical. Dr. Oliveira is a pediatric infectious disease clinician whose long-term goal is to become an independently funded physician-scientist, who integrates the disciplines of clinical epidemiology, data science, and biomedical informatics to detect and respond to emerging infectious diseases. The work described in this proposal builds on the scientific themes he developed throughout his prior training and aims to mechanistically understand the effects of SARS-CoV-2 in children by integrating three different scientific tools: natural language processing, machine learning, and clinical epidemiology. The first consideration for this K23 award period will be to use novel computational tools to build automated surveillance and data-extraction system that can facilitate the identification and tracking of incident cases of SARS-CoV-2 in children (Aim 1). Using this surveillance system, Dr. Oliveira will create a comprehensive registry and conduct a rigorous, model-based investigation to derive a state-of-the-art prediction model of clinical deterioration in children with SARS-CoV-2 (Aim 2). Last, he will recruit a longitudinal cohort of SARS-Cov-2 and determine the frequency of complications and long-term outcomes after recovery (Aim 3). This mentored research experience will furnish Dr. Oliveira with skills and expertise in various aspects of clinical epidemiology, including the establishment of surveillance systems, conducting longitudinal studies, computer programing, and executing sophisticated analyses of the longitudinal data. Workshops, semester- long courses will complement this practical experience, and one-on-one mentorship by a multidisciplinary team of established, independently funded, internationally respected investigators and pioneers in the fields of epidemiology, infectious diseases, biomedical informatics, and mathematical modeling. After this work, Dr. Oliveira will have produced important science that could improve the care of all the children affected by this pandemic. Furthermore, he will have gained a unique set of skills and built the necessary infrastructure that will allow him to establish a research program integrating the disciplines of clinical epidemiology, data science, and informatics to detect, prevent, and respond to future pandemics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Fear of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is widespread, and the emotional toll of this virus on our society is enormous. However, relatively little is known about the effects of this virus on children. Empiric estimates on the risks and long-term effects of this virus in children will enable clinicians and policymakers to make informed decisions about both the need for optimal use of preventative and therapeutic interventions as they become available.",Clinical Epidemiology of Pediatric COVID-19 and MIS-C,10191775,K23AI159518,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', '

"The Pediatric Advanced Cancer Experience (PACE): Measuring Quality of End-of-Life Care for Children with Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY Although cure rates for childhood cancer have increased over several decades, cancer remains the leading cause of non-accidental death in children. Yet, there are no existing quality measures to define optimal end-of- life care (EOLC) for children with cancer. A lack of standards for EOLC contributes to high healthcare utilization for children with advanced, incurable cancer, as well as widely variable palliative care provision. For adults with cancer, high quality EOLC is defined at least in part by measures to reduce use of intensive healthcare resources, such as avoidance of hospital stays in the last weeks of life and prompt referral to hospice. In contrast, attributes of high quality EOLC for children with cancer have not been previously elucidated. To address this gap in knowledge, the overall objectives of this proposal are to prioritize family-centered quality measures for EOLC and to pioneer complementary approaches to assess care quality for children with advanced cancer. Specific aims are to: (1) establish a priority list of EOLC quality measures, from the perspective of parents of children with cancer; (2) characterize EOLC process measures for children who died of cancer, using natural language processing in electronic health records; and (3) develop and pilot the “Pediatric Advanced Cancer Experience” (PACE) questionnaire to prospectively appraise care quality for children with advanced cancer. Completion of these aims will lay the foundation for the first multi-center, multi- modal evaluation of end-of-life care quality in children with cancer. The long term goal of Dr. Ananth’s research program is to build a platform for systematically measuring, reporting, and incentivizing high quality EOLC in children with cancer, facilitating goal-concordant care delivery. Through the proposed research, Dr. Ananth seeks to advance the science of measuring EOLC quality in childhood cancer. Dr. Ananth is supported by an outstanding mentorship team and scientific advisory committee, with substantial expertise spanning patient- reported outcomes, artificial intelligence-based techniques for research, and pediatric palliative care investigation. Dr. Ananth will pursue formal training in patient-centered quality measurement, natural language processing, and questionnaire design and validation, concurrently building skills in leadership of a multi-center consortium. Collectively, the research in this proposal and career development plan will amply prepare her for an independent career focused on enhancing quality of care for children with advanced, incurable cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although most children with cancer are cured long-term, 10-15% of children will ultimately develop advanced, incurable illness, rendering cancer the leading cause of non-accidental death in children. Currently, no measures exist to assess the quality of care children with cancer receive near the end of life. The proposed research will help develop family-centered measures of high quality end-of-life care and test novel methods of evaluating quality.",The Pediatric Advanced Cancer Experience (PACE): Measuring Quality of End-of-Life Care for Children with Cancer,10190336,K08CA259222,"['Academy ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Award ', ' Bereavement ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Child Care ', ' Puericulture ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communication ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' hospice environment ', ' Hospices ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Incentives ', ' Intubation ', ' Leadership ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Libraries ', ' Manuals ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Palliative Care ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' comfort care ', ' Parents ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Measures ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Questionnaire Designs ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Technics ', ' Research Techniques ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Science ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Process Measure ', ' Caring ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' Measurement ', ' Development Plans ', ' Malignant Childhood Neoplasm ', ' Childhood Cancers ', ' Malignant Childhood Tumor ', ' Malignant Pediatric Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Pediatric Tumor ', ' Malignant childhood cancer ', ' cancer in a child ', ' cancer in children ', ' child with cancer ', ' childhood malignancy ', ' children with cancer ', ' pediatric cancer ', ' pediatric malignancy ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' end of life care ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' Property ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' cancer care ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' end-of-life ', ' end of life ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Non-accidental ', ' Nonaccidental ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' evidence base ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' ']",NCI,YALE UNIVERSITY,K08,2021,220150,CT-03
"Feeling and Body Investigators (FBI)-ARFID Division: Sensory and Somatic Exposure for Children with Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) is a newly articulated eating disorder in the DSM-5 in which individuals are not able to consume an adequate quantity or variety of food to sustain healthy growth and de- velopment. ARFID typically onsets in early childhood, yet identification of the disorder is poor. The end result is that children often have sustained inadequate nutrition with resulting severe physical consequences and threats to optimal social and emotional development. Early intervention is essential. However, there are no em- pirically validated treatments for young children with ARFID. Children with ARFID are known to be sensitive individuals: with a low threshold for noticing internal body sensations (e.g., gastrointestinal distress) and exter- nal sensory sensations (e.g., smells) and experiencing these sensations as uncomfortable/aversive. This sen- sitivity, and the associated negative emotional reactions (e.g., of disgust, fear, sadness), may encourage avoidance of activities that cause these sensory experiences, such as eating. An intervention that could change reactions to sensory and somatic sensations to one of playful curiosity may increase approach behav- ior and food consumption. We designed an acceptance-based interoceptive exposure treatment for children to achieve this goal. We teach children and caregivers to be “FBI Agents,” individuals who view somatic and sen- sory sensations as clues to a mystery via the use of engaging illustrative cartoon characters (e.g., Gassy Gus), body investigations that provoke intense sensations and worksheets that map sensations to meanings and ac- tions. The goal is to make somatic and sensory experiences playful – and to promote adaptive self-awareness and food approach. The overall objective of this study is to determine whether treatment results in reduced negative emotions to somatic and sensory sensations, including those associated with food and eating, and whether this, in turn, increases food approach. This will be accomplished by a randomized controlled trial (N = 140, 70 per cell) comparing The Feeling and Body Investigators (FBI) - ARFID Division treatment, a 20-session outpatient treatment, to a control group in children (5 to 9 years of age) with ARFID. The control treatment (FAD: Family-Assisted Diet) will provide family-supported exposure. Our proposed mediator of treatment re- sponse is negative affect: a child’s facial affect in response to food presentation as measured via smartphone videos. Outcomes include changes in anthropometric measurements, nutrition variety and adequacy, and psy- chosocial functioning. Medical and psychological measurements will be assessed pre- and post-treatment, at every session, and 3-month follow-up. Deliverables include an empirically validated treatment(s); medical guidelines for the early detection of insufficient nutrition; practical tools for assessing food acceptance in the home via smartphones; and guidance about the number of food presentations necessary to facilitate acceptance. Ultimately, we will evaluate this treatment and disseminate materials via primary care to provide tools to intervene early on food avoidance. Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) is a disorder in which individuals are not able to consume an adequate amount or variety of food to a degree that it affects their growth. The goal of this project is to compare 2 treatments and see which one (or both) is effective in treating ARFID in children. As a result of this project, we will have tested treatments for children with ARFID; developed medical guidelines for the early detection of insufficient nutrition; developed practical tools for assessing food acceptance in the home via smartphones; and have acquired practical guidance about the number of times parents need to present food to get their child to like it.",Feeling and Body Investigators (FBI)-ARFID Division: Sensory and Somatic Exposure for Children with Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder,10286200,R33MH121549,"['Affect ', ' Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Attention ', ' Cartoons ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Computers ', ' Control Groups ', ' Curiosities ', ' Decision Trees ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Diet Fads ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating Disorders ', ' Emotions ', ' Engineering ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Family ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Growth and Development function ', ' Growth and Development ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Maps ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Motivation ', ' nutrition ', ' Parents ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Esthesia ', ' Sensation ', ' Smell Perception ', ' Olfaction ', ' Smell ', ' odor perception ', ' olfactory perception ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vomiting ', ' Emesis ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Mediating ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' emotional reaction ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Self Perception ', ' Personal awareness ', ' Self image ', ' Self view ', ' self awareness ', ' self knowledge ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' depressed ', ' sadness ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Diagnostic ', ' re-treatment ', ' Retreatment ', ' Investigation ', ' Reaction ', ' Sensory ', ' Texture ', ' Pattern ', ' gastrointestinal ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' Approach-avoidance conflict ', ' approach avoidance behavior ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Emotional ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' DSM-5 ', ' DSM5 ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-V ', ' DSM-V ', ' BMI ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' food consumption ', ' feeding ', ' approach behavior ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' improved functioning ', ' Outcome ', ' Consumption ', ' 9 year old ', ' 9 years of age ', ' age 9 years ', ' nine year old ', ' nine years of age ', ' Impairment ', ' effective intervention ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' arm ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' family support ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' reduce symptoms ', ' alleviate symptom ', ' ameliorating symptom ', ' decrease symptom ', ' fewer symptoms ', ' relieves symptoms ', ' symptom alleviation ', ' symptom reduction ', ' symptom relief ', ' clinical diagnostics ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' food avoidance ', ' avoidant restrictive food intake disorder ', ' dietary ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R33,2021,753701,NC-04
"Resting state connectivity signatures of obsessive compulsive symptoms PROJECT SUMMARY Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disabling illness that exhibits bimodal timing of onset, with up to half of cases beginning in childhood. Subclinical obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) often precede the development of clinically significant OCD, though symptoms in some children remit naturally over time. However, the neural bases of OCS and their changes over development are poorly understood. Capitalizing on large, publicly available datasets and sophisticated computational methods, I propose to examine functional MRI signatures of OCS and their longitudinal trajectories in children and adolescents. Specifically, I will apply machine learning to publicly available data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, a prospective community sample tracked longitudinally at 21 diverse sites across the United States, to reveal whole-brain functional MRI patterns that correspond to OCS severity. Baseline data is already available from approximately 12,000 children aged 9-10 whose families have committed to ongoing follow-up. I will then use data from the independent Healthy Brain Network (HBN) study, which includes data from approximately 2,500 children from the New York City area, to statistically and clinically validate these patterns (Aim 1). I will then combine baseline neuroimaging and clinical data with longitudinal follow-up clinical data from the ABCD study to examine neural signatures that predict subsequent OCS trajectories (Aim 2). Finally, I will leverage data collected from children with clinical-severity OCS (i.e., OCD) before and after gold-standard cognitive behavioral therapy at the New York State Psychiatric Institute (NYSPI) to identify pre-treatment predictors of response and remission (Exploratory Aim). Collectively, these aims will identify brain connectivity features that correspond to reliable patterns in which OCS co-vary, which could hint at common mechanisms underlying multiple symptoms and implicate specific circuits that can be targeted in future studies aimed at developing and testing novel treatments and prevention strategies. Furthermore, this research proposal integrates a detailed training plan that will bring me closer to my goal of becoming a physician-scientist focused on clinical and computational psychiatry. Supported by the resources of both Columbia University Irving Medical Center and the NYSPI, I will deepen my technical skills in MRI image processing, neuroimaging analysis, and machine learning, while also improving my scientific writing, oral presentation, and clinical skills.

"Effect of complex mixtures on oxidative stress and cognition in children ABSTRACT In many areas of the world, children are regularly exposed to environmental chemicals. During any given period of life, children will experience exposure to many chemicals at the same time. The effects of such mixtures of chemicals on the molecular underpinnings of the disease process, such as oxidative stress (OS) or on functional endpoints such as cognitive functions, are not well understood in children. There is also little understating of the extent to which endogenous antioxidant defenses in children's bodies or exogenous antioxidants buffer the effects of chemical mixtures on children's health. The few studies on this topic to date have been mostly cross-sectional or limited to small numbers of chemicals. To address these gaps, the proposed study will leverage the Salud Ambiental Montevideo (SAM) cohort in Uruguay, which has enrolled 679 1st-grade children between years 2012-19. Currently, children range in age 7-15 years and have been followed-up for 0-5 years, depending on year of enrollment. Exposure to chlorpyrifos and pyrethroids pesticides has been characterized in a sub-sample of children using urinary metabolites of the pesticides. Exposure to metals in this cohort is generally low. In a cross-sectional pilot study of SAM participants, a metal mixture was linked to higher levels of oxidative DNA damage and with lower performance on a test of general cognitive abilities. The proposed study will consist of 3 years of follow-up of SAM children to annually characterize the levels of metals in blood and urine, and metabolites of chlorpyrifos, pyrethroids, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in urine. Each year, urinary biomarkers of OS (F2-isoprostane and 8-OHdG), serum antioxidant enzymes (GPx and PON1), and serum antioxidant vitamins (vitamin C, carotenoids, retinol, etc). will be measured. A sub-sample of ~100 children will participate in a year-long intensive (monthly) assessment of OS biomarkers to characterize short-term fluctuations in biomarkers and their biological predictors. Children will complete assessments of executive functions (EF) in Y2 and Y3 of the study. Leveraging data collected at enrollment into SAM (T0, ~7y), chemical mixtures will be constructed in statistical machine learning models for four time points: T0 and Y1-3 of the proposed study. These mixtures will be modeled to understand how exposure to mixtures over time is associated with OS and EF. Potential effect modification by antioxidants will be tested. The proposed activities align with the 2018-23 NIEHS strategic plan of research on the exposome to promote human health through the advancement of environmental health sciences. Specifically, they will: 1) advance the basic understanding of short (1 yr) and medium-term (3 yrs) fluctuations in biomarkers of OS and antioxidant defenses, which have not been investigated in children; 2) contribute to understanding of the extent to which chemical mixtures in early-middle childhood affect a molecular process (OS) thought to underlie the development of chronic disease, as well as functional endpoints that underlie children's learning and social interactions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Throughout their lives, children are exposed to many different chemicals but our understanding of the effects of these mixtures on child health is limited. Our research is relevant to public health: it will inform prevention efforts and communication of risks by creating a deeper understanding of how exposure to chemical mixtures affects oxidative stress and cognition in children and how well the body's antioxidant defenses are able to counteract these effects. Our work is also relevant to the mission of the NIEHS: it will contribute fundamental knowledge on environmental influences on disease.",Effect of complex mixtures on oxidative stress and cognition in children,10265540,R01ES031411,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Antioxidants ', ' anti-oxidant ', ' Ascorbic Acid ', ' VIT C ', ' Vitamin C ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Buffers ', ' Carotenoids ', ' Carotenes and Carotenoids ', ' carotenoid biosynthesis ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Cognition ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Chlorpyrifos ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' glutathione peroxidase ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Memory ', ' Metals ', ' Mission ', ' Pesticides ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons ', ' polyaromatic hydrocarbons ', ' polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Uruguay ', ' Vitamins ', ' Work ', ' Arylesterase ', ' PON1 ', ' Paraoxonase 1 ', ' Measures ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Tocopherols ', ' All-Trans-Retinol ', ' Anti-Infective vitamin ', ' Antixerophthalmic vitamin ', ' Axerophthol ', ' Axerophtholum ', ' Biosterol ', ' Lard-Factor ', ' Oleovitamin A ', ' Ophthalamin ', ' Vitamin A Alcohol ', ' retinol ', ' aryldialkylphosphatase ', ' Aryl-dialkyl Phosphatase ', ' Arylalkylphosphatase ', ' Aryltriphosphatase ', ' Aryltriphosphate dialkylphosphohydrolase ', ' Esterase B1 ', ' Esterase E4 ', ' Homocysteine Thiolactone Hydrolase ', ' OPA Anhydrase ', ' OPH Enzyme ', ' Organophosphorus Acid Anhydrase ', ' Organophosphorus Acid Anhydrolase ', ' Organophosphorus Acid Hydrolase ', ' Organophosphorus Hydrolase ', ' Paraoxon esterase ', ' Paraoxonase ', ' Pirimiphos-methyloxon esterase ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Funding ', ' enzyme activity ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' Complex ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' 1st grade ', ' first grade ', ' experience ', ' 6-11 years old ', ' middle childhood ', ' Performance ', ' pyrethroid ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' F2-Isoprostanes ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' BMI ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Modification ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' urinary ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' NIEHS ', ' oxidative DNA damage ', ' improved functioning ', ' Outcome ', ' aged ', ' Metal exposure ', ' exposure to metal ', ' environmental chemical ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' early adolescence ', ' cognitive performance ', ' antioxidant enzyme ', ' anti-oxidant enzyme ', ' cognitive ability ', ' Child Health ', ' individual variation ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variability ', ' Infrastructure ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' ']",NIEHS,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2021,543551,NY-26
"A Mobile Game for Domain Adaptation and Deep Learning in Autism Healthcare Project Summary Neuropsychiatric disorders are the single greatest cause of disability due to non-communicable disease worldwide, accounting for 14% of the global burden of disease. The current standards of care suffer from subjectivity, inconsistent delivery, and limited access with growing waitlists. New informatics solutions, in particular artificial intelligence (AI) that can port to more ubiquitous mobile health devices and that are not restricted for use in clinical settings, have great potential to complement or even replace aspects of the standards of care. We propose to develop a novel informatics solution for one of the most pressing mental health burdens, autism, which is up in incidence by more than 600% since 1990, among the fastest growing pediatric concerns today, and highly representative of many other neuropsychiatric conditions. We have invented a prototype mobile system called Guess What (guesswhat.stanford.edu) (GW) that turns the focus of the camera on the child through a fluid social engagement with his/her social partner that reinforces prosocial learning while simultaneously measuring the child’s developmental learning progress. At its simplest level, the GW app challenges the child to imitate social and emotion-centric prompts shown on the screen of a smartphone held just above the eyes of the individual with whom the child is playing. But more, as a home-based repeat-use system, GW uses computer vision algorithms and emotion classifiers integrated into gameplay to detect emotion in the child’s face via the phone’s front camera, automatically finding agreement with the displayed prompt, while capturing features such as gaze, eye contact, and joint attention. Preliminary work with more than 20 autistic children resulted in positive user feedback, evidence of high engagement for both the parents and children, and importantly, evidence of clinically meaningful gains in socialization. A single session produces 90 seconds of enriched social video and sensor data, opening up an exciting opportunity for the game play itself to passively generate labeled computer vision libraries that enable the development of better models with higher diagnostic precision going forward. Our proposed project will show that GW can (a.) serve as a mobile therapy that can be used repeatedly by families to target core deficits of autism while inherently tracking progress during use, and, (b.) serve as a distributed system to crowdsource the acquisition of new labeled image libraries for AI models that can automatically classify diagnostic features relevant to autism and extend to other sectors of mental health (and even beyond). Project Narrative Mental health, which accounts for a significant percentage of the global health burden, can be effectively managed through mobile and digital tools, yet suffers from limited access, inconsistent treatments, and qualitative approaches that do not scale. Taking aim at an increasingly pervasive and canonical mental health problem, autism, we plan to build a game-based solution that can treat (addressing issues social interaction, eye contact, and social-emotional awareness, among other things) while tracking progress, and that can automatically generate computer vision libraries for deep learning models that permit enhanced diagnostic feature extraction in the future.",A Mobile Game for Domain Adaptation and Deep Learning in Autism Healthcare,10122795,R01LM013364,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anger ', ' angers ', ' angry ', ' Animals ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Distributed Systems ', ' Emotions ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Forehead ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Gestures ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Manuals ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' Parents ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Socialization ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' autistic children ', ' children with ASD ', ' children with autism ', ' children with autism spectrum disorder ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' sensor ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Life ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' gaze ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Informatics ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' Devices ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' global health ', ' Symptoms ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' joint attention ', ' social reciprocity ', ' Outcome ', ' social communication ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' 8 year old ', ' 8 years of age ', ' age 8 years ', ' eight year old ', ' eight years of age ', ' treatment effect ', ' image archival system ', ' Image data archive ', ' image archive ', ' image library ', ' image repository ', ' imaging repository ', ' picture archive ', ' prototype ', ' computer generated ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' personalized diagnostics ', ' personalized diagnosis ', ' precise diagnostics ', ' precision diagnostics ', ' personalized care ', ' Precision care ', ' individualized care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' crowdsourcing ', ' crowd source ', ' crowd-sourcing ', ' crowdsource ', ' Data Science ', ' personalized health care ', ' personalized healthcare ', ' precision health care ', ' precision healthcare ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' data archive ', ' data library ', ' Android ', ' social engagement ', ' social involvement ', ' social participation ', ' applied behavior analysis ', ' applied behavioral analysis ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' feature extraction ', ' feasibility testing ', ' Home ', ' ']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,667434,CA-18
"Timing of prenatal stress and early markers of child psychopathology PROJECT SUMMARY Psychopathology is a very serious public health burden that not only affects adults, but also many children and adolescents. To better understand this devastating problem, the scientific community has focused its efforts on pinpointing the earliest developmental origins of psychopathology. A considerable literature now implicates prenatal stress as a critical determinant of poor psychological functioning in childhood and beyond. However, knowledge about whether the timing of prenatal stress differentially influences the development of child psychopathology is virtually unknown. Gaining such knowledge is the long-term goal of our research. This proposed project “piggybacks” on our current RO1-funded project (NICHD grant # R01HD085990) that is following a cohort of 335 women oversampled for life stress, with data collection starting at pregnancy week 15 until 6 months postpartum. We are conducting a granular assessment of pregnancy stress (measured weekly by maternal report) with the goal of understanding critical periods during fetal life when stress derails later infant behavioral and physiological stress responsivity. The overall objective of this new RO1 project is to follow this cohort into the child's preschool years. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will determine how the differential timing of prenatal stress influences behavior problems and psychopathology measured at age 4, how differences in self-regulation (an important precursor of mental health functioning) mediates the relationship between prenatal stress and psychopathology at age 4, and how these relationships differ between boys and girls. Aim 2 will test a host of postnatal risk factors (e.g., poor maternal mental health, poverty, intimate partner violence) and resilience factors (e.g., sensitive parenting, coping skills) as moderators of the effects of timing of prenatal stress on behavior problems and psychopathology at age 4. Importantly and uniquely, postnatal stress (mother and child) is assessed also in a fine-grained manner by every 3 month assessments from age 6 mos to 4 years. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use an exploratory statistical approach, machine learning, to detect which relatively small epochs of stress in postnatal life (measured every 3 months) interact with small epochs of prenatal stress to maximally influence child behavior problems and psychopathology. This project is innovative in its highly multimethod approach (e.g., behavioral observation, salivary analytes, laboratory tasks), its granular assessment of chronic and episodic prenatal and postnatal stressors, and the novel statistical approaches used to determine which epochs of stress are most relevant for psychopathology. This highly significant research will be the first longitudinal, prospective, multi-method study of how differential timing of prenatal stress influences the development of psychopathology, as mediated by child self-regulation and moderated by postnatal environmental factors. Thus, this study is critical for understanding how early child development sets the stage for psychopathology and will lead to increased understanding of the developmental epochs to be targeted for preventative interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Prenatal stress has devastating effects on children's neurobehavioral development, including elevating the risk for mental health disorders. What remains virtually unknown, however, is how the differential timing of prenatal stress affects the risk for later psychopathology, how this risk is mediated by children's capacity to self-regulate, and the role of the postnatal family environment in exacerbating or reducing this risk. The proposed study will provide essential information about how the timing of prenatal stress, child regulatory capacity, and the postnatal environment interact to increase risk for emerging psychopathology, which will inform strategies for developing and implementing interventions to prevent poor mental health and other negative child outcomes.",Timing of prenatal stress and early markers of child psychopathology,10224293,R01HD100469,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Sinus Arrhythmia ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Child Behavior ', ' Child Development ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Parenting ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' childrearing ', ' Preschool Child ', ' 1-5 years old ', ' preschool child (1-5) ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Infant ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Mothers ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Poverty ', ' Impoverished ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Stress ', ' Teratogens ', ' Teratogenic ', ' Teratogenicity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Coping Skills ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' Postpartum ', ' post-partum ', ' base ', ' Chronic ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Funding ', ' Problem behavior ', ' behavioral problem ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Salivary ', ' postnatal ', ' System ', ' fetal stress ', ' prenatal stress ', ' respiratory ', ' fetal ', ' behavioral observation ', ' behavior observation ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' stressor ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' novel ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' stressed mothers ', ' maternal stress ', ' Impulsivity ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' NICHD ', "" National Institute of Children's Health and Human Development "", ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' intervention for prevention ', ' prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' preventive intervention ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' biobehavior ', ' biobehavioral ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' virtual ', ' resilience ', ' externalizing behavior ', ' Outcome ', ' Life Stress ', ' prospective ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' 4 year old ', ' 4 years of age ', ' age 4 years ', ' four year old ', ' four years of age ', ' critical period ', ' stress reactivity ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' Grain ', ' ']",NICHD,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,617941,MI-08
"Creating an artificial intelligence therapy-to-data feedback loop for child developmental healthcare Project Summary There is a sharp and increasing imbalance between the number of children with autism in need of care and the availability of specialists certified to treat the disorder in its multi-faceted manifestations. The autism community faces a dual clinical challenge: how to direct scarce specialist resources to service the diverse array of phenomes and how to monitor and validate best practices in treatment. Clinicians must now look to solutions that scale in a decentralized fashion, placing data capture, remote monitoring, and therapy increasingly into the hands of families. Using artificial intelligence (AI) and large amounts of labeled human emotion computer vision data, we have developed a solution for automatic facial expression recognition that runs on Google Glasses and Android smartphones to deliver real time social cues to individuals with autism in the child’s natural environment. We hypothesize that this informatic system can provide real-time therapy in a way that scales to meet the demand of the growing population of autism families, including underserved minorities, while growing data that can be used to measure progress over time and in the development of novel AI. Our first aim will focus on the development of a deep learning model that enables dynamic emotion recognition in the real world, and on domain adaptation procedures that enable minimal manual labeling to personalize the model for optimal accuracy on the individuals with whom the child will interact most regularly at home. Our second aim will focus on the human computer interface, namely the design of the user experience with the Android application that controls the sessions run on the Google Glass wearable. We will work our clinical colleagues and with groups of autism families to develop and enhance a set of games and activity modes that create social engagements ideal for emotion therapy, including an emotion capture and a charades game. The third aim will test our central hypothesis that the Glass system can create a therapy-to-data feedback loop that delivers clinical care while growing data for measurement and model development. We will work with up to 200 children ages 4-8 who have recent autism diagnoses and do not have access to standard behavioral therapy. We will build a community of autism families through crowdsourcing techniques, befitting the mobile paradigm embodied by our work, and through close collaboration with behavioral therapy providers, the autism outreach organization Autism Speaks, and the digital healthcare company, Cognoa. The families will work with us on design and refinement of our “Superpower Glass” system for fit, engagement, and function of use for both therapy and data capture. Importantly, we will send units home with families to use the device for at least 3 twenty-minute sessions per week for a minimum of 6 weeks. This remote period will generate a massive database to quantify overall social learning, emotion comprehension, eye contact, and sustained social acuity. In all, our work program will show that mobile wearable AI can bring the social learning process out of the clinic and into the real world for faster and more adaptive intervention. Project Narrative There is a sharp and growing imbalance between the number of clinical care providers available and the number of children with an autism diagnosis that leave most children without therapy until after critical periods in development have passed. We intend to address this problem through creation of a machine learning-enabled wearable that brings effective care to the home and empowers both parents, patients, and clinicians with mobile solutions that personalize care delivery to dramatically improve children’s outcomes. The Superpower Glass system, which delivers social cues to children during real-time interactions and provides several engagement modes for families, is a promising solution that enables greater access to care for families across the US, and potentially, across the globe.!",Creating an artificial intelligence therapy-to-data feedback loop for child developmental

"Inflammation Phenotypes in Pediatric Sepsis Induced Multiple Organ Failure Renewal Carcillo R01 Project Abstract Every year over 1 million American adults and children develop overwhelming infection leading to a rotting of their body we call ‘sepsis’, and death in up to 1 of 3 afflicted (www.nigms.nih.gov>NIGMS Home>Science Education). National efforts emphasizing early recognition, intravenous fluids to help organs, and antibiotics to kill infection, have reduced mortality so that now 1 of 4 die. We and others have asked the question “why do patients continue to die despite these national efforts?’ In the previous funding period we showed in 401 children with sepsis that those who developed organ shut down despite these efforts, did so because they were a) unable to fight germs causing unending infection, b) unable to stop clotting off their body causing kidney failure, and/or c) unable to kill viruses causing liver failure; all of which led to death from uncontrolled inflammation with clotting, bleeding and liver failure. Fortunately, each of these organ shutdown groups has hopeful treatments. With the new information we collected in the previous funding period we have already designed and started clinical trials testing these treatments including immune boosters for children unable to kill germs, plasma removal and replacement using plasma exchange for children unable to stop clotting, monoclonal antibodies to kill viruses and their homes to reverse liver failure in children unable to do so on their own, and anti-inflammatory proteins to reverse uncontrollable inflammation, in hopes of helping save many of the 1 of 4 children still dying from sepsis related organ shutdown. In this next funding period, we propose to use the clinical information and samples already obtained in our previous study to take advantage of the wonderful advances made this millenia in computer technology, big data, bioinformatics, and the study of human and virus genetics to perform Specific Aim 1) use a ‘Watson’ like approach to ask the computer to help us figure out if the children with sepsis have any other causes of organ shutdown that we can help, Specific Aim 2) use an ‘Ancestry.com’-like or ‘23 and me’-like approach to identify ‘precision medicine’ therapies for causes of organ shutdown that we can treat on a patient by patient basis, and Specific Aim 3) use a bedside molecular biology test approach to identify individualized therapies to kill DNA viruses and reduce cytokine inflammation. We think that DNA viruses are the unappreciated co-infection which causes uncontrolled cytokine inflammation and leads to organ shutdown. Our long term objective is to plan ‘precision’ medicine and ‘individualized’ medicine clinical trials testing therapies on an individual patient basis in order to further reduce death from sepsis organ shutdown in children. Carcillo R01 Narrative Statement Every year over 1 million American adults and children develop overwhelming infection leading to a rotting of their body we call ‘sepsis’, and death in up to 1 of 4 afflicted (www.nigms.nih.gov>NIGMS Home>Science Education). In our previous funding period we showed that this occurs when groups of patients are unable to kill germs, stop clotting or bleeding, or stop viruses from reproducing, and we have therefore designed and begun clinical trials to help these children do so. In this new funding period we are using ‘Watson’-like, ‘Twenty three and me’-like, and ‘Ancestry.com’-like approaches to figure out how to help each child with individually tailored treatments that are best at helping them live long and happy lives.",Inflammation Phenotypes in Pediatric Sepsis Induced Multiple Organ Failure Renewal,10207661,R01GM108618,"['Adenoviruses ', ' Adenoviridae ', '

"The New Tics Study: A Novel Approach to Pathophysiology and Cause of Tic Disorders Project Abstract At least 20% of all children have tics at some time in their life, making tic disorders a subject of substantial public health interest. However, only about 3% of all children have tics that last for a year or more. Thus chronic tic disorders, including Tourette syndrome, can be conceptualized as a two- step process: tics start, and then they fail to remit. By the numbers, the second part of this process is the more unusual and perhaps more closely related to disease, yet surprisingly, almost no research has examined this critical period after a first tic appears but before it is clear whether the child will go on to have a chronic tic disorder. Therefore prior research that has identified abnormalities of brain structure and function in children with TS generally does not clarify whether these abnormalities are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of tic disappearance. Furthermore, tic disappearance can be observed prospectively, allowing powerful within-subject analyses to test whether features of brain structure or function shortly after tic onset predict remission of tics before TS is diagnosable, and whether such features are state-related or more durable markers of vulnerability to tics. Colleagues in the TS field have agreed that such studies would be valuable, but have suspected that recruitment would be extremely difficult. However, we have now demonstrated enrollment of subjects with New Tics (defined as beginning within the previous 6 months, median 3.6 months) at a rate of 16 subjects per year when recruitment efforts were at their peak—though still on a shoestring budget without full staffing or media advertisements. We have implemented subject preparation and quality control methods that have allowed us to acquire structural and functional MRI data of high quality in many subjects. We now propose to enroll an additional 70 subjects with New Tics and characterize them carefully at baseline and at the 1-year anniversary of tic onset (when TS can first be diagnosed). Both time points will include clinical data, structural and functional MRI, and neuropsychological measures including ability to suppress tics. We expect that complete data will be available for 55-70 subjects (including those already collected), since MRI is sensitive to movement and we are selecting for subjects with tics and additional difficulty holding still (about half of children with tics also have ADHD). We will compare baseline data from this sample to matched tic-free control subjects, and to matched subjects who already have TS or a chronic tic disorder (leveraging existing data in our laboratories to provide some of the clinical and MRI data for these groups). Analyses will include tests of specific a priori hypotheses as well as machine learning analyses of the complete dataset. These comparisons will allow us to discover whether imaging differences in children with TS are present long before TS can be diagnosed, whether they fade when tics improve, and whether they predict outcome in children with new tics. Investigation of this “pre-Tourette” population opens an entirely new window for etiologic discovery in tic disorders. It may also have important clinical consequences, if the results identify which newly- ticcing children are at highest risk for development of a chronic tic disorder. Public Health Relevance Statement At least 20% of all children have tics at some time in their life, making tic disorders a subject of substantial public health interest. In many children the tics will disappear before they've lasted as long as a year, but in others they go on to become Tourette syndrome or Chronic Tic Disorder (TS/CTD). Prior research generally has not clarified whether abnormalities of brain structure and function in children with TS/CTD are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of tic disappearance. This project will study children with recent-onset tics using clinical evaluation, MRI, and neuropsychological measures, and repeat these measures at the earliest time point that TS/CTD can be diagnosed. The results from the first assessment will be compared to results from two matching comparison groups: children with no personal or family history of tics, and children who have had tics for more than a year (Existing TS/CTD). This new approach may provide a new angle on research into Tourette syndrome, in addition to providing sorely needed information about prognosis for children who just started ticcing.",The New Tics Study: A Novel Approach to Pathophysiology and Cause of Tic Disorders,10198671,R01MH104030,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Anniversary ', ' Attention ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Budgets ', ' caudate nucleus ', ' Nucleus Caudatus ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Laboratories ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Physiology ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality Control ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Rest ', ' Retrospective Studies ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Tic disorder ', ' Time ', ' Gilles de la Tourette syndrome ', "" Gilles de la Tourette's Disease "", "" Guinon's disease "", ' Tic Disorder, Combined Vocal and Multiple Motor ', ' Tourette Syndrome ', "" Tourette's "", "" Tourette's Disease "", "" Tourette's Disorder "", "" Tourette's Syndrome "", ' maladie des tics ', ' tic de Guinon ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' improved ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Family history of ', ' Family Medical History ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Psychiatric Diagnosis ', ' Life ', ' inattentiveness ', ' inattention ', ' Investigation ', ' Severities ', ' interest ', ' Remission ', ' Disease remission ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Appearance ', ' Sampling ', ' Advertisements ', ' AD/HD ', ' ADHD ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Clinical Data ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' vector ', ' comparison group ', ' comparator group ', ' habit learning ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' high risk ', ' critical period ', ' medical attention ', ' public health relevance ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' dexterity ', ' phenomenological models ', ' phenomenology ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' secondary analysis ', ' recruit ', ' support vector machine ', ' tic suppression ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,626493,MO-01
"COVID-19 Network of Networks Expanding Clinical and Translational approaches to Predict Severe Illness in Children (CONNECT to Predict SIck Children) The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has manifested in children with a wide spectrum of clinical presentations ranging from asymptomatic infection to devastating acute respiratory symptoms, appendicitis (often with rupture), and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), a serious inflammatory condition presenting several weeks after exposure to or infection with the virus. These presentations overlap in their clinical severity while maintaining distinct clinical profiles. Public health and clinical approaches will benefit from an improved understanding of the spectrum of illness associated with SARS CoV-2 and from the capacity to integrate data to achieve two goals: (i) to identify the clinical, social, and biological variables that predict severe COVID-19 and MIS-C, and (ii) to target those populations and individuals at greatest risk for harm from the virus. We propose the COVID-19 Network of Networks Expanding Clinical and Translational approaches to Predict Severe Illness in Children (CONNECT to Predict SIck Children) comprising eight partners providing access to data on >15 million children. Our network will systematically integrate social, epidemiological, genetic, immunological, and computational approaches to identify both population- and individual-level risk factors for severe illness. Our underlying hypothesis is that a combination of multidimensional data – clinical, sociodemographic, epidemiologic, and biological -- can be integrated to predict which children are at greatest risk to have severe consequences from SARS-CoV-2 infection. To test our hypothesis, we will develop CONNECT to Predict SIck Children, a network of networks that leverages inpatient, outpatient, community, and epidemiological data resources to support the analysis of large data using machine learning and model-based analyses. For the R61 phase, we will develop and refine predictive models using data from our network of networks (Aim 1). We will also recruit participants previously diagnosed with either COVID-19 or MIS-C (along with appropriate controls who have had mild or asymptomatic infections with SARS-CoV2), who will provide survey data (including social determinants) and saliva and blood samples to identify persisting biological factors associated with severe disease (Aim 2). We will iteratively assess our models using a knowledge management framework that considers the marginal value of data for improving models' predictive capacity over time. In the R33 phase, we will validate and further refine predictive models incorporating data from additional participants recruited throughout our network of networks, including newly infected children with severe COVID-19 or MIS-C identified through real-time surveillance (Aim 3). We seek to develop predictive models for children and adolescents that are useful, sensitive to community and environmental contexts, and informed by the REASSURED framework specified by the RFA. The models and biomarkers developed through our nationwide network of networks will produce generalizable knowledge that will improve our ability to predict which children are at greatest risk for severe complications of SARS-CoV- 2 infection. This knowledge will facilitate interventions to prevent and treat severe pediatric illness. PROJECT NARRATIVE COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, is a world-wide public health problem. Pediatric disease has been particularly difficult to manage since children tend less frequently to get sick from SARS-CoV-2 infection as adults but, when they do become ill, can present with life-threatening pulmonary disease or a systemic inflammatory condition known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome. The proposed COVID-19 Network of Networks Expanding Clinical and Translational approaches to Predict Severe Illness in Children (CONNECT to Predict SIck Children) will develop models and biomarkers that predict risk for severe disease in children and adolescents by systematically integrating social science, epidemiological, genetic, biochemical, immunological, and computational

"Identifying biomarker signatures of prognostic value for Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT In adults, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits a wide range of clinical outcomes, from asymptomatic and mild disease to severe viral pneumonia, respiratory distress, acute kidney injury, thrombotic disorders, and serious cardiac, cerebrovascular and vascular complications. Severe infection can also occur both in children and young adults (< 21), and a significant proportion of children admitted with Covid-19 require ICU support, frequently including mechanical ventilation. In addition, children and adolescents with initially asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection have presented with a rare, but very severe multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). Epidemiologic, clinical and laboratory predictors of progression towards severe forms of acute infection with SARS-CoV-2 and MIS-C are thus urgently needed in the fight against Covid-19 in this population. As defined in the NIH Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx) program, biomarker discovery can enable risk stratification and guide interventional studies to target Covid-19 patients at enhanced risk of developing complications and/or severe disease. To target this discovery initiative, herein we will use a battery of biological, immunological and molecular tests, including Grating-Coupled Fluorescence Plasmonic (GCFP) and advanced flow cytometry, to study children and young adults (<21 years) with mild, moderate or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. GCFP allows the use of disposable biosensor chips that can be mass-produced at low cost and spotted in microarray format to greatly increase multiplexing capabilities. In addition, we will use a similar biomarker approach for rapid differentiation of patients with MIS-C versus other pediatric infectious or inflammatory conditions where the clinical presentation resembles MIS-C, most importantly Kawasaki disease. A child’s biologic and immunologic response to SARS-CoV-2 exposure is likely influenced by a variety of factors, including genetics, epigenetics and products of the mucosa/gut-brain axis, adipose tissue and neuroendocrine immune network, and further modulated by environmental exposures. With these factors in mind, we hypothesize that a child’s biomarker profile in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection enables a timely and accurate prediction of severity of Covid-19 and diagnosis of MIS-C, and will help guide treatment strategies, and predict patient outcomes. To test this hypothesis, we will use a non-traditional diagnostic and comprehensive biomarker discovery to characterize the clinical and laboratory spectrum of children and adolescents with mild, moderate and severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as MIS-C. We will then validate our newly developed diagnostic and prognostic algorithm to distinguish MIS-C from other inflammatory disorders with overlapping clinical manifestations, including Kawasaki disease, and predict the longitudinal risk of complications. PROJECT NARRATIVE SARS-CoV-2 infection has harshly impacted health care outcomes in children and young adults. This groundbreaking project will employ multiple state-of-the-art technologies and approaches to evaluate children and young adults (<21), enrolled in the United States and Colombia, across the spectrum of clinical manifestations of Covid-19 to identify and validate biomolecules or bacterial signatures with diagnostic and prognostic value.",Identifying biomarker signatures of prognostic

"Diagnosis of MIS-C in febrile children PROJECT SUMMARY The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and resultant pandemic of COVID-19 disease has overwhelmed global health systems and led to over 200,000 American deaths to date. While initial reports suggested that SARS- CoV-2 infection in children was generally benign, a novel post-inflammatory syndrome known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has now been described. MIS-C in children is characterized by fever, systemic inflammation, and end-organ involvement, and the majority of patients are IgG seropositive for SARS- CoV-2. Because the clinical features of MIS-C overlap with other infections and inflammatory disorders, new strategies for diagnosis of MIS-C in febrile children are urgently needed. Our immediate objective (during the R61 phase) is to determine the reproducible changes in breath, urine, and salivary volatile composition in chil- dren diagnosed with MIS-C. We will integrate these discovery studies with clinical and immunological profiling to develop (during R61 phase) and validate (during R33 phase) a novel and much-needed MIS-C diagnostic, which is expected to have a major impact on care of febrile children. Our long-term goal to develop a diagnostic strategy to distinguish children with MIS-C from children with other causes of fever. Supported by our strong preliminary data that indicate our expertise and feasibility of this strategy, our objectives will be met through three specific aims: 1) Characterize breath biomarkers in children with MIS-C (R61); 2) Relate breath VOC changes to virolog- ical, disease severity, and immunological features of MIS-C (R61); and 3) Validate our novel MIS-C diagnostic for clinical use (R33). The proposed research is significant, because we will progress in development of new, much-needed MIS-C rapid diagnostic tool. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research is highly relevant to public health because there is no current validated diagnostic tool for the post-SARS-CoV-2 inflammatory disorder in children, MIS-C. Our proposal will develop a new strategy to diagnose this disorder, which will directly improve care of children with fever and help support future clinical studies.",Diagnosis of MIS-C in febrile

"Identifying adolescents at high risk of neurocognitive disorder: Development and validation of a composite risk index Project Summary  More than 1 in 3 children from lower middle income countries (LMIC) are cognitively impaired and at risk of neurocognitive disorder (ND) due to malnutrition, immune dysfunction, HIV, and poverty-associated parasitic infections. All LMIC children – including HIV unexposed uninfected (HUU), are at risk of ND but HIV-infected and HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) are at elevated risk. Presently, there is no reliable approach to separate these vulnerable children along the continuum of risk for new-onset/progressive ND. This problem prevents risk-stratification, timely identification and targeting of at-risk children for ND remediation or prevention interventions. This project solves these problems by defining and validating a composite risk index (CRI) that integrates rigorously identified ND risk factors based on prior research to predict future new or progressive ND. The risk factors include malnutrition, immune dysfunction and HIV status. These factors will be combined into the CRI using modern machine learning methods and longitudinal data available from established cohort of 750 Ugandan children age 6 – 18 years (250 PHIV, 250 HEU and 250 HUU). For HEU and HIV-infected children this index will be refined into CRI-HEU and CRI-HIV, respectively, to include applicable maternal ART, child's viral genome, and cART factors.  Preliminary data from this cohort have demonstrated that cognitive indices vary significantly within the 12 months reassessment period. Additional preliminary data shows that despite HAART, chronic-HIV infection as well as nutritional, immunologic, and viral genome factors are associated with deficits in executive function, psychosocial adjustment, and quality of life. We now propose to follow this already established cohort every 12 months to collect additional data at 0, 12, 24 and 36 months to be used in defining and validating CRI. CRI will be used to predict new-onset/progressive ND during follow-up. Specific aims include: 1. To develop a CRI by combining intake data on nutrition, immune parameters and HIV status and their  interactions and perform internal and external validation of CRI as predictor of ND at 12 months. 2. To further internally and externally validate CRI for “out-of-time-window” prediction from 24 to 36 months. 3. For HEU and HIV-infected children, to refine CRI into CRI-HEU and CRI-HIV, respectively, by including  type of maternal ART, viral genome parameters, current cART regimen/adherence (as applicable), and  their interactions. Overall Impact: This project advances the science needed to ensure that all children survive and thrive neurodevelopmentally whether HIV-infected, HEU, or HUU through establishment of predictive index for ND. Modifiable factors that are found to be driving this index can become potential targets for novel therapeutic strategies and behavioral interventions to mitigate the high burden of ND and/or HAND –if HIV infected. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE This project will define and validate a prognostic tool for proactively identifying children at elevated risk of neurocognitive disorder (ND) and/or HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) in order to produce knowledge that informs targets for interventions to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes and minimize ND/HAND. For the first time, established multiple separate risk factors for impaired neurodevelopment will be integrated to define a composite risk index based on factors of malnutrition and immune dysregulation. The index will then be refined for HIV-infected and HIV exposed uninfected children by incorporating maternal ART and HIV-specific factors – complications of long-term antiretroviral therapy and HIV-virus genetic factors. 0925-0001/0002 (Rev. 08/12) Page 1 of 1 Continuation Format Page",Identifying adolescents at high risk of neurocognitive disorder: Development and validation of a composite

"Neural mechanisms of successful intervention in children with dyslexia Reading instruction prompts the emergence of neural circuits that are specialized for rapidly translating printed symbols into sound and meaning. Understanding how these circuits differ in children with dyslexia, and change with learning, is an important scientific challenge that holds practical implications for education. The proposed research employs longitudinal measurements in children with dyslexia over the course of a highly effective intervention program to: (a) determine how brain structure and function change in response to reading instruction; and (b) investigate neurobiological factors that predispose a child to struggle or succeed in the intervention. Thus, this proposal seeks to determine both how education shapes brain development, and how a child’s unique neurobiology predicts educational outcomes. Aim 1) White matter plasticity and learning – White matter was previously considered static infrastructure; it is now known that many cellular properties of the white matter change with learning. Reading interventions provide a powerful tool to study experience-dependent plasticity in the human brain. Based on novel quantitative MRI and diffusion MRI measurements developed by the PI and collaborators, it is now possible to quantify changes in cell density, intra-axonal water and myelination at millimeter resolution. Longitudinal measurements collected before, during, and after the intervention will be used to model the time-course of white matter plasticity associated with improvements in reading skills, and investigate the biological mechanisms that underlie differences in learning among children. Aim 2) Bottom-up and top-down computations in the reading circuit - When our eyes fixate upon a word, a cascade of neural processes is initiated, beginning in the visual system and progressing through a series of computations that translate the visual representation into sound and meaning. We have developed the first model of the neural computations performed by critical components of the brain’s reading circuitry. Based on this new understanding of computations in the literate adult brain, we will investigate how computations differ in children with dyslexia, and change in response to reading instruction. Aim 3) Neural biomarkers of learning outcomes - Even in a controlled and intensive learning environment, some children show substantial improvements in reading skill, while others show limited change. What biological factors predispose a child to excel or struggle when provided a high-quality intervention? Pre- intervention MRI measurements will be examined as predictor variables for individual differences in intervention learning rate, and long-term, post-intervention outcomes. Aim 3 will capitalize machine learning to develop a model of the neuroanatomical factors that predict learning outcomes. Dyslexia, an impairment in accurate or fluent word recognition, is the most common learning disability affecting roughly ten percent of children. This proposal capitalizes on cutting edge neuroimaging methods, in combination with carefully controlled educational interventions and behavioral measurements, to generate a new understanding of how successful intervention shapes the development of the brain circuits that support skilled reading. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms of successful remediation of dyslexia, and individual differences in learning, will pave the way for personalized approaches to dyslexia treatment.",Neural mechanisms of successful intervention in children with dyslexia,10220094,R01HD095861,"['Orthography ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' brain shape ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' post intervention ', ' Instruction ', ' remediation ', ' Outcome ', ' Individual Differences ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Coupled ', ' Impairment ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' neural model ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' white matter change ', ' effective intervention ', ' successful intervention ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' brain remodeling ', ' cognitive task ', ' educational atmosphere ', ' classroom environment ', ' college atmosphere ', ' collegial atmosphere ', ' collegiate atmosphere ', ' education atmosphere ', ' educational environment ', ' intellectual atmosphere ', ' learning atmosphere ', ' learning environment ', ' school atmosphere ', ' school climate ', ' training atmosphere ', ' university atmosphere ', ' learning outcome ', ' personalized approach ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' precision approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Axon ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Myelin Sheath ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neuroglia ', ' Glia ', ' Glial Cells ', "" Kolliker's reticulum "", ' Neuroglial Cells ', ' Non-neuronal cell ', ' Nonneuronal cell ', ' nerve cement ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Predisposing Factor ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' sound ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual Cortex ', ' visual cortical ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Measures ', ' Cell Density ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' Measurement ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' millimeter ', ' Hour ', ' Severities ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Word Blindness ', ' Dyslexia ', ' Visual System ', ' Visual system structure ', ' experience ', ' myelination ', ' phonology ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' intervention program ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' literate ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Modality ', ' Learning disability ', ' Learning Disabilities ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' ']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,532331,CA-18
"Longitudinal Study of Brain Imaging and Cognitive Markers of Tourette Syndrome in Children PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Chronic tic disorders (referred to here as Tourette syndrome: TS) are complex and often serious neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by motor and/or vocal tics. Tics are brief, repetitive, unwanted movements or noises, which can severely impinge upon quality of life. While TS was once thought to be relatively rare, recent epidemiological studies find that 1-6% of all children meet criteria for a chronic tic disorder, making it a significant public health problem. Typically in TS, tics begin around age 5-7 years old, peak in severity around age 10-12 years, and improve throughout adolescence into adulthood. However, not all patients show this improvement during adolescence, as ~30% continue to experience significant impairment into adulthood. Thus, the years during and immediately following peak symptom severity represent a critical time for TS, during which individuals may show considerable improvement or not. Surprisingly little research has targeted this critical developmental stage of TS. Moreover, longitudinal investigations of predictors of TS outcome have focused primarily on single variables (e.g., caudate nucleus volume or tic severity). Yet there is considerable evidence that the neurobiology of TS is quite complex, involving interactions within and between multiple brain networks. For example, our preliminary findings demonstrate stronger brain functional connectivity among cognitive control networks and motor networks, as well as altered white and gray matter volumes in prefrontal and subcortical regions in TS. Using this complex information may be more informative for understanding tic severity changes and predicting clinical outcome. We propose a longitudinal study in which we will capture the developmental stage of TS with the greatest likelihood of change in tic severity (beginning at age 10-12 years), and will follow these children to track the development of brain and cognitive features, and how they relate to symptom change, over time. To capture the complex neurobiology of TS, we will collect whole-brain resting state functional connectivity, structural MRI, cognitive, and clinical data from a group of children with TS. We will compare these children to tic-free controls (from the NIH's ABCD Study Washington University site subject pool), as comparison to typical development will be essential for interpreting longitudinal changes in TS. We will target diagnostic differences and developmental changes in specific functional brain networks, regional brain volumes, and cognitive abilities. We will also use multivariate machine learning methods to unify this rich dataset to classify and make predictions about individual children. This approach analyzes complex patterns of multidimensional data rather than single variables, providing the potential for clinical utility and to contribute converging evidence about mechanism. Identifying mechanisms underlying symptom change will provide insight into why many children with TS improve while some do not, potentially yielding new targets for treatment and predictive indicators of persistent tics. Markers of symptom improvement could be targeted to treat children who do not improve. Being able to make predictions about individual children could identify those children who need those interventions most. We have expertise with every step of the proposed study, but the application to longitudinal data over the first half of the second decade of life is novel. PROJECT NARRATIVE Children with Tourette syndrome (TS) follow varying clinical courses, as some will experience substantial improvement over the course of adolescence while others will continue to experience significant impairment. Understanding the brain and cognitive features that mediate or predict different outcomes could revolutionize prognosis and treatment. This project will study children with and without TS over time, during the key ages of 10 to 14 years, to (1) investigate how brain and cognitive markers of TS develop over adolescence and relate to changes in symptom severity, and (2) make predictions about future symptom severity for individual children.",Longitudinal Study of Brain Imaging and Cognitive Markers of Tourette Syndrome in Children,10220354,R01MH118217,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' caudate nucleus ', ' Nucleus Caudatus ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Future ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' putamen ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Tic disorder ', ' Time ', ' Gilles de la Tourette syndrome ', "" Gilles de la Tourette's Disease "", "" Guinon's disease "", ' Tic Disorder, Combined Vocal and Multiple Motor ', ' Tourette Syndrome ', "" Tourette's "", "" Tourette's Disease "", "" Tourette's Disorder "", "" Tourette's Syndrome "", ' maladie des tics ', ' tic de Guinon ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' Investigation ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' brain control ', ' mind control ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Motor Tics ', ' Vocal Tics ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' brain volume ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Outcome ', ' 7 year old ', ' 7 years of age ', ' age 7 years ', ' seven year old ', ' seven years of age ', ' 12 year old ', ' 12 years of age ', ' age 12 years ', ' twelve year old ', ' twelve years of age ', ' Impairment ', ' cognitive control ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' aggressive therapy ', ' aggressive treatment ', ' symptomatic improvement ', ' improve symptom ', ' symptom improvement ', ' longitudinal design ', ' epidemiologic data ', ' Epidemiological data ', ' Epidemiology data ', ' cognitive ability ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' multimodal data ', ' multi-modal data ', ' multi-modal datasets ', ' multimodal datasets ', ' multidimensional data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2021,559759,CA-52
"THE PRETERM BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE: TRAJECTORIES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY & CHANGES IN CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY PROJECT SUMMARY: Children born prematurely are at elevated risk for psychiatric disorders, including ADHD, autism and anxiety. Indeed, the ‘preterm behavioral phenotype’ is comprised of inattention, anxiety and social- communication impairments. This constellation of comorbid disorders persists across the lifespan, accounting for long-term impairment and diminished quality of life among very preterm (VPT; born ≤32 weeks gestation) children, a population at high risk for altered brain development. Yet, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the increased prevalence of these symptoms remain undetermined. Further, VPT children face high exposure rates to deleterious psychosocial risk factors which have similarly been linked to adverse psychiatric outcomes and changes in brain development. We posit that decreased connectivity and the resulting diminished developmental trajectories within and across key functional networks (e.g., default mode, frontoparietal control and cingulo-opercular networks) and related white matter tracts (e.g., cingulum, corpus callosum and uncinate) underlie comorbid preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms that persist or worsen at age 9-10. This process begins during infancy and extends to middle childhood, with psychosocial risk playing an important modifying role. Advances in MRI methodology now enable characterization of structural and functional brain networks with unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we couple these highly innovative, state-of-the-art MRI techniques with detailed psychiatric assessments to study our unique, sociodemographically-diverse longitudinal cohort of VPT and term-born children (N=302) with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10. The cohort has been followed since birth, including prospective collection of high-quality neonatal functional and structural connectivity MRI data and longitudinal assessments of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms and psychosocial and familial factors at ages 2 and 5, with >80% cohort retention to date at both assessment waves. Continued evaluation of this enriched cohort provides an opportunity to determine: 1) trajectories of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms to define early indicators of later impairment enabling targeted interventions, 2) relationships between neonatal and age 9-10 functional and structural connectivity and these deficits, and 3) the modifying role of psychosocial adversity. Application of cutting-edge MRI acquisition and analysis methods, including machine learning approaches, enables unprecedented characterization of the effects of VPT birth on connectivity in the developing brain. We will extend these methods to delineate relationships between imaging measures and preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms, improving understanding of modifiable effects of early life exposures and psychosocial risk on psychiatric outcomes. These data are critical for developing individual- level neuroimaging, behavioral and psychosocial presymptomatic predictive models for adverse mental health outcomes, measures necessary to inform and evaluate treatments applicable during sensitive developmental periods which mitigate risks of psychopathology associated with prematurity and psychosocial adversity. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH This study is designed to improve our understanding of the changes in brain structure and function that underlie the elevated rates of inattention, anxiety and autism spectrum symptoms now increasingly recognized in prematurely-born children. Using cutting-edge magnetic resonance imaging methods, we will investigate these relationships in a unique, longitudinally-studied cohort of very preterm and term-born children with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10 years and previously studied using neuroimaging during infancy and detailed assessments of psychiatric symptoms during early childhood. The overarching goal is development of new approaches for earlier, more accurate identification of children at risk for these disorders, enabling progress toward targeted interventions which improve outcomes by limiting risks for psychopathology associated with prematurity and psychosocial adversity.",THE PRETERM BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE: TRAJECTORIES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY & CHANGES IN CEREBRAL

"Data-driven multidimensional modeling of nonverbal communication in typical and atypical development ABSTRACT This proposal will develop innovative technology for data-driven, multimodal characterization of nonverbal communication (NVC) in typical and atypical development. Prior research has provided qualitative descriptions of the development of children's use of gaze and gesture to regulate social interactions, but there are no objective, automated tools for measuring NVC behaviors, nor computational models to explain their coordination and timing in social interactions. This proposal will apply advanced probabilistic modeling techniques from machine learning and data mining to a rich corpus of children's behavior, including automated measures of children's posture, head pose, gaze direction, arm movements, and hand configurations derived from color and depth cameras and accelerometers. By automatically learning probabilistic latent variable models from movement data, we will obtain compact, data-driven descriptions of NVC and its coordination in children with autism, children with developmental delays without autism, and typically developing children (Aim 1). We will validate our models by demonstrating their ability to predict children's behavior, including diagnostic group and one-year language outcomes (Aim 2). We will test whether novel NVC patterns can be uncovered with bottom-up clustering of motor movement data (Aim 3). We predict our models will have greater explanatory and predictive power compared to current measures of NVC, which are typically human-coded behaviors that are descriptive, but rely on a-priori definitions of higher level behaviors. The models we develop will capture the fine-grained structure, coordination, and timing of NVC behaviors during social interactions, and thus allow us to characterize these behaviors with an unprecedented level of detail. Because interventions for young children with ASD target NVC skills, our automated measurement tools will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to assess the extent to which these treatments are efficacious. In addition, automated tools for dense measurement of fine-grained changes in NVC would enable clinicians to assess profiles of strengths and weaknesses for purposes of treatment planning, to dynamically tailor treatment to clients' changing abilities, and ultimately to accurately capture whether treatment is working. Finally, the measurement capabilities will provide researchers with a novel, cost-effective approach to analyze video recordings, at a scale that is not currently feasible due to a reliance on human coding.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 68 children in the US. This project is focused on developing automated tools to characterize behaviors considered to be core, early emerging markers of autism, and that represent common treatment targets in this group. This has clear implications for identifying those at risk for autism and for ongoing clinical care.",Data-driven multidimensional modeling of nonverbal communication in typical and atypical development,10188635,R01MH114999,"['Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Child Behavior ', ' Child Development ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Client ', ' Color ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Future ', ' Gestures ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Head ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Nonverbal Communication ', ' non-verbal communication ', ' paralinguistic behavior ', ' Posture ', ' Production ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Video Recording ', ' Videorecording ', ' video recording system ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' Developmental Delay Disorders ', ' Developmental Delay ', ' Specific Child Development Disorders ', ' autistic children ', ' children with ASD ', ' children with autism ', ' children with autism spectrum disorder ', ' base ', ' communication behavior ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Series ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Stream ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Visit ', ' gaze ', ' innovative technologies ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' treatment planning ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' joint attention ', ' cost effective ', ' social communication ', ' public health relevance ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' clinical care ', ' common treatment ', ' individualized medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapeutic strategy ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' arm movement ', ' Accelerometer ', ' accelerometry ', ' activity monitor ', ' activity tracker ', ' recruit ', ' Grain ', ' language outcome ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' efficacious treatment ', ' efficacious therapy ', ' ']",NIMH,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,333604,GA-05
