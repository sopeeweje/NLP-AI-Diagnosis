"Automated Molecular Identity Disambiguator (AutoMID) PROJECT SUMMARY Small molecules are one of the most important classes of therapeutics alleviating suffering and in many cases death for hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Small molecules also serve as invaluable tools to study biology, often with the goal to validate novel targets for the development of future therapeutic drugs. Reproducibility of experimental results and the interoperability and reusability of resulting datasets depend on accurate descriptions of associated research objects, and most critically on correct representations of small molecules that are tested in biological assays. For example, it is not possible to develop predictive models of protein target - small molecule interactions if their chemical structure representations are not correct. Many factors contribute to errors in reported chemical structures in small molecule screening and omics reference databases, scientific publications, and many other web-based resources and documents. Because of the complexity of representing small molecules chemical structure graphs and the lack of thorough curation, errors are frequently introduced by non-experts and error propagation across different digital research assets is a pervasive problem. To address this challenging problem via a scalable approach, we propose the Automated Molecular Identity Disambiguator (AutoMID). AutoMID will be usable in batch mode at scale via an API, for example to assist chemical structure standardization and registration by maintainers of digital research assets, and also via interactive (UI) mode for everyday researchers to quickly and easily validate or correct their small molecule representations. AutoMID will leverage extensive highly standardized linked databases of chemical structures and associated information including names, synonyms, biological activity and physical properties and their sources / provenance and leverage expert rules and AI to enable reliable disambiguation of chemical structure identities at scale. PROJECT NARRATIVE Small molecules are one of the most important types of drugs. They also serve as invaluable tools to study biology.

"Interplay of inherent promiscuity and specificity in protein biochemical function with applications to drug discovery and exome analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Although the past two decades witnessed the large-scale analyses of cellular components, e.g. exomes, their impact on drug discovery and precision medicine has been modest. For example, 6/7 drug candidates failed safety and 3/4 failed efficacy in recent FDA clinical trials. These unsolved, but related issues, safety and efficacy, reflect significant gaps in understanding of the triangular interrelationship between diseases, molecular function, and drug treatments. A key conceptual limitation of contemporary drug discovery is the often implicitly assumed single drug for a single protein target disease model. In reality, most diseases are caused by multiple malfunctioning molecules. Whether it be disease treatment or precision medicine diagnostics, there is often an inability to identify disease-associated mode of action (MOA) proteins. To begin to address these issues, in the current MIRA proposal, we developed a promising protein structure and network-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach, MEDICASCY, to predict disease-associated MOA proteins, drug indications, side effects and efficacy; however, much more needs to be done. Here, we propose to build on our successes and develop an integrated AI-based approach, MEDICASCY-X, that addresses the following: The first step in determining a drug’s MOA and off-target interactions is to identity its protein targets. This requires the structures of all human proteins and their complexes. While we predicted suitable models for at least one domain in 97% of human proteins, using deep learning, we will predict the structures of the missing domains, domain-domain orientations and protein- protein complexes. We will extend small molecule virtual ligand screening (VLS) to predict binding affinities based on the insight that interacting ring-protein subpocket geometries and chemistry are conserved across protein families, are often privileged chemical structures and are likely low free energy complexes. Cryptic protein pockets, recently recognized as important drug targets, will be predicted and included in our VLS approach. Antibody-based immunotherapies are powerful but have similar safety and efficacy issues as small-molecules; thus, their safety and efficacy will be predicted by MEDICASCY-X. While MEDICASCY works on an “averaged human”, MEDICASCY-X will consider individual genetic and epigenetic profiles to make it a true precision medicine tool. We will predict which MOA proteins should be targeted and if a protein’s MOA is due to a loss or gain of function. The same framework will predict synergistic drug-drug interactions. Another way to prioritize MOA proteins is by disease comorbidity: proteins occurring in multiple diseases are likely important. If disease comorbidity can be predicted, we will construct the “Phylogenetic” Tree(s) of Diseases that would facilitate a deeper understanding of disease interrelationships. As proof of principle of the effectiveness of the algorithms being developed, novel preclinical treatments for a variety of intractable diseases will be developed. Thus, this project could enhance the success rates of drug discovery and precision medicine while reducing time and cost. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite the explosion of biological knowledge that has occurred since the turn of the century, the impact on drug discovery and precision medicine has been modest. To address the key issues limiting this success, this project will develop an AI-driven, integrated protein structure and interaction network-based approach, MEDICASCY-X, that will predict disease associated proteins, identify the most effective protein targets to treat the disease and suggest effective, de-risked therapeutic strategies. MEDICASCY-X will be applied to improve drug discovery and precision medicine and will be validated by developing novel preclinical treatments for a variety of intractable diseases.",Interplay of inherent promiscuity and specificity in protein biochemical function with applications to drug discovery and exome analysis,10149528,R35GM118039,"['Algorithms ', ' Antibodies ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Chemistry ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Explosion ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunotherapy ', ' Immune mediated therapy ', ' Immunologically Directed Therapy ', ' immune therapeutic approach ', ' immune therapeutic interventions ', ' immune therapeutic regimens ', ' immune therapeutic strategy ', ' immune therapy ', ' immune-based therapies ', ' immune-based treatments ', ' immuno therapy ', ' Ligands ', ' Proteins ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Specificity ', ' Time ', ' Trees ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Chemical Structure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' cryptic protein ', ' success ', ' Free Energy ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Drug Interactions ', ' Modeling ', ' drug discovery ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' protein complex ', ' Effectiveness ', ' small molecule ', ' Protein Family ', ' Address ', ' protein structures ', ' proteins structure ', ' protein structure ', ' Affinity ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Phylogenetic Analysis ', ' Phylogenetics ', ' Molecular ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' Network-based ', ' gain of function ', ' drug candidate ', ' exome ', ' exomes ', ' screening ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' Geometry ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' deep learning ', ' side effect ', ' ']",NIGMS,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R35,2021,490958,GA-05
"Quantifying the role of adaptation in olfactory coding through the logic of navigation Project Summary This project’s long-term goal is a fuller understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms of olfactory sensory adaptation that facilitate odor discrimination in the natural world. To confront the wide fluctuations in intensity and temporal variability that are characteristic of natural odor environments, animals have evolved refined neurosensory mechanisms for parsing behaviorally-relevant signals such as pheromones from background nuisance odors. This project seeks to elucidate how adaptive mechanisms in the olfactory periphery play a central role in this discrimination task. The project will utilize a novel behavioral assay that permits precise quantification of the logic used by insects in navigating complex, temporally dynamic odor environments. By combining this assay with data analytic methods and machine learning, a comprehensive lexicon of archetypal navigational strategies of insect odor navigation will be derived. Importantly, since both odors and insects can be simultaneously tracked in this assay, the project will uncover strategies employed by insects in not just static, but also fluctuating odor landscapes. By quantifying how these strategies modulate in time, the role of memory in shaping navigational strategies will also be determined. The project will then leverage this dictionary of navigational logic to quantify how various mechanisms of adaptation in Drosophila olfactory receptor neurons can shape odor discrimination. Importantly, this project will examine the role of olfactory sensory adaptation in an ethologically-relevant way, by connecting mechanisms that operate at the level of sensory input with neural computations that affect output behavior. Further, since the behavioral assay tracks complex odor environments simultaneous with freely-moving insects, the impact of behavior on future signal acquisition – behavioral feedback onto odor stimuli – is fully maintained. The behavioral experiments and data analysis in this project utilize the tractable, highly-characterized system of Drosophila melanogaster, in which a wealth of existing genetic tools will allow directed experimentation of specific adaptive mechanisms in olfaction. The results of this project will elucidate how insects effectively navigate complex odor environments, and how olfactory systems maintain sensitivity despite odor conflicts and temporal variability. Project Narrative This project will contribute to our understanding of how the olfactory sensory periphery and neural circuitry have evolved to effectively encode our vast and varied chemical environment. The project will help reveal how odor discrimination capability is maintained in natural odor landscapes, leading to practical interventional strategies for the control of disease vectors such as tsetse flies and mosquitos, who rely critically on their sense of smell to navigate. Chemical sensing is the only shared sensation among organisms as simple as bacteria and as complex as humans, and this project will enhance our fundamental knowledge of this universal sensory modality.",Quantifying the role of adaptation in olfactory coding through the logic of navigation,10105369,F32MH118700,"['Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Cues ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Dictionary ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease Vectors ', ' Drosophila genus ', ' Drosophila ', ' fruit fly ', ' Drosophila melanogaster ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Insecta ', ' Insects ', ' Insects Invertebrates ', ' Laws ', ' Logic ', ' Lymph ', ' lymphatic fluid ', ' Memory ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Culicidae ', ' Mosquitoes ', ' Motion ', ' Odors ', ' Olfactory Pathways ', ' Olfactory system ', ' olfactory circuitry ', ' olfactory circuits ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Pheromone ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Esthesia ', ' Sensation ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Smell Perception ', ' Olfaction ', ' Smell ', ' odor perception ', ' olfactory perception ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tsetse Flies ', ' Glossina ', ' odorant-binding protein ', ' odor-binding protein ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Mediating ', ' analytical method ', ' Left ', ' Olfactory Receptor Neurons ', ' Chemicals ', ' Stimulus ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Photosensitiveness due to sun ', ' sun sensitivity ', ' Photosensitivity ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' light intensity ', ' mutant ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disease control ', ' disorder control ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Characteristics ', ' Behavioral ', ' fly ', ' Flies ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' environmental change ', ' Behavioral Assay ', ' Impairment ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' optogenetics ', ' sensory input ', ' Data Analytics ', ' neurosensory ', ' neuro-sensory ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' preservation ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Bacteria ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' ']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,F32,2021,73562,CT-03
"Compound repositioning for Alzheimer's Disease using knowledge graphs, insurance claims data, and gene expression complementarity PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal focuses on the challenge of identifying drug repositioning candidates for Alzheimer’s Disease. The foundation of this work is the ReFRAME library, a set of ~13,000 compounds that includes nearly all small molecules that have been FDA-approved, reached clinical development, or undergone significant preclinical profiling. The ReFRAME library is being actively screened against a diverse cross-section of in vitro assays. This proposal pursues three distinct strategies for identifying repositioning candidates among the ReFRAME collection. First, we will create and mine a large and heterogeneous biomedical knowledge graph. We will use machine learning methods to identify repositioning candidates based on properties of the knowledge graph surrounding and joining each drug and disease. Second, we will mine a massive data set of insurance claims data for associations between drug use and the incidence or severity of Alzheimer’s Disease. Containing almost 7 billion medical claims and over 2 billion pharmacy claims, this data set represents the largest source of claims data available. Third, we will use concept of gene expression complementarity to identify repositioning candidates. We will generate a gene expression signature for every ReFRAME compound in three cell lines relevant to Alzheimer’s Disease, and we will screen for compounds that produce a signature that appear to reverse gene expression changes seen in Alzheimer’s Disease. After assembling repositioning candidates identified through all three of these methods, we will prioritize up to 100 compounds (or compound combinations) for further characterization and validation. These follow-up experiments will initially investigate the activity of these compounds in five cell-based assays to establish a mechanistic hypothesis on their mechanism of action in Alzheimer’s Disease. Secondary follow-up experiments may include validation in some combination of in vitro (including hiPSC-derived cerebrocortical neurons and/or organoids) and in vivo systems. We believe that the multifaceted approach described in this proposal offers the best possible chance at successfully identifying AD repositioning candidates. Moreover, this work will create methods and resources that will be useful to the broader scientific community, both for Alzheimer’s Disease and for other disease areas. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project focuses on discovering new treatments for Alzheimer’s Disease. We specifically are looking for drugs that are already approved (or were previously tested) to treat other diseases to see if they can be beneficial for Alzheimer’s Disease patients. We will make and test predictions about which chemical compounds will have benefit, either alone or in combination.","Compound repositioning for Alzheimer's Disease using knowledge graphs, insurance claims data, and gene expression complementarity",10137167,R01AG066750,"[""Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Blue Cross ', ' Blue Shield ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Libraries ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Mining ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Organoids ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' medication prescription ', ' prescribed medication ', ' Publishing ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Work ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Severities ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Graph ', ' validation studies ', ' Property ', ' small molecule ', ' Data ', ' in vitro Assay ', ' in vivo ', ' Collection ', ' Validation ', ' trend ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Output ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' Expression Signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' gene expression signature ', ' transcriptional profile ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' FDA approved ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' screening ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' clinical development ', ' preclinical development ', ' pre-clinical development ', ' insurance claims ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' knowledge graph ', ' graph knowledge base ', ' graph knowledgebase ', "" Alzheimer's disease diagnosis "", "" Alzheimer's diagnosis "", "" Alzheimer's disease patient "", "" Alzheimer's patient "", ' ']",NIA,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,886543,CA-49
"Computational Explorations of Unconventional Approaches to Control Noncovalent Interactions PROJECT SUMMARY The research interests of my group are rooted in explorations of new and useful conceptual models to improve the control and prediction of noncovalent interactions. Our research involves the use of a variety of computational quantum chemical tools, applications of density functional theory (DFT), cheminformatics, and machine-learning methods. A premise of our research is that aromaticity may be used to modulate many types of noncovalent interactions (such as hydrogen bonding, π-stacking, anion-π interactions). The reciprocal relationship we find, between “aromaticity” in molecules and the strengths of “noncovalent interactions,” is surprising especially since they are typically considered as largely separate ideas in chemistry. The innovation of this research is that it will enable use of intuitive “back-of-the-envelope” electron-counting rules (such as the 4n+2πe Hückel rule for aromaticity) to make predictions of experimental outcomes regarding the impact of noncovalent interactions. A five-year goal is to realize the use of our conceptual models in real synthetic examples prepared by our experimental collaborators. My research vision is to bridge discoveries of innovative concepts to their practical impacts for biomedical and biomolecular research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research proposal includes four projects that are jointly motivated by the challenge to control and predict noncovalent interactions in organic and biomolecular systems. The proposed work involves applications of a variety of computational quantum chemical tools and synergistic investigations with experimental collaborators. We seek to identify new and useful concepts to guide experimental designs of novel “non-natural” molecular systems (e.g., receptors, biosensors, and hydrogels) that have potential biomedical applications.",Computational Explorations of Unconventional Approaches to Control Noncovalent Interactions,10220081,R35GM133548,"['Anions ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Chemistry ', ' Electrons ', ' Negative Beta Particle ', ' Negatrons ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Goals ', ' Hydrogen Bonding ', ' H-bond ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Chemicals ', ' Intuition ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' tool ', ' Investigation ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' biological sensor ', ' Biosensor ', ' Hydrogels ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' chemical informatics ', ' cheminformatics ', ' Research Project Summaries ', ' Molecular ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' quantum computing ', ' quantum coding ', ' quantum computation ', ' quantum error correcting codes ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R35,2021,370693,TX-18
"Developing an in vitro to in vivo pipeline of mammary gland exposure-response relationships to per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) Project Abstract  Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a family of over 5000 man-made chemicals that are ubiquitous in the environment, due to their chemical stability and bioaccumulative properties. Many of these “forever chemicals” have been linked with health concerns, including strong evidence of developmental health and harm to hormone-sensitive tissues. Manufacturers continue to substitute new PFAS for which exposure- based health risks are unknown. There is an urgent public health need to determine the effects of PFAS in use on both mammary gland development and increased breast cancer incidence. Current exposure studies use rodent models that require cumbersome end-point analyses as well as large monetary and time investments.  Our proposal is aimed at developing an in vitro to in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) pipeline of mammary gland development and maintenance to identify and prioritize potentially toxic PFAS, to ultimately mitigate number of animals needed for environmental exposure studies. Our approach is to develop in vitro models of the mammary gland of increasing complexity but decreasing throughput, identifying links between high-throughput and high- complexity model endpoint readouts to best prioritize large chemical libraries. A key technology to establish links across multiple in vitro culture platforms is optical coherence tomography-based structural-functional imaging (OCT-SFI), developed by MPI Oldenburg, which non-invasively visualizes label-free cells, their intracellular motility, and morphology of formed spheroids, within optically turbid tissue models.  Our first specific aim advances a high-throughput paper-based culture system, developed by MPI Lockett, to study mammary epithelial cell invasion in physiologically relevant tissue microenvironments. The platform will evaluate 96 different exposure conditions in parallel. Our second specific aim employs 3D co-culture models that include fibroblasts to model stromal signaling known to affect mammary gland development. OCT-SFI will provide cellular motility and morphology of the organotypic spheroids that form in these cultures. Finally, our third aim will screen a library of 40 PFAS, with a particular focus on the perfluoroethercarboxylic acids (PFECAs) currently used in industrial coatings. In addition, 12 PFAS will be screened for which there is existing in vivo rodent model data available, and comparisons between in vitro assay outputs and in vivo gland remodeling will be used to refine the assay models and establish initial thresholds for screening.  The models developed as part of this proposal will thus be predictive of biology, enabling the high-throughput capability needed for future screening of all PFAS as well as other emerging endocrine disruptors. The project’s risk is balanced by the known imaging capabilities of OCT-SFI to probe responses in 3D spheroid and paper- based co-cultures. The high-throughput nature of this IVIVE pipeline makes it ideal for screening libraries of potential toxicants, providing information-rich datasets of spatially and temporally resolved morphological and molecular changes across the tissue-like structures. Project Narrative This proposal aims to develop a pipeline to screen and prioritize libraries of potentially toxic man-made chemicals found in the environment for further analyses, with particular emphasis on per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) of which there are over 5000 currently known. Current environmental exposure testing methods evaluate mammary gland development in live mice because the mammary gland is highly susceptible to chemical exposure; yet, such methods are slow and expensive. Our proposal uses mammary cell culture models in increasingly complex, tissue-like environments, in combination with high-speed 3D optical imaging techniques, and ultimately compare the platform with a few candidate PFAS against existing data in live mice, setting the stage for future high-throughput screening of potential environmental toxicants.",Developing an in vitro to in vivo pipeline of

"Cannabinoid CB2 Receptor Structure and Allosteric Modulators Cannabinoid receptor subtype 2 (CB2) is a class-A family G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), located primarily in immune-associated tissues but also in specific regions of the brain, and implicated in several inflammatory diseases and addiction. Drugs targeting CB2 are attractive treatment alternatives for chronic neurological pain and neuroinflammatory autoimmune diseases since they avoid deleterious psychotropic effects that are associated with CB1. While drug development efforts have been primarily focused on small molecules targeting the orthosteric site, limitations of poor selectivity, lack of efficacy, and development of resistance have hampered such effort. At present, there is great interests in identifying GPCR allosteric modulators that either enhance (positive allosteric modulators, or PAMs) or inhibit (negative allosteric modulators, or NAMs) agonist-induced receptor activity. PAMs/NAMs often exhibit improved subtype selectivity and spatiotemporal sensitivity, as well as potential biased signaling properties compared to orthosteric ligands. We have recently reported a 3.2 Å cryo-EM structure of the agonist-bound human CB2-Gi complex. Based on such progress, the overall goals of this proposal are to obtain a structural understanding of CB2 allosteric modulation and use our integrated computational and experimental medicinal chemistry/biology approaches to design and synthesize novel allosteric modulators for the development of CB2-specific small-molecules with potential to treat CB2-associated maladies. Thus, we first propose to elucidate the structural basis for the action of CB2 allosteric modulators by cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography approaches. To achieve the goal, we will advance our established methods for structural studies on CB2 to obtain structure of CB2 with known PAMs or NAMs. Subsequently, we plan to perform in silico design of novel CB2 allosteric modulators by our established molecular fingerprint machine-learning (ML) computing algorithms and receptor docking approaches, on basis of our reported chemogenomics cannabinoid molecular information database (CBID) and 3D CB2-Gi cryo-EM structure; a virtual allosteric modulator library will be constructed using our fragment-based design (FBD) method and our established ML-classifiers and features-ranking will be applied for selection of virtual hits. Results will be correlated with CB2 structure-based modulator design via adapting the structural information obtained from our recent CB2-Gi cryo-EM structure and our novel molecular complex characterizing system (MCCS) algorithm. Finally, we will carry out medicinal chemistry synthesis of CB2 PAM and NAM ligands and validate them by radiometric binding and cellular functional assays. With the proof-of-evidence of our recent discovery of a putative CB2 NAM, successful completion of these Aims will provide unprecedented structural information on CB2 allosteric pockets, identify promising new CB2 allosteric modulators, and help to elucidate CB2 signaling and pharmacology.

"An informatics bridge over the valley of death for cancer Phase I trials of drug-combination therapies An informatics bridge over the valley of death for Phase I trials of drug-combination cancer therapies Summary Phase I studies usually focus on drug toxicity and pharmacokinetics, and most (58%) drugs intended as cancer therapies fail these initial trials. Thus, Phase I studies represent the largest valley of death in the course of drug development. Unlike the design of a single-drug Phase I study, the design of a drug-combination study requires prior knowledge of whether either drug changes the other’s drug exposure, the drugs share toxicities, and each drug has an established maximum tolerable dose. Although abundant toxicity and PK data are available in public domain sources, the data are not integrated, and no single database integrates data regarding both toxicity and PK. In addition, data regarding single-drug and drug-combination MTD and DLT are present in the literature but absent from any database. We are confident that a bridge can be built across the Phase I valley of death for cancer multi-drug research and development utilizing an informatics and pharmacometrics approach to take advantage of the abundant toxicity and PK data available for single drugs. In this grant, we propose a translational drug-interaction knowledgebase (TDCKB) that integrates toxicity and PK data. Aim 1 will develop novel active-learning approaches to mine evidence of toxicity and PK regarding drug interactions from the literature. The active learning methodology will employ several innovations, including random negative sampling, stratified active learning by prescreening based on PubMed query, and deep learning with embedding. The final active-learning method is optimized by a thorough integration of these innovative components. Aim 2 will develop a translational drug-interaction knowledgebase (TDCKB) for cancer research. The TDCKB will integrate toxicity and PK evidence for single drugs and drug combinations from various data sources. The evidence of DDI will be classified as either toxicity or PK, and the strength of the evidence will be annotated. Synthesized evidences, such as overlapping toxicity and predicted drug interactions between two drugs, will assist in Phase I drug combination trial design. Quality control will be conducted carefully during both data curation and TDCKB software development. Engagement of TDCKB users and the ITCR community is planned. Narrative Phase I studies usually focus on drug toxicity and drug exposure, which have the largest failure rate, 58%, of cancer drug development, i.e. valley of death. Because of complexity of cancer biology, they usually require multi-drug therapies. In order to overcome the valley of death for multi-drug cancer therapies, we propose an informatics bridge, i.e. a translational drug interaction knowledge base (TDCKB), that will integrate multi-drug exposure and toxicity data from various data sources. TDCKB will accelerate the translational cancer drug combination development research to the next phase of clinical trials.",An informatics bridge over the valley of death for cancer Phase I trials of drug-combination therapies,10305083,U01CA248240,"['Antineoplastic Agents ', ' Anti-Cancer Agents ', ' Antineoplastic Drugs ', ' Antineoplastics ', ' Cancer Drug ', ' Neoplastic Disease Chemotherapeutic Agents ', ' Tumor-Specific Treatment Agents ', ' anti-cancer drug ', ' anticancer agent ', ' anticancer drug ', ' Awareness ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Drug Combinations ', ' Drug Design ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Combination Drug Therapy ', ' Polychemotherapy ', ' combination chemotherapy ', ' combination pharmacotherapy ', ' combined drug therapy ', ' Drug toxicity ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Feedback ', ' Grant ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Quality Control ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Safety ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Public Domains ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Pharmacoepidemiology ', ' Pharmaceutical Epidemiology ', ' drug epidemiology ', ' pharmacoepidemiologic ', ' pharmacoepidemiological ', ' Failure ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Active Learning ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Oncologist ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Informatics ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' novel ', ' Drug Interactions ', ' Reporting ', ' Drug Exposure ', ' Sampling ', ' drug development ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' multi-modal cancer therapy ', ' multi-modal neoplasm therapy ', ' multimodality cancer therapy ', ' multimodality neoplasm therapy ', ' combination cancer therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer-directed therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' PubMed ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Dose-Limiting ', ' American Association of Cancer Research ', ' AACR ', ' American Society of Clinical Oncology ', ' ASCO ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Preparation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' anticancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' translational engagement ', ' phase 1 study ', ' Phase I Study ', ' phase I trial ', ' phase 1 trial ', ' trial design ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' cancer clinical trial ', ' oncology clinical trial ', ' translational impact ', ' deep learning ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' medication safety ', ' drug safety ', ' pharmaceutical safety ', ' pharmacometrics ', ' data curation ', ' Phase Ib Trial ', ' Phase 1b Trial ', ' ']",NCI,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,387617,OH-03
"Systematic Discovery of Bioactivation-Associated Structural Alerts Modified Project Summary/Abstract Section Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are dangerous and expensive. ADRS driven by immune-mediated hypersensitivity (including rashes, hepatotoxicity, and Steven-Johnson syndrome) are the most difficult to predict and occasionally can be severe as well as fatal. Hypersensitivity-driven ADRs are the leading cause of drug withdrawal and termination of clinical development. Yet a large proportion of drugs are not associated with hypersensitivity-driven ADRs, offering hope that new medicines could avoid these ADRs entirely if reliable models of bioactivation existed. Accurate prediction and identification of molecules prone to ADRs would revolutionize drug development by screening out ADR-prone candidates early, before exposure to patients, and guiding drug modifications to reduce ADR risk. Small molecules are not intrinsically immunogenic and instead, involve bioactivation into reactive metabolite is that then covalently modify proteins to create immunogenic antigens. “Structural alerts” are molecular substructures prone to bioactivation, and they are often used to identify small molecules prone to bioactivation, and at risk of bioactivation-mediated ADRs. Currently, bioactivation relevant alerts are defined by experts, and they have important limitations that this study overcomes. It is now possible to predict metabolism and reactivity and toxicity using machine learning approaches. Building on this foundation, this proposal systematically discovers new structural alerts by explicitly modeling the impact of metabolism on reactivity and hence the potential to form ADR-relevant adducts. We hypothesize that (1) known bioactivation reactions, (2) molecule citation data, and (3) new substructure mining algorithms can be used to identify emerging structural alerts. Aim 1. We will test this hypothesis by using a computational approach to systematically mine structural alerts from databases of known metabolism and reactivity reactions. Aim 2. We will computationally and experimentally validate structural alerts and assess their structural contingencies. Structural alerts are only conditionally bioactivated, depending on the precise molecule they appear. Newly proposed structural alerts, moreover, are most useful when there is experimental evidence that they in fact can be bioactivated.  PubHlthRel: Structural alerts discovered in this study will help scientists avoid toxic molecules in drug development, and better understand why medicines on the market become toxic. Overcoming a fundamental limitation with structural alerts, machine learning models of bioactivation will clarify in which molecules alerts are and are not bioactivated. This knowledge will help scientists make safer medicines in the future, modify existing medicines to make them safer, and reduce ADRs by using existing medicines more safely. Modified Public Health Relevance Section  Some medicines cause dangerous and expensive Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs), and many of these ADRs are caused by bioactivation. Structural alerts are substructures prone to bioactivation, and scientists use them to identify molecules prone to bioactivation mediated ADRs. Using a combined data-mining and experimental approach, this proposal systematically discovers emerging structural alerts of increased importance in recently studied molecules. Knowledge gained from these studies could foster improved dosing regimens for marketed drugs and enable scientists to design safer medicines.",Systematic Discovery of Bioactivation-Associated Structural Alerts,10260584,R01GM140635,"['Algorithms ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' Cell Death ', ' necrocytosis ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Exanthema ', ' Exanthem ', ' Rash ', ' Skin Rash ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Allergy ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Manuals ', ' Medicine ', ' Metabolic Activation ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Mining ', ' Chemical Models ', ' Patients ', ' Proteins ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stevens-Johnson Syndrome ', ' Erythema Multiforme Major ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Mediating ', ' drug withdrawal ', ' Acute Liver Failure ', ' Acute Hepatic Failure ', ' Fulminant Liver Failure ', ' Fulminating Hepatic Failure ', ' Fulminating Liver Failure ', ' fulminant hepatic failure ', ' improved ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Chemicals ', ' Hepatotoxicity ', ' Hepatotoxic effect ', ' Liver Toxicity ', ' Toxic effect on liver cells ', ' hepatic toxicity ', ' hepatoxicity ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Protein Binding ', ' bound protein ', ' Fostering ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Metabolic ', ' gene function ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Reaction ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' adduct ', ' drug modification ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Structure ', ' drug market ', ' Modeling ', ' drug development ', ' immunogenic ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' small molecule ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' in vitro Assay ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' protein function ', ' immunogenicity ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' public health relevance ', ' Regimen ', ' screening ', ' liver injury ', ' Injury to Liver ', ' hepatic damage ', ' hepatic injury ', ' liver damage ', ' Algorithm Design ', ' Algorithmic Design ', ' Algorithmic Engineering ', ' algorithm engineering ', ' algorithmic composition ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' clinical development ', ' deep learning ', ' adverse drug reaction ', ' ']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,375910,MO-01
"A Machine Learning Platform for Adaptive Chemical Screening Project Summary High-throughput screening remains the most common method to identify the primary chemical hits in chemical biology and drug discovery projects. However, large-scale screens are often financially out of reach for many academic labs. The resulting small screens of small chemical libraries often identify few confirmed hits, most of which are unsuitable for medicinal chemistry follow-up. There is a critical need for computational tools that can guide experimental screening at a reasonable cost while exploring far more chemicals. This proposal will develop a computational platform that can be applied to any target or phenotypic system to select compounds for experimental screening from virtual chemical libraries with a billion or more compounds. New machine learning and high-throughput computing methods will navigate this large chemical space strategically and efficiently, improving the quality of the identified compounds. The computationally guided screening can ultimately improve the chemical diversity, target specificity, and stability of the identified active compounds, accelerating and enabling drug discovery across NIH Institutes. The long-term goal of this research is to develop technologies that make chemical screening accessible to more research groups and enable drug discovery in any therapeutic area. Data science techniques can take advantage of existing public bioactivity data in PubChem to help prioritize chemical screening for a new target. In this technology development proposal, the researchers will 1) determine a general initial screening compound set, 2) develop a computationally-guided iterative screening system, and 3) create and experimentally validate an end-to-end high-throughput computing workflow that directs drug discovery for any new target. At each step, rigorous comparisons to experimental results and baseline models will ensure the methods are working as expected and offer capabilities that do not exist in the current state-of-the-art computational methods. The resulting computational platform will improve the efficiency of and reduce the barriers to chemical screening, ultimately making screening for new compounds available to academic research groups in ways and in places where it has previously been inaccessible. Project Narrative The proposed project is broadly relevant to public health as a critical advancement of technology to enable basic biomedical research across therapeutic areas. This effort creates a computational platform to reduce the overall cost and improve the quality of high-throughput screening in any chemical biology or drug discovery project, which will be rigorously compared to existing experimental techniques.

"Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria PROJECT SUMMARY Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections are increasing in incidence and novel antibiotics are urgently needed to combat this growing threat to public health. A major roadblock to the development of novel antibiotics is our poor understanding of the structural features of small molecules that correlate with bacterial penetration and efflux. As a result, while potent biochemical inhibitors can often be identified for new targets, developing them into compounds with whole-cell antibacterial activity has proven challenging. To address this critical problem, we propose herein a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to develop quantitative models to predict small-molecule penetration and efflux in Gram-negative bacteria. We have pioneered a general platform for systematic, quantitative evaluation of small-molecule accumulation in bacteria, using label-free LC-MS/MS detection and multivariate cheminformatic analysis. We have also developed unique isogenic strain sets of wild-type, hyperporinated, efflux-knockout, and doubly-compromised E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii that allow us to dissect the individual contributions of outer/inner membrane penetration and active efflux to net accumulation, using a kinetic model that accurately recapitulates available experimental data. Moreover, we have developed machine learning and neural network approaches to QSAR (quantitative structure–activity relationship) modeling of pharmacological properties that will now be used to develop predictive cheminformatic models for Gram-negative accumulation, penetration, and efflux. This project will be carried out by a multidisciplinary SPEAR-GN Project Team (Small-molecule Penetration & Efflux in Antibiotic-Resistant Gram-Negatives, “speargun”) involving the labs of Derek Tan (MSK, PI), Helen Zgurskaya (OU, PI), Bradley Sherborne (Merck, Lead Collaborator), Valentin Rybenkov (OU, Co-I), Adam Duerfeldt (OU, Co-I), Carl Balibar (Merck, Collaborator), and David McLaren (Merck, Collaborator), comprising extensive combined expertise in organic and diversity-oriented synthesis, biochemistry, microbiology, high- throughput screening, mass spectrometry, biophysical modeling, cheminformatics, and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we will design and synthesize chemical libraries with diverse structural and physicochemical properties; analyze their accumulation in the isogenic strain sets in both high-throughput and high-density assay formats; extract kinetic parameters for penetration and efflux from the resulting experimental datasets; develop and validate robust QSAR models for accumulation, penetration, and efflux; and demonstrate the utility of these models in medicinal chemistry campaigns to develop novel Gram-negative antibiotics against three targets. This project will provide a major advance in the field of antibacterial drug discovery, providing powerful enabling tools to the scientific community to address this major threat to public health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria pose a growing threat to public health in the U.S. and globally. A major obstacle to the development of new antibiotics to combat such infections is our poor understanding of the chemical requirements for small molecules to enter Gram-negative cells and to avoid ejection by efflux pumps. The proposed comprehensive, multidisciplinary research program aims to develop predictive computational tools to identify such molecules by carrying out large-scale, quantitative analyses of the accumulation of diverse small molecules in Gram-negative bacteria. These tools will then enable medicinal chemistry campaigns to develop novel antibiotics.",Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria,10226047,R01AI136795,"['inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Bacteria ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biological Availability ', ' Bioavailability ', ' Biologic Availability ', ' Physiologic Availability ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Pharmaceutical Chemistry ', ' Medicinal Chemistry ', ' Pharmaceutic Chemistry ', ' Communities ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Escherichia coli ', ' E coli ', ' E. coli ', ' Gram-Negative Bacteria ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Kinetics ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Libraries ', ' Microbiology ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Pseudomonas aeruginosa ', ' P aeruginosa ', ' P. aeruginosa ', ' Pseudomonas pyocyanea ', ' Public Health ', ' Quantitative Evaluations ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Testing ', ' Measures ', ' Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections ', ' Antibiotic Resistance ', ' Resistance to antibiotics ', ' Resistant to antibiotics ', ' antibiotic drug resistance ', ' antibiotic resistant ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Penetration ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biochemical ', ' Chemicals ', ' Individual ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Measurement ', ' analog ', ' Anti-Bacterial Agents ', ' Antibacterial Agents ', ' anti-bacterial ', ' antibacterial ', ' A baumanni ', ' A baumannii ', ' A. baumanni ', ' A. baumannii ', ' A.baumannii ', ' Acinetobacter baumanni ', ' Acinetobacter baumannii ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Oral ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' success ', ' cell envelope ', ' chemical library ', ' small molecule libraries ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' mate ', ' Partner in relationship ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' High Throughput Assay ', ' high throughput screening ', ' QSAR ', ' Quantitiative Structure Activity Relationship ', ' Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship ', ' drug discovery ', ' Effectiveness ', ' chemical informatics ', ' cheminformatics ', ' small molecule ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Mammalian Cell ', ' Knock-out ', ' Knockout ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' prospective ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' efflux pump ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' combat ', ' public health relevance ', ' screening ', ' Algorithmic Software ', ' Algorithmic Tools ', ' Software Algorithm ', ' biophysical model ', ' learning network ', ' lead optimization ', ' neural network ', ' kinetic model ', ' ']",NIAID,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2021,1239304,NY-12
"Administrative Supplement: Using machine learning to predict odor characteristics from molecular structure PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT We cannot yet look at a chemical structure and predict if the molecule will have an odor, much less what character it will have. The goal of the proposed research is to apply machine learning to predict perceptual characteristics from chemical features of molecules. The specific aims of the proposal will determine (1) which molecules are odorous , and (2) what data are needed to model odor character. Building a highly predictive model requires two key ingredients: high-quality data and a sound modeling approach. High-quality data must be accurate (ratings are consistent and describe true odor properties) and detailed (ratings describe even small differences in odor properties). We have collected human psychophysical data on a diverse set of molecules and have trained a model to predict if a molecule has an odor, but pilot data identified odorous contaminants that limit model training and measurement of model accuracy. In Aim 1, I will apply my background in analytical chemistry to evaluate the accuracy of the data, using gas chromatography to identify and correct errors caused by chemical contaminants. In Aim 2, I will apply my experience in human sensory evaluation to measure and compare the consistency and the degree of detail in ratings that can be achieved with different sensory methods and subject training procedures. By executing my training plan, I will develop the skills in statistical programming and machine learning needed to employ a sound modeling approach to these problems. The model constructed in Aim 1 will enable prediction of odor classification (odor/odorless) for any molecule and thus define which molecules are perceptually relevant. Predicting odor character is a far more complex challenge – while a molecule can have only one of two odor classifications (odor or odorless) it may elicit any number of diverse odor character attributes (fruity, floral, musky, sweet, etc.). Descriptive Analysis (DA) is the gold standard method for generating accurate and detailed sensory profiles, but this method is time-consuming. We estimate that an odor character dataset will be large enough (“model-ready”) to predict odor character with approximately 10,000 molecules and that it would require more than 30,000 hours of human subject evaluation, or approximately 6 years for the typical trained panel, to produce this dataset using DA. Before we invest the time and resources, it is responsible to evaluate the relative data quality of more rapid sensory methods. The results of Aim 2 are expected to determine the best approach for generating a model-ready dataset by quantifying trade-offs in degree of detail (data resolution), rating consistency, and method speed of five candidate sensory methods. Together, these aims represent a significant step forward in linking chemical recipe to human odor perception, an advancement that supports the NIDCD goal of understanding normal olfactory function (how stimulus relates to percept) and has many potential applications in foods (what composition of molecules should be present to produce a target aroma percept). PROJECT NARRATIVE Currently, scientists cannot predict whether a molecule will have an odor and, if so, what odor characteristics it will have based on its chemical structure. The goal of this project is to develop predictive models linking chemical composition to odor characteristics. These models will advance our understanding of the human olfactory system and help design strategies for improving the aroma and palatability of healthy foods.",Administrative Supplement: Using machine learning to predict odor characteristics from molecular structure,10405294,F32DC019030,"['Chemistry ', ' Analytical Chemistry ', ' Analytic Chemistry ', ' Gas Chromatography ', ' vapor phase chromatography ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Fruit ', ' dietary fruit ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Mass Fragmentography ', ' GC MS ', ' GCMS ', ' Gas-Liquid-Mass Spectrometry Chromatography ', ' Mass Fragmentographies ', ' Mass-Gas Chromatography Spectrometry ', ' Mass-Gas Chromatography Spectrum Analysis ', ' ion trap mass spectrometry ', ' mass fragmentometry ', ' Methods ', ' Molecular Structure ', ' Macromolecular Structure ', ' Odors ', ' Olfactory Pathways ', ' Olfactory system ', ' olfactory circuitry ', ' olfactory circuits ', ' Perception ', ' Psychophysics ', ' psychophysical ', ' Quality Control ', ' Research ', ' Research Technics ', ' Research Techniques ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Science ', ' Smell Perception ', ' Olfaction ', ' Smell ', ' odor perception ', ' olfactory perception ', ' sound ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Programmed Learning ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Chemical Structure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' data quality ', ' Measurement ', ' Descriptor ', ' Health Food ', ' healthy food ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Sensory ', ' experience ', ' Recipe ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' Palate ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' rapid method ', ' rapid technique ', ' food science ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Collection ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders ', ' NIDCD ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Consumption ', ' model building ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' ']",NIDCD,MONELL CHEMICAL SENSES CENTER,F32,2021,2500,PA-03
"Cyanobacterial pseudo-natural products for anticancer drug discovery PROJECT ABSTRACT Cyanobacteria produce secondary metabolites have been well-documented to possess potent and selective anticancer activity, which has resulted in FDA approval of a cyanobacterial antibody-drug-conjugate (ADC) for the treatment of several Hodgkin lymphomas. Even though this highlights the critical role of natural products in the drug discovery, the novelty of structural scaffolds has largely remained steady in the last two decades. Therefore, we aim to design and synthesize a pseudo-natural product library inspired by cyanobacterial metabolites with well-described anti-cancer activity to expand their molecular coverage. Our pseudo-natural product library will develop and describe uncharted chemical space that integrates privileged scaffolds while employing medicinal chemistry approaches, such as combinatorial chemistry and parallel synthesis. We will qualitatively and quantitatively characterize our library using modern computational, machine learning and metabolomic techniques, to compare it with natural products and FDA-approved drugs. The long-term goal of this research is to generate a chemical library rich in natural product scaffolds that are biased towards cancer tissue for drug discovery and development.

"Illuminating Function of the Understudied Druggable Kinome Project Summary/Abstract Kinases are among the most important drug targets and clinically significant kinase inhibitors have been developed for multiple diseases. A subset of kinases, the understudied dark kinases (DKs), have received little or no attention because foundational data on their biochemical and biological functions is not available. This proposal will collect such data by perturbing DKs genetically and with small molecules and then measuring the cellular consequences using multiplex proteomic, gene expression, metabolomic and imaging assays. A subset of DKs with potential links to human disease will be intensively studied as a means to qualify new therapeutic drug targets. Data collected in this project will be aggregated with existing information from previous NIH-funded large-scale structural and genomic projects to create a Dark Kinase Knowledgebase (DKK) that provides gene-by-gene and network-level information on the dark kinome and its interaction with other signal transduction and regulatory networks. Close coordination with the NIH LINCS project will ensure data interoperability and make efficient use of informatics tools. The DKK will be developed in collaboration with the IDG Knowledge Management Center (KMC), adhere to standards for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data, and be accessible to human users and machines (via an API). Commercially available DK reagents be validated and extended with new genetic and chemical tools provided to the Resource Dissemination Center (RDOC). The overall approach will be iterative, with simpler methods applied first (e.g. simple gene knockout) and more sophisticated methods subsequently (e.g. stable CRIPSRa/i) pursued by an interdisciplinary team of chemists, computational biologists, mass spectroscopists and pharmacologists working on five linked aims. Aim 1 will develop a computational algorithm for prioritizing DKs, develop and maintain the DKK, and perform network-level analysis on the kinome using supervised and unsupervised machine learning. Aim 2 will measure kinase abundance in normal and perturbed cells using parallel reaction monitoring with stable isotope dilution (PRM-SID) and RNASeq and data analyzed using network inference tools to provide insight into dark and light kinome in diverse cell types. Aim 3 will perturb DKs with genetic tools such as CRIPSR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout, CRIPSRa/i to induce more subtle-up and down regulation and inducible gene inaction. The impact on cell fate, morphology and signal transduction will then be determined using PRM-SID, phosphoproteomics, RNASeq, gene reporter assays, metabolomics profiling and highly multiplex single-cell imaging. Aim 4 will extend DK analysis to small molecule inhibitors by carefully profiling existing drugs against DKs and by designing and synthesizing new chemical ligands. Aim 5 will involve collaboration with other investigators to assay the expression and function of DKs in primary human cells and tissues relevant to the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative. All aims will be pursued in parallel for a progressively expanding resource of data and tools for continued study of DKs. Project Narrative/Health Relevance Advancing understanding of understudied kinases, a highly druggable class of proteins, will increase knowledge about signal transduction and control over cellular physiology and is likely to reveal a subset of proteins that should be advanced as targets for new therapeutic drugs.",Illuminating Function of the Understudied Druggable

"Machine Learning for Drug Response Prediction PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Finding new drugs in the seas of small molecules is a difficult task if no prior information is available. Our broad research goal is to develop innovative and accurate machine learning algorithms to predict the drug responses related to complex human diseases. Specifically, we pursue questions of how a cell line responds to a single drug and combinatorial therapies, from the perspective of biological networks and small-molecule chemoinformatics. One research goal is to understand and predict the cell line-specific responses through integrating a wide range of methods, including the propagation of drug effects via biological networks, matrix factorization of molecular profiles and chemoinformatic analysis of small molecules. We will deploy our algorithms to softwares and web servers, which will inform the downstream experimental design to identify the single and combinatorial drug candidates against human diseases. Our research program will contribute to accelerate the drug discovery process by in silico screening through large amount of potent chemicals. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Molecular targeted therapy is one of the most successful weapons against many complex human diseases.

"Algorithmic identification of binding specificity mechanisms in proteins Project Summary Variations in protein binding preferences are a critical barrier to the precision treatment of disease. When high resolution structures of a protein are available, and many isoforms of the protein have been connected to dif- fering binding preferences, it is possible in principle to model the structures of all isoforms and discover the mechanisms that cause variations in binding preferences. Unfortunately, this discovery process depends on human expertise for examining molecular structure, and given that hundreds of isoforms may exist, a human would be overwhelmed to objectively examine many similar isoforms. To fill this gap, this project will (A1) de- velop software that identifies structural mechanisms that cause differential binding preferences, categorizes similar structural mechanisms, and explains the mechanisms in English. The second aim of this project (A2) is to validate the software at a large scale on families of proteins that exhibit a variety of well-examined binding preferences, and through blind predictions with experimental collaborators. Our approach involves creating software that mimics the visual reasoning techniques employed by structural biologists when examining molecular structures. Not only are these techniques responsible for most major dis- coveries in structural biology, but they are also straightforward to understand by non-computational research- ers. This property will enable our software to immediately integrate into existing workflows at labs that do not focus on computational methods. This property also contrasts from existing methods, which generally output structural models, potential energies, p-values and structural scores which are difficult for non-experts to un- derstand or incorporate into their research. Often, an expert in biophysics is required to interpret the outputs so that they can be operationalized in laboratory environments. In preliminary results, our methods have already identified molecular mechanisms that govern specificity in several families of proteins. Verification against peer-reviewed experimentation has proven the preliminary results correct in almost all cases. Our methods have also been applied to make a blind prediction of binding mechanisms in the ricin toxin, which binds to and damages the human ribosome. With experimental collabo- rators, we showed that our methods correctly identified and predicted the roles of several amino acids with a hitherto unknown role in recognizing the ribosome. Using our methodological approach and our rigorous valida- tion strategy, this project will produce a highly validated, usable software package that will bridge a critical gap in the development of precision therapies and diagnostics. Variations in protein binding preferences are a critical barrier to precision medicine and precise diagnostics. We will develop software that will identify and categorize molecular mechanisms that cause these variations. The resulting insights will enable clinicians to more precisely select therapies to achieve superior outcomes.",Algorithmic identification of binding specificity mechanisms in proteins,10251944,R01GM123131,"['Algorithms ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Charge ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Feedback ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hydrogen Bonding ', ' H-bond ', ' Influentials ', ' Laboratories ', ' Ligands ', ' Literature ', ' Major Histocompatibility Complex ', ' Histocompatibility Complex ', ' Histocompatibility Complices ', ' Major Histocompatibility Complices ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Structural Models ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' Molecular Structure ', ' Macromolecular Structure ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Peptide Hydrolases ', ' Esteroproteases ', ' Peptidases ', ' Protease Gene ', ' Proteases ', ' Proteinases ', ' Proteolytic Enzymes ', ' Proteins ', ' Nicotinic Receptors ', ' Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors ', ' Research ', ' Ribosomes ', ' Ricin ', ' Castor Bean Lectin ', ' RCA 60 ', ' RCA60 ', ' Ricinus Communis Agglutinin II ', ' Ricinus Lectin ', ' Ricinus Toxin ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Serine Protease ', ' Serine Endopeptidases ', ' Serine Protein Hydrolases ', ' Serine Proteinases ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Toxin ', ' Tweens ', ' Universities ', ' HIV Protease ', ' HIV Proteinase ', ' HTLV-III Protease ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biochemical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Protein Binding ', ' bound protein ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' English Language ', ' Electrostatics ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' preference ', ' hydropathy ', ' mutant ', ' Isoforms ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' structural biology ', ' Hydrophobicity ', ' Potential Energy ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Property ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Protein Family ', ' Address ', ' protein structures ', ' proteins structure ', ' protein structure ', ' biophysical mechanism ', ' Biophysical Process ', ' Resolution ', ' Structural Biologist ', ' Ligand Binding ', ' Validation ', ' Hot Spot ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Docking ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Output ', ' Outcome ', ' blind ', ' Population ', ' therapy development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' prototype ', ' tumor ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' Precision therapeutics ', ' precision therapies ', ' precision treatment ', ' personalized diagnostics ', ' personalized diagnosis ', ' precise diagnostics ', ' precision diagnostics ', ' human-in-the-loop ', ' ']",NIGMS,LEHIGH UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,257752,PA-07
"Centralized assay datasets for modelling support of small drug discovery organizations Project Summary Collaborations Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was formed after identifying a need for software to assist academics and smaller companies in curating their data and discovery of new hits or lead optimisation. In the past two years the continued importance of artificial intelligence (AI) is apparent from the explosive growth in number of these companies and the increasing number of multi-million dollar deals with pharma using Machine Learning (ML) to assist in drug discovery. There is a heavy focus by these companies on the drug discovery modeling aspect but there is a continued unmet need and bottleneck in the curation of quality in vitro and in vivo data ADME/Tox data for ML as well as prospective testing to validate the technologies. In Phase I, we developed a prototype of Assay CentralÒ software and used this with a wide variety of structure activity data from sources both public and private, formatted and unformatted, with ~14 collaborators working on neglected, rare or common disease targets as well as used it for our internal drug discovery projects. In Phase I we also created error checking and correction software. We also built and validated Bayesian models with the datasets that were collected and cleaned. And, in addition, we developed new data visualization tools. The software can be used to create selections of these models for sharing with collaborators as needed and for scoring new molecules and visualizing the multiple outputs in various formats. In Phase II, we have developed Assay CentralÒ into a production tool which is easy to deploy, built on industry standard technologies, provided graphical display of models and information on model applicability. Importantly, we identified that customers wanted us to provide them with the results! We developed our fee-for-service consulting services model using Assay CentralÒ to solve their problems and this has expanded our revenues annually. In Phase II we evaluated additional ML algorithms and molecular descriptors with manually curated datasets as well as compared algorithms across over 5000 auto-curated datasets from ChEMBL. This illustrated the utility of access to multiple algorithms and how the Bayesian algorithm was generally comparable to these other ML algorithms. This also motivated us to develop new software to integrate these algorithms. We have also explored finding rare disease datasets and applying our data curation and ML approach to them. With these and additional collaborations, as well as internal projects on Alzheimer’s disease (through a NIH NIGMS supplement) we have been able to repurpose already approved drugs for several targets for this and other diseases. For multiple projects we have performed several rounds of model building and fed data back into the models to enable improved predictions. Finally, we have developed prototype tools to enable us to develop automated molecule designs, assess their synthesizability and perform retrosynthetic analysis. These combined efforts dramatically increased the number of projects we were able to work on (and ultimately publish to raise our visibility), created new spin off products as collections of models (MegaTransÒ, MegaToxÒ and MegaPredictÒ), molecule related IP, and generated employment. In Phase IIB we now propose a focus on steps to aid commercialization and further development of these technologies. We have identified that developing auto-curation software for dealing with complex biological data in unstructured databases will be a competitive advantage. We have also recognized that for many diseases we can have a complete or near complete collection of targets which may enable us to understand how a molecule may interfere with biological pathways from structure alone and this can be applied to complex diseases and “adverse outcome pathways” in toxicology. We also propose integrating state of the art multi-objective generative models for molecule design into our Assay Central computational software in order to complement our analog generation and retrosynthesis tools created in Phase II and aid in molecule optimization. We will validate this capability using some of the hit molecules identified in Phase II for different targets including human acetylcholinesterase. Assay Central would then have a full suite of integrated capabilities from data curation through to molecule design and retrosynthetic analysis and will enable us to attract larger deals with companies. Narrative In Phase II Collaborations Pharmaceuticals Inc. developed Assay CentralÒ software, applied it to build thousands of models using public and private drug discovery and ADME/Tox datasets and identified that the Bayesian algorithm performs comparably to other more advanced Machine learning (ML) algorithms. We have applied this modeling approach to rare and common diseases to identify new molecules to test and have identified active molecules through numerous prospective validations, leading to many patents and publications. We have also applied the trademarked Assay CentralÒ technology on consulting projects with pharmaceutical, consumer product and preclinical CRO companies, demonstrating it meets an unmet need and in the process generated revenues. As we have developed software to propose novel compounds for testing, that integrates our machine learning, molecule design and retrosynthesis we now propose extending our auto-curation to unstructured databases, integrating machine learning models for a disease pathway and the addition of multi- objective generative models in order to build out our Assay Central

"Combined computational and structural studies to create novel macromolecular recognition properties PROJECT SUMMARY The design of macromolecular binding interactions and complexes, and corresponding alteration of binding specificity, is a challenging endeavor that remains recalcitrant to computational approaches. This is true both for the creation of protein-protein complexes (which are driven by a enthalpic changes established primarily by stereochemical complementarity, balanced against large competing entropic changes) and for the redesign of protein-DNA complexes (which are heavily dependent upon DNA bending, hydrogen-bonds, electrostatic contacts, and the presence of solvent and counterions throughout the molecular interface). Over the past several years we have collaborated with several computational groups to help develop and validate computational approaches for the design and optimization of protein-protein recognition, protein-DNA recognition, and protein-small molecule recognition. Those studies have contributed to several new computational engineering approaches, including hybrid strategies that combine ab initio design of protein folds and binding sites, the ‘Rotamer Interaction Feld’ (RIF) docking protocol for efficient sampling of protein sequence and conformation, and novel parametric design approaches to create new tandem repeat proteins. We propose to continue this work through two specific aims to further develop and improve upon computational approaches for protein design. As part of this project, we will solve atomic resolution crystal structures of many selected and designed molecular complexes and provide them to our immediate collaborators as well as to a public structure prediction project, for computational prediction challenges. Aim 1. We will design and characterize novel self-associating circular tandem repeat proteins (using both de novo computational design and using high-throughput selections) and then further design them to undergo ligand-induced protein-protein association. Beyond the challenge of combining protein scaffold design and ligand binding design, the motivation for this aim is to determine the structural and mechanistic features of small molecule ligand-binding, and balance of forces, that facilitate ligand-induced protein-protein association. Aim 2. We will improve our understanding and ability to design novel protein-DNA recognition specificities and behaviors. To accomplish this, we will: (1) Systematically select and optimize a series of variants of a model DNA-binding protein, that display altered binding specificity across two regions of partially overlapping sequential clusters of basepairs and neighboring protein residues. (2) Determine the high-resolution structures and binding behavior of each construct. (3) Supervise blinded computational efforts, using multiple approaches, to predict the same structures. (4) Compare and analyze the results of computational predictions versus multiple computational prediction strategies to define features influencing predictive accuracy. For both aims, we will further exploit our crystallographic structures by computationally ‘reverse engineering’ each construct using validated protein structures, to further understand the performance of design approaches.

"Maximizing the predictive power of high-throughput, microscopy-based phenotypic screens PROJECT SUMMARY We currently have an unprecedented ability to profile the genetic- and pathway-level changes that occur in cancer. Yet, clinicians lack the diverse arsenal of drugs needed to treat subpopulations of patients more effectively, reduce side effects and offer second-line treatment when drug resistance emerges. There is a pressing need to dramatically increase the repertoire of drugs available to fight cancer. Advances in automated microscopy and computer vision, allow the widespread use of phenotypic profiling in early drug discovery. In this grant, we address two challenges. First, the power of phenotypic profiling has led to a growing number of large, disparate image datasets. In aim 1, we will develop machine-learning approaches that combine disparate datasets to obtain accurate predictions of uncharacterized compound function. Second, phenotypic screens can identify candidate compounds across multiple, diverse pathways, but often only use a single cancer cell line. In aim 2, we will develop strategies to identify minimal collections of cell lines that maximize detection of small molecule activities. Successful execution will: increase the power of phenotypic profiling by harnessing existing phenotypic screening datasets and providing a rational approach for selecting cell lines that maximize the chance of discovering hits in desired pathways. In this proposal, we will develop computational and experimental methods to maximize the power of high-throughput, microscopy-based phenotypic screens. Our studies will increase the power of phenotypic profiling by harnessing screens performed across the world, providing a rational approach for maximizing the chance of discovering hits for diverse pathways in future screens, and identifying novel compounds that expand our ability to perturb cancer-relevant pathways. Our proposal is designed to accelerate the pace of early drug discovery.","Maximizing the predictive power of high-throughput, microscopy-based phenotypic screens",10090573,R01CA184984,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug resistance ', ' drug resistant ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Methods ', ' Microscopy ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Time ', ' Generations ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Chemicals ', ' Chemical Structure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Active Learning ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Funding ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' fighting ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Proteomics ', ' drug discovery ', ' Cell Cycle Control ', ' Cell Cycle Regulation ', ' chemical genetics ', ' small molecule ', ' Address ', ' Detection ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Collection ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Cancer cell line ', ' cancer type ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' transcriptomics ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' new drug target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new therapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' screening ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' proteostasis ', ' protein homeostasis ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' imaging approach ', ' imaging based approach ', ' druggable target ', ' Drug Screening ', ' deep learning ', ' side effect ', ' ']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,1,CA-12
"Increasing NF1 Expression as a Treatment for NF1 Haploinsufficiency Project Abstract Haploinsufficiency plays a crucial role in Neurofibromatosis (NF1), an autosomal dominant genetic disorder impacting over 120,000 individuals in the United States. Current therapeutic approaches focus on specific components of NF1 signaling, for example inhibiting MEK signaling pathways in tumors, thus failing to address the broad range of signaling and symptoms associated with NF1. Given that NF1 is characterized by both autosomal dominance and haploinsufficiency (lack of normal protein), upregulating protein expression of the remaining wild-type NF1 allele has the ability to compensate for loss of function from the mutant allele, thus alleviating a broad range of NF1 symptoms and overall disease progression. Infixion proposes to build a luciferase reporting assay to evaluate NF1 expression against known drugs, including 50+ compounds, across six drug classes, already identified by Infixion to correlate with increased NF1 expression. By confirming that these candidate drugs activate NF1 transcription, increase NF1 protein expression, and normalize Ras pathway signaling in NF1 +/- Schwann cells, and by further screening libraries of known drugs for increased NF1 expression, we propose a novel path of NF1 drug discovery that will impact a broad range of NF1 patients and symptoms, in a preventative manner, and without regard to the wide spectrum of NF1 genetic mutations. Research Background. Increasing NF1 expression via transfection reverses abnormal Ras activation resulting from NF1 loss (Wallis, et al. 2018). Transcriptional activation in other genetic conditions such as Willams-Beuren Syndrome, and Supravalvular Aortic Stenosis compensates for haploinsufficiency (Giordano, et al. 2012). Lastly, overcoming haploinsufficiency in another autosomal dominant condition (Sim1 induced obesity; mouse model) was recently shown using a Crispr/dCas9 transcriptional activator (Ahituv, et al. 2019). Specific Aims. 1) Construct a luciferase reporter assay engineered into the endogenous NF1 gene of a well characterized, publically available, immortalized NF1 +/- Schwann cell line (Wallace et al. 2016; data published at Synapse.org). Validate assay using a viral transcription factor developed by Infixion using Crispr/dCas9 to upregulate NF1. 2) Deploy this NF1 luciferase reporter assay to screen 50+ known drugs shown by Infixion to correlate with increased NF1 expression across various cell/tissue types. Next, use this validated luciferase reporter to screen a 13,000+ compound repurposing library of known drugs available from Scripps Research Institute (known as ReFrame). 3) The top hits from Aim 2 screens will be evaluated, utilizing both immortalized and iPSC derived NF1+/- Schwann cells, for the following: a) ability to induce NF1 mRNA and protein expression, using qPCR and Westerns, b) the impact on Ras signaling (pERK, ELK-1, AKT, etc.) utilizing a targeted quantitative mass spec proteomics assay, c) their broader impact on gene expression in Schwann cells utilizing RNAseq, d) impact on cell proliferation, and e) their safety profile based on published data from previous trials. The goal is to prioritize not more than 3-5 candidates to take forward into a Phase 2 evaluation. Project Narrative Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that impacts an estimated 1 in 3000 people worldwide, and one that is characterized by a complex set of symptoms shown to be dependent on haploinsufficiency (i.e., the lack of normal protein). By upregulating NF1 protein expression from the normal allele by two-fold, and thus restoring normal levels of functional NF1 protein in tissues important in NF1, we target a range of NF1 symptoms by eliminating the haploinsufficient environment. We propose to develop and utilize NF1-specific luciferase reporter and proteomic assays, along with standard small molecule evaluation tools, to characterize a small molecule library of repurposed drugs for their ability to upregulate NF1 transcription, and to further evaluate the resulting impact of “hits” on NF1 protein expression, cell proliferation, gene expression specificity, as well as downstream pathways (such as Ras, MEK, mTOR) known to be dysregulated by mutations in the NF1 gene.",Increasing NF1 Expression as a Treatment for NF1 Haploinsufficiency,10145101,R43NS117234,"['Alleles

"Reproducible, Unbiased Ligand Identification Assisted by Artificial Intelligence and Development of Ligand Reference Libraries Our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms of disease and structure-based design of drugs for treatment, rely on experimentally determined 3D structures of proteins and other macromolecules complexed with small molecule ligands. Many of these structures have direct relevance to public health, especially complexes of drug targets with drugs, inhibitors, substrates, or allosteric effectors. Yet, structure-based drug discovery is severely complicated and hindered by experimental bias and the shortcomings of current methods of experimental ligand identification, which often result in misidentified, missing, or misplaced ligands. The propagation of erroneous structures combined with an increased accessibility to structural data not only thwarts reproducibility in biomedical research and drug discovery, but also diverts valuable resources down doomed research avenues. We will leverage our extensive experience validating and refining ligand binding sites to generate ligand reference libraries that will be made publically available on a new web resource dedicated to the interaction of small molecules and macromolecules. These libraries can be used in many downstream applications, such as drug design, computational chemistry, biology, and bioinformatics. We will utilize recent technological advances in machine learning in conjunction with existing tools to create a standardized protocol for density interpretation and unbiased, reproducible ligand identification. This pipeline will not only be able identify and model ligands in unassigned density fragments, but also be able to detect and correct suboptimally refined ligands in existing structures. As the proposed AI will be free from cognitive bias, it should alleviate the most severe problems in structure-based drug design. Because improperly interpreted structures can have a significant deleterious ripple effect, we will experimentally verify select biomedically important structures with dubious experimental support for critical small molecules using use X-ray crystallography or electron microscopy. This proposal addresses current shortcomings of ligand identification in experimentally determined structures through a combination of novel machine learning algorithms and existing validation mechanisms. The main deliverables are 1) curated libraries of validated ligand binding sites and the tools used to produce the libraries and 2) a machine learning assisted pipeline for the interpretation of density fragments corresponding to small molecules within macromolecular structures. Some biologically important ligand binding sites with ambiguous, incomplete, or no experimental data will be experimentally verified using X-ray crystallography or electron microscopy.","Reproducible, Unbiased Ligand Identification Assisted by Artificial Intelligence and Development of Ligand Reference Libraries",10200091,R01GM132595,"['Algorithms ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Crystallization ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug Design ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Ions ', ' Libraries ', ' Ligands ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Electron Microscopy ', ' Structural Models ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' Molecular Structure ', ' Macromolecular Structure ', ' Peptides ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Standardization ', ' Teaching Materials ', ' teacher materials ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' X-Ray Radiation ', ' X-ray ', ' Xray ', ' Generations ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' base ', ' density ', ' macromolecule ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' X-Ray Crystallography ', ' Single Crystal Diffraction ', ' X Ray Crystallographies ', ' X-Ray Diffraction Crystallography ', ' X-Ray/Neutron Crystallography ', ' Xray Crystallography ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Intuition ', ' Descriptor ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' electron density ', ' experience ', ' Cryo-electron Microscopy ', ' Electron Cryomicroscopy ', ' cryo-EM ', ' cryoEM ', ' Cryoelectron Microscopy ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Modeling ', ' computational chemistry ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' drug discovery ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Nucleic Acid Binding ', ' Effectiveness ', ' small molecule ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Stratification ', ' Cognitive ', ' Ligand Binding ', ' Ontology ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Docking ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' 3-D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3D structure ', ' stem ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' Structural Protein ', ' online resource ', ' internet resource ', ' on-line compendium ', ' on-line resource ', ' online compendium ', ' web resource ', ' web-based resource ', ' FAIR principles ', ' FAIR data ', ' FAIR guiding principles ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2021,561173,VA-05
"Genome-wide structure-based analysis of protein-protein interactions and networks Project Summary  Our lab works in the general area of computational structural biology although it also includes an experimental component. We carry out theoretical and computational research and develop software tools, with our efforts being guided by a variety of applications of biomedical importance. In the past we have elucidated the structural and energetic origins of protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions, developed methods for protein structure prediction, and detected novel structural and functional relationships between proteins based on their geometric similarity. We currently focus on two distinct areas: the exploitation of structural information to predict protein function on a genome-wide scale and the molecular basis of cell-cell recognition. The former topic is the subject of the current proposal which focuses on the prediction of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and protein interaction networks. Our overarching goal is to provide a structure-informed perspective in multiple areas of systems biology, thus filling a major gap in this rapidly growing area of biomedical research.  Our research plans are derived from our development of the PrePPI algorithm and corresponding database of human PPIs. PrePPI provides proteome-wide structure-based predictions of PPIs, and discovers relationships not obtainable from other methods. The P-HIPSTer algorithm, which is derived from PrePPI, offers analogous information for virus-human PPIs for 1000 human-infecting viruses. The reliability of both resources has been validated experimentally, and both have revealed novel biological insights. PrePPI, in common with other PPI databases, is cell-context independent and, for example, does not distinguish among tissue and tumor types. To address this challenge, we developed the OncoSig algorithm that uses machine learning methods to combine PrePPI with regulatory interactions from patient genomic data. The generation of tumor-specific lists of PPIs, called SigSets, can then be mapped onto a context-dependent PPI network, or SigMap. We have also developed novel methodologies that link protein structure space with chemical compound space.  The current proposal builds on these accomplishments with new methodological developments and new applications to network biology. We plan to integrate PrePPI with PPI information derived from genetic interactions derived from the correlation of gene profiles across many conditions (e.g. tumor types, cell lines or drug treatments). This will provide an unprecedented structure- and context-dependent view of protein interaction networks. Other plans include the extension of PrePPI to non-human genomes and the extension of P-HIPSTer to bacterial pathogens. Our overall vision includes the development of an integrated set of software tools and databases that will advance cutting edge biomedical applications. These tools will range in scope from protein- protein interaction networks, structure-derived protein function annotation and to the linking of network biology to chemical compound space which will suggest druggable targets within networks and provide leads for small molecules that can target individual proteins. Project Narrative This project focuses on the modeling and incorporation of protein three-dimensional structures across the human proteome to further our ability to describe disease-related protein-protein interaction networks in tissue- and tumor-specific contexts. These structure-informed networks will reveal mechanistic insights regarding cellular processes underlying human diseases ranging from cancer to those resulting from viral and bacterial infection. Our results will also provide hypotheses regarding drugs that can target proteins in these networks.",Genome-wide structure-based analysis of protein-protein interactions and networks,10086553,R35GM139585,"['Algorithms ', ' Bacterial Infections ', ' bacteria infection ', ' bacterial disease ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Nucleic Acids ', ' Patients ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' viral infection ', ' virus infection ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' Virus ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' link protein ', ' cartilage link protein ', ' Generations ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' structural biology ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Proteome ', ' Modeling ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' small molecule ', ' Address ', ' Systems Biology ', ' protein structures ', ' proteins structure ', ' protein structure ', ' Protein Analysis ', ' Molecular ', ' protein function ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' protein structure prediction ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' 3-D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3D structure ', ' pathogenic bacteria ', ' bacteria pathogen ', ' bacterial pathogen ', ' human disease ', ' tumor ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' druggable target ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R35,2021,405000,NY-13

"A precision medicine approach to improve prediction of severe toxicity in fluorouracil chemotherapy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT My long-term goal is to improve the toxicity profiles for cancer therapeutics. One-third of cancer patients treated with the commonly prescribed chemotherapeutic 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) experience severe and life- threatening toxicity to standard doses of the drug. An appreciable fraction of those patients die—not due to cancer, but because of side-effects related to treatment. Clinical studies indicate that the majority of patients who experience severe toxicity to 5-FU are deficient for an enzyme called dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD, DPYD gene); however, only four genetic variants in DPYD have been adequately characterized to be considered predictive of 5-FU toxicity in clinical studies. My preliminary studies demonstrate that these four variants explain only a small fraction of severe 5-FU toxicities and have exceedingly limited clinical value outside of individuals with European ancestry. The primary objective of the studies proposed in this grant application is to identify additional biomarkers of 5-FU toxicity risk that can be used to individualize 5-FU dosing with the goal of improving the safety profile for the drug. My overall hypothesis is that expanded biomarker-based pre-treatment tests will more accurately identify patients with DPD deficiency, as well as the relative degree to which the DPD function is impaired, enabling more accurate dose optimization. My rationale is that improved biomarker-based approaches to dose individualization have strong potential to improve the safety profile for this commonly used therapeutic. Aim #1 will identify risk alleles for severe 5-FU–related toxicity in understudied populations. Aim #2 will characterize multi-marker haplotype contributions to 5-FU toxicity. In Aim #3, I will develop an integrated predictive model of 5-FU toxicity using deep machine learning. It is my expectation that the proposed studies, which will leverage multiple large patient and volunteer data and specimen collections to address various aspects of my primary hypothesis, will answer key questions that have vexed pharmacogenetics researchers for decades. In doing so, the proposed studies are expected to identify clinically relevant biomarkers that can be used to improve the safety profile of 5-FU through dose optimization. PROJECT NARRATIVE Improved predictive tests for 5-FU toxicity risk, coupled with a clear indication of the clinical validity of such tests, is relevant to public health because it is expected to reduce the number and severity of adverse drug reactions, improve treatment efficacy, and lower the overall financial burden for cancers treated with 5-FU. Collectively, this is expected to optimize longer-term systemic therapy and minimize toxicity with an overall improvement in quality of life for cancer patients.",A precision medicine approach to improve prediction of severe toxicity in fluorouracil chemotherapy,10295231,R01CA251065,"['Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Breast ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Data Collection ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Fluorouracil ', ' 5-FU ', ' 5-Fluracil ', ' 5FU ', ' Fluoro Uracil ', ' Fluoruracil ', ' Fluouracil ', ' Goals ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Incidence ', ' Masks ', ' Medicine ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacogenetics ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Western Europe ', ' Work ', ' Dihydropyrimidine Dehydrogenase ', ' Dihydrothymine Dehydrogenase (NADP) ', ' African American ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Severities ', ' Reaction ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Therapeutic Uses ', ' DPYD gene ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Systemic Therapy ', ' SYS-TX ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Collection ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' Impairment ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' chemotherapy ', ' volunteer ', ' high risk ', ' candidate marker ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' risk variant ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk allele ', ' risk gene ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk loci ', ' risk locus ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' under representation of groups ', ' under represented groups ', ' under represented populations ', ' underrepresentation of groups ', ' predictive test ', ' predictive assay ', ' multidimensional data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' side effect ', ' adverse drug reaction ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' financial burden ', ' financial distress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial stress ', ' medication safety ', ' drug safety ', ' pharmaceutical safety ', ' dose individualization ', ' ']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2021,363713,MN-01
"Computer Simulations of Enzymes Computer simulations using molecular dynamics (MD) and the combined quantum  mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) approach are capable of describing structures and dynamics  of proteins and chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes. An accurate and  computationally efficient energy function is necessary. However, challenges remain: the  accuracy of QM method, the compatibility between the electron density of the QM subsystem and  classical force fields for the MM subsystem, and the cost of ab initio QM/MM methods capitalizing  on the accuracy and reliability of the associated QM approaches. To address these challenges, we  have developed a series of ab initio QM/MM approaches on reaction path optimizations and free  energy calculations, the QM/MM minimum free-energy path (QM/MM-MFEP) and the QM/MM neural  network (QM/MM-NN) methods. This proposal aims to develop further the ab initio QM/MM methodology  and its applications to the studies of redox processes in important enzymes, and the construction  of ab initio force fields combined with neural network representations. Our long-term goals are to develop and establish accurate first-principles based and density  functional theory (DFT) based MD and QM/MM simulation as an equal partner with experiments for the  study of enzymes and proteins and to provide insight into chemical and redox processes in  biological systems. Our aims are as follows: (1) We aim to make ab initio QM/MM models for much  more accurate QM/MM energies, for the QM description and for the electrostatic and vdW interactions   between the QM and MM subsystems. (2) We aim to develop a combined computational  model to explore the key molecular determinants of the reduction potential variability in  metalloproteins. We will provide detailed insight into chemical and redox reaction mechanisms in  biological systems, in particular laccases. (3) We aim at the development of accurate  force fields of water, and proteins for simulations in biological applications, going beyond the  traditional force field forms and limitation in accuracy. The proposed developments will capitalize on the theoretical developments in quantum  electronic theory, such as the linear response theory and accurate many-electron approach for  non-covalent interactions, and leverage machine-learning methods in data science for biological  system simulations. The proposed work will lead to the major advancement of the ab initio QM/MM  method and force fields, and insights into the structure-function paradigm for proteins  and important redox process and reaction mechanisms in enzymes. In addition, it will also lead to  methodology development for design of new drugs and enzyme inhibitors. Understanding chemical reactions and redox processes in solution and in enzymes is of critical  importance, because the structure-function relationship and the catalytic role of enzymes  are fundamental insights in biochemical research, and they are essential for the development of  new or better inhibitors and enzymes. Quantitative tools such as simulations make key contributions  to the investigation of the structure-function relationship, complementing experimental studies.  This proposal aims at developing methods for simulating structures and dynamics in proteins, and  chemical and redox processes catalyzed by enzymes, and investigating the mechanisms of  important enzymes-copper protein laccases, leading to significant advances in research tools for  studying enzymes and contributing to the understanding of life processes, as well as aiding in the  design of inhibitors and drugs.",Computer Simulations of Enzymes,10246502,R01GM061870,"['conformational state ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Oxidation-Reduction ', ' Redox ', ' oxidation reduction reaction ', ' Protein Engineering ', ' genetic protein engineering ', ' protein design ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Structure-Activity Relationship ', ' chemical structure function ', ' structure function relationship ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Work ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' X-Ray Radiation ', ' X-ray ', ' Xray ', ' Laccase ', ' Urishiol Oxidase ', ' p-Diphenol Oxidase ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Series ', ' Chemicals ', ' insight ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Electrostatics ', ' Life ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Reaction ', ' chemical reaction ', ' electron density ', ' intermolecular interaction ', ' Molecular Dynamics Simulation ', ' molecular dynamics ', ' Performance ', ' Potential Energy ', ' Free Energy ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' molecular mechanics ', ' Enzyme Antagonist ', ' Enzyme Inhibitor ', ' Enzyme Inhibitor Agent ', ' Enzyme Inhibitor Drugs ', ' Address ', ' Biochemical Process ', ' biophysical mechanism ', ' Biophysical Process ', ' Protein Dynamics ', ' Scheme ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' quantum ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' biological systems ', ' perturbation theory ', ' Data Science ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' neural network ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Chemistry ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' computational simulation ', ' computerized simulation ', ' Copper ', ' Cu element ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electrons ', ' Negative Beta Particle ', ' Negatrons ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Goals ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Metalloproteins ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' ']",NIGMS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,360392,NC-04
"High Throughput Screen and High Information Follow-Up Tests for Genotoxicants Project Summary  Current batteries of genetic toxicology assays exhibit several critical deficiencies. First, the throughput capacity of in vitro genotoxicity tests is low, and does not meet current needs, especially for early, high volume screening environments that need to prioritize chemicals for further testing and/or development. Second, conventional assays provide simplistic binary calls, genotoxic or non-genotoxic. In this scheme there is little or no information provided about genotoxic mode of action. This is severely limiting, as it does not generate key information necessary for prioritizing chemicals for further testing, guiding subsequent assays’ endpoints/experimental designs, or conducting risk assessments. Finally, most current assays do not place requisite emphasis on dose response relationships, and therefore do not contextualize the results in terms of potency. These deficiencies prevent genotoxicity data from optimally contributing to modern risk assessments, where all of these capabilities and high information content are essential. We will solve these issues by developing, optimizing, and validating a two-tiered testing strategy based on multiplexed DNA damage responsive biomarkers and high-speed flow cytometric analysis. The first-tier focuses on throughput and is used to prioritize likely genotoxicants for more comprehensive analysis in second tier testing. Specifically, it involves a collection of several multiplexed biomarkers that will be used to identify likely genotoxic agents and provide a preliminary assessment of genotoxic mode of action. The gH2AX biomarker detects DNA double strand breaks, phospho-histone H3 identifies mitotic cells, nuclear p53 content reports on p53 activation in response to DNA damage, the frequency of 8n+ cells measure polyploidization, and the ratio of nuclei to microsphere counts provides information about treatment-related cytotoxicity. The second tier focuses on information content and considers many more concentrations as well as additional biomarkers, including micronucleus formation. Collectively, the tier two results provide definitive predictions about test chemicals’ genotoxic potential, mode of action, and potency. Over the course of this project we will study more than 3,000 diverse chemicals in order to understand the performance characteristics and generalizability of the two-tiered testing strategy. An interlaboratory trial will be conducted with prototype assay kits to assess the transferability of the methods, with the ultimate goal of providing the Nation with commercially available kits and testing services. Project Narrative Some chemicals in commercial use and in the environment can cause DNA damage and this damage can contribute to the development of cancer and other severe diseases. We will develop, optimize, and validate an improved testing strategy based on highly automated processes tracking several DNA damage biomarkers that can be analyzed without the need for animal testing.

"Spatiotemporal control of concentration gradients with electrochemistry in extracelluar space Project Summary  The natural environment is intrinsically spatiotemporally heterogenous at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. What shapes such a heterogeneity includes the concentration gradients of biologically relevant chemical species in the extracellular medium including dioxygen (O2), reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as essential redox-active transition metals. While a significant amount of effort has been devoted to spectroscopically image these chemical moieties, our capability to spatiotemporally control their concentration distributions in the extracellular medium remains limited. This is especially the case for biofilms and microbiota, in which the microorganisms’ small length scales pose significant challenges for concentration modulation. The inadequate control of concentration heterogeneity limits our capability of mimicking the natural environments in vitro and investigating how local concentration gradients affect microbial functionality. Therefore, there is a need for an advanced method of controlling chemical concentrations at microscopic level.  Our proposed research aims to use electrochemical nano-/micro-electrodes to spatiotemporally control the concentration gradients in the extracellular medium. When an electrochemical reaction occurs on an electrode’s surface, a concentration gradient is established near the electrode. Taking advantages of this phenomena with the assistance of numerical simulation, we will employ an array of nano-/micro-electrodes with individually addressable electrochemical potentials to program any arbitrary spatiotemporal concentration profiles. We will fine-tune the surface chemistry and the electrochemical properties of these electrodes to ensure biocompatibility and reaction specificity. The developed system will be applied to biofilms and we aim to investigate how the microbial social behavior will be affected by a perturbation of local O2 concentration. Moreover, we will use this device to mimic the heterogenous environment in the gut and culture gut microbiota in vitro. An algorithm based on machine learning will be employed to actively adjust electrode potentials, maintaining a stable concentration profile despite the accumulation of gut microorganisms.  Ultimately, our work will expand our capability of controlling the concentration heterogeneity in nature. The developed electrochemical system will serve an in vitro platform to culture microorganisms in their native environment, or as a tool to perturb the concentration profiles. Combining electrochemistry, inorganic chemistry, and nanomaterials the research will enable a deeper understanding of the spatial distribution and temporal response of microbial systems. Project Narrative The natural environment is intrinsically heterogenous yet our control of concentrations for chemical species is limited at microscopic level. The proposed research is relevant to the mission of the NIH because it describes the development of technology that will expand our capability of controlling chemical concentration profiles in a variety of microbial systems relevant to the public health.

"Groundwork for a Synchrotron MicroCT Imaging Resource for Biology (SMIRB) Project Summary Each major human disease is associated with a specific range of morphological changes to cells and tissues in the micron scale. Normal and abnormal structure was discovered and is still characterized using histology - a microscopic technique that depends on physical tissue slices. Presently, histology’s use in systems biology is limited by its largely descriptive and two-dimensional nature. Making histology quantitative and three-dimensional would be potentially transformational for research and diagnostics, but has been impractical. Accordingly, we have now created a 3D form of histology by customizing X-ray microtomography (micro-CT) of fixed and stained, millimeter-scale, whole organisms and tissue samples. We used fixed and metal-stained, whole zebrafish because they contain a full range of tissues within the size range currently studied histologically. The result is the first practical way to create virtual histology-like “sections” in any plane. Three-dimensional, complete histological phenotyping has potential use in genetic and chemical screens, and in clinical and toxicological tissue diagnostics. Here, we propose the next steps needed to enable high-throughput, quantitative, 3D histological phenotyping of whole, millimeter-scale animals. The proposed work applies the principles of chemistry, physics, and computer science to improve image resolution, throughput, and analytics, organized into three specific aims. Specific Aim 1 will build on our developments in this project and further improve imaging volume and resolution by upgrading imaging array, optics, and sub-pixel shifting, and to throughput by changes in sample embedding, loading geometry and mechanics, helical CT scanning, scintillator material, and to data sharing by improvements to the ViewTool infrastructure and user interface. Specific Aim 2 will yield reference images to define the range of normal phenotypic variation and to obtain samples related to a range of potential applications. Specific Aim 3 will apply the power of machine learning to segmentation, annotation, and analytics. Together, this work will establish a practical foundation for large-scale genetic and chemical screens involving mm-scale, whole organisms based on 3-dimensional, quantitative, histological phenotyping. The instrumentation and analytics will be state-of-the-art in its combination of resolution, field-of-view, pancellularity, image quality, analytical potential, throughput, sample stability, and reproducibility and largely usable with both tube and synchrotron X-ray sources. The voxel resolution will be at least 0.5 μm across fields-of-view of up to 1 cm. Representation of every cell type make the images suitable for cross-referencing across imaging modalities. Potential applications will be explored, “wild-type” will begin to be defined, and training sets for automated segmentation generated. The potential impact will encompass the missions of most NIH Institutes and Centers. The whole-animal genetic and chemical screens enabled are expected to impact drug development, diagnostics, and our basic understanding of how genes and environment define phenotype. Project Narrative Our group has established the only three-dimensional form of histology that is suitable for histopathology and quantitative tissue phenotyping, tissue X-ray microtomography (micro-CT). We outline here a plan to establish mechanisms for increasing resolution and field-of-view, to add sample multiplexing, to simply sample preparation, and to explore machine learning mechanisms for defining normal and abnormal structure towards whole-organism complete tissue phenotyping. The resulting tools will allow the community to comprehensively and computationally determine the roles of genes and environment in defining phenotype, which has implications in drug development, biomedical research, and medicine.",Groundwork for a Synchrotron MicroCT Imaging Resource for Biology (SMIRB),10222804,R24OD018559,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Animals ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' bone ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cesium ', ' Cs element ', ' Chemistry ', ' Communities ', ' Drosophila genus ', ' Drosophila ', ' fruit fly ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Environment ', ' Fishes ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Histology ', ' Institutes ', ' instrumentation ', ' Iodides ', ' Medicine ', ' Metals ', ' Mission ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nerve ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physics ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Robotics ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Siblings ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Stains ', ' Staining method ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' Travel ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' X-Ray Radiation ', ' X-ray ', ' Xray ', ' Zebrafish ', ' Brachydanio rerio ', ' Danio rerio ', ' Zebra Danio ', ' Zebra Fish ', ' Measures ', ' Normal Range ', ' Normal Values ', ' Custom ', ' Caenorhabditis elegans ', ' C elegans ', ' C. elegans ', ' C.elegans ', ' Synchrotrons ', ' Tube ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' detector ', ' improved ', ' Body measure procedure ', ' Body Measures ', ' Microscopic ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Series ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Cellular Structures ', ' Cell Components ', ' Cell Structure ', ' Genetic ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' millimeter ', ' Scanning ', ' Source ', ' cell type ', ' Texture ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' mutant ', ' computer science ', ' Histopathology ', ' Structure ', ' Helical CT ', ' Helical Computed Tomography ', ' Spiral Acquisition CT ', ' Spiral CT ', ' Spiral Volumetric CT ', ' Spiral Volumetric Computed Tomography ', ' spiral CT scan ', ' Spiral Computed Tomography ', ' Sampling ', ' drug development ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Animal Genetics ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Slice ', ' Whole Organism ', ' Preparation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' disease phenotype ', ' virtual ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' two-dimensional ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' human disease ', ' clinical toxicology ', ' data sharing ', ' Geometry ', ' Structural defect ', ' Structural malformation ', ' structural abnormalities ', ' structural anomalies ', ' microCT ', ' X-ray microtomography ', ' Xray microtomography ', ' micro CT ', ' micro computed tomography ', ' microtomography ', ' crowdsourcing ', ' crowd source ', ' crowd-sourcing ', ' crowdsource ', ' Tissue imaging ', ' histological studies ', ' histologic studies ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' Infrastructure ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' feature detection ', ' feature recognition ', ' data dissemination ', ' automated segmentation ', ' auto-segmentation ', ' automatic segmentation ', ' autosegmentation ', ' ']",OD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R24,2021,657323,PA-10
"Discovering Chemical Activity Networks-Predicting Bioactivity Based on Structure PROJECT SUMMARY NIEHS has established Predictive Toxicology as a strategic goal for advancing environmental health sciences. The overarching goal of this RIVER proposal is to predict animal toxicity of chemicals based on their structure. My team and I will expose millions of zebrafish embryos to a library of 10,000 synthetic chemicals across wide concentration ranges. If a chemical shows signs of bioactivity, we will systematically analyze whole animal gene expression changes before the phenotype appears. We will formulate hypotheses about which biomolecular targets the chemicals attacked initially and which pathways led to the observed endpoint. To test those hypotheses, we will edit the zebrafish genome via CRISPR/Cas9 to knock out or over-express critical genes, to discover the ones causally related to the chemical phenotypes. These studies will be highly relevant to human health. Zebrafish possess fully integrated vertebrate organ systems that perform the same functions as their human counterparts and demonstrate well-conserved physiology. Eighty-four percent of the genes that participate in human disease also exist in zebrafish. Zebrafish studies provide a fast, inexpensive way to screen a large volume of chemicals, generate rich hypotheses for drug development, and prioritize candidates for toxicity studies with mammals and human cell cultures. We will compare our results with those of human cell culture studies to clarify the strengths and weaknesses of each method and to reduce the uncertainty associated with applying zebrafish results to human biology. We will post our experimental results in a public database that explains which of the 10,000 Tox21 chemicals are bioactive, which initial targets they strike, and which pathways lead to which endpoints in embryonic and juvenile zebrafish. This information will enable green chemists to detoxify products by substituting a biologically inactive molecule. It will help toxicologists and risk assessors to prioritize chemicals for expensive experiments with rodents and human cell cultures. It will give pharmaceutical scientists thousands of new data points upon which to develop hypotheses about how to modulate a given gene target or activate a given pathway. We will use machine-learning-based chemoinformatic approaches to analyze our zebrafish data and infer the relationship between the structure of a chemical and its biological activity. Our rich data about chemical activity networks will advance the scientific community’s understanding of linkages between chemical exposure and phenotypes. Our work will enable scientists to predict whether a chemical will be biologically active, what target it will act upon, and what networks it will perturb, solely on the basis of its structure. It will enable scientists to reduce, refine, and replace experiments with animals, including zebrafish, and to predict chemical activity networks with computers. NARRATIVE We encounter a wide diversity of chemicals throughout our lives, but we are not yet equipped to understand which of these chemicals actually pose health risks. Furthermore, for the chemicals known to produce human disease, we do not fully understand how they lead to adverse outcomes.

However, effective, safe, and effective delivery remains a significant challenge for therapeutic translation and for application to cell types that are difficult to culture ex vivo. Ideally, intact Cas9 protein would be delivered with its guide RNA (sgRNA) as a purified ribonucleoprotein (RNP), as opposed to Cas9-encoding mRNA or plasmids, to minimize off-target effects. Viral vectors (e.g., AAVs) cannot deliver such large cargo due to their limited capsid size, which exhibit additional challenges with respect to immunogenicity, cost, and manufacturability. Fortunately, synthetic polymers--widely studied in the context of nucleic acid delivery and as biomaterials--have recently shown promise as vehicles for in vivo delivery of sgRNA- Cas9 RNPs. However, there are no consistent design principles by which novel synthetic polymers with improved delivery efficiency, tissue specificity, and safety can be developed. There are far too many polymer structures to test exhaustively or through ad hoc experimentation, so a systematic approach to polymer design, synthesis, and evaluation is required to identify promising candidates. This proposal presents a framework for the discovery of functional polymers through Bayesian experimental design. Machine learning models trained on experimental outcomes will serve as surrogates for experimentation in order to virtually screen a massive library of potential polymer candidates. Polymer candidates will be selected algorithmically through Bayesian Optimization to balance exploration of unknown chemical space and exploitation of structures known to effectively deliver RNPs. Aim 1 will involve (a) the synthesis of a diverse library of biodegradable poly(ester urea amines) (PEUAs), (b) the evaluation of their functional performance using a model fluorescent reporter knock-in/knock-out assay, a cell viability assay, and a metabolic activity assay, and (c) the development and validation of a machine learning model to learn a quantitative relationship between polymer structure/composition and these multiple performance metrics. Aim 2 will involve (a) the enumeration of the chemical space of synthetically accessible PEUAs, and (b) the development and application of a Bayesian Optimization framework leveraging the machine learning model from Aim 1 to guide the selection of candidate polymers from the enumerated space through iterative rounds of experimentation. The outcome of the proposed work will be an integrated tool combining machine learning and polymer science for the unbiased exploration of a broad biomaterial design space, validated through the development of effective and safe RNP delivery vehicles for gene editing that outperform existing commercial polymeric vehicle solutions. NARRATIVE Gene editing is a powerful technology with the potential to cure a wide variety of genetic disorders, but methods for delivering gene editing systems into live cells exhibit significant limitations. The current proposal combines concepts in active learning, machine learning, and polymer science to discover new synthetic polymers with improved delivery performance. Such a platform will lead to safer, cheaper, and more effective delivery of gene therapies and will be broadly applicable to the discovery of polymers for other biomedical applications.","Accelerated discovery of synthetic polymers for ribonucleoprotein delivery through the integration of active learning, machine learning, and polymer science",10195432,R21GM141616,"['Algorithms ', ' Amines ', ' amine ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Biocompatible Materials ', ' Biomaterials ', ' biological material ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Capsid ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Esters ', ' Exhibits ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' gene therapy ', ' DNA Therapy ', ' Gene Transfer Clinical ', ' Genetic Intervention ', ' gene-based therapy ', ' genetic therapy ', ' genomic therapy ', ' Genes ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Lipids ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Plasmids ', ' Polymers ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Ribonucleoproteins ', ' Ribonucleotides ', ' Ribonucleoside Phosphates ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Safety ', ' Science ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translations ', ' Urea ', ' Carbamide ', ' Elaqua XX ', ' Urea Carbamide ', ' Ureaphil ', ' Work ', ' Guide RNA ', ' gRNA ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chemicals ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Active Learning ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Metabolic ', ' Reporter ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' exhaustion ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' biocompatibility ', ' biomaterial compatibility ', ' Lytotoxicity ', ' cytotoxicity ', ' Performance ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' polypeptide ', ' chemical informatics ', ' cheminformatics ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Polymer Chemistry ', ' in vivo ', ' Validation ', ' Viral Vector ', ' Knock-out ', ' Knockout ', ' Gene Delivery ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' immunogenicity ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' manufacturing process ', ' Cell model ', ' Cellular model ', ' candidate selection ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' CRISPR method ', ' CRISPR methodology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR-based method ', ' CRISPR-based technique ', ' CRISPR-based technology ', ' CRISPR-based tool ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 technology ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats method ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats methodology ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats technique ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats technology ', ' Knock-in ', ' knockin ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' genetic condition ', ' genetic disorder ', ' manufacturability ', ' nucleic acid delivery ', ' in silico ', ' virtual screening ', ' virtual screenings ', ' RNA delivery ', ' ']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2021,197622,MA-07
"Development of a metabolomics and machine learning based high-throughput screening platform for data-driven drug discovery Project Summary High-throughput omics technologies allow for measuring various biomolecules comprehensively and over the past decade have become exponentially less expensive. Coupling these emerging technologies with automation approaches and the phenotypic-based drug discovery paradigm allows for data-driven drug discovery (D4). D4 focuses on a complete cellular readout, quantitatively measuring 100s to 100,000s of biomolecules or cellular features, rather than focusing on a single protein, pathway, or physiological trait. The complexity of this data requires computational tools for proper analysis and interpretation. In Phase I of this proposal, we combined the dual strengths of experts in LC-MS/MS based metabolomics (Omix Technologies) with leaders in metabolomics data analysis (Sinopia Biosciences) to develop a metabolomics based high-throughput screening platform. We screened ~250 FDA approved small molecules from a broad range of drug classes on two cell lines. This dataset was compared to a matching dataset from the pioneering project for D4, the Connectivity Map, which is a transcriptomics screening and query platform for drug characterization, discovery, and repositioning. In Phase I, we observed that from both a technical and biological utility standpoint, the metabolomics data provided an orthogonal dataset with signal fidelity, sensitivity, and relevance to compound properties comparable to or exceeding the Connectivity Map. Further, we saw high concordance of plasma metabolite changes in type 2 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis patients with in vitro metabolite changes of related drugs used for those indications. Thus, these results suggest that a metabolomics based high-throughput screening platform is not only viable as a complementary dataset to the Connectivity Map, but that metabolomics data can even play a primary role in drug discovery. In this Phase II proposal, we will focus on profiling chemical and genetic perturbations in vitro to further demonstrate the power of the platform and identify commercial opportunities for treating genetically defined rare diseases. We will expand data generation to ~3300 bioactive compounds across three cell lines. Further, we will profile 50 genetic knockouts on those three cell lines to model in vitro the associated rare diseases. Using Sinopia’s platform, we will select compounds for follow-up evaluation to identify candidates that correct for metabolic dysregulations seen in those rare diseases. Successful in vitro programs will aid in seeding of an early stage discovery pipeline that will be advanced through funding by private investment, patient advocacy groups, and additional federal grants. Project Narrative Data-driven drug discovery provides the potential to accelerate drug development timelines, decrease costs, and ultimately provide better care to patients. Combining Sinopia Bioscience’s and Omix Technologies strengths in high-throughput data generation and analysis, we have built a unique platform focused on understanding the use of metabolomics in drug discovery.

"Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions Abstract The overall goal of my research program is to develop and apply computational tools to facilitate the rational design of modulators of important cellular pathways for therapeutic use. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are central factors in cellular signaling and gene regulation networks. Their misregulation is associated with a variety of diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disease, autoimmune disease, and diabetes. Inevitably, many PPIs are biologically compelling targets for drug discovery. But despite a few notable successes, most PPIs have not been successfully targeted and remain undruggable. The fundamental challenge derives from their intrinsic structural features: the binding surfaces of many PPIs are generally large in area, flat, and dynamic. PPIs are often transient and involve multivalent contacts. Currently, one most promising PPI inhibitor discovery strategy is to use miniature protein domain mimetics (PDMs) to reproduce the key interface contacts utilized by nature. PDMs are advantageous as medium-sized molecules with high surface complementarity and a broader set of contact points than typical small molecules, but are still limited because—by definition—only a portion of the total PPI binding energy is captured in the interaction. The binding affinity of the synthetic domains is often lower than the cognate full-length proteins. On the other hand, targeted covalent inhibition is an orthogonal therapeutic approach fit to overcome the fundamental binding limitations at PPIs, but has a well-known drawback: the high reactivity of typical covalent warheads leads to nonspecific inhibition, and toxicity. Here we aim to develop computational methods for a new design strategy that will leverage the strengths of these two methods—PDMs and covalent inhibition—while simultaneously mitigating their respective limitations. The focus of the effort is to rationally discover potent inhibitors that will non-covalently recognize and then covalently target protein-protein binding interfaces with exquisite specificity. Furthermore, our development of robust scoring functions by integrating multitask machine learning and molecular modeling would significantly accelerate the rational drug discovery process. The planned work builds on our recent advances in three state-of-the-art computational approaches: AlphaSpace for fragment- centric topographical mapping of PPI interfaces; ab initio QM/MM molecular dynamics for modeling covalent inhibition; and a novel delta-machine learning strategy to simultaneously improve scoring, docking and screening performance of a protein-ligand scoring function. Our design efforts will result in highly specific and potent modulators of a variety of therapeutically important but previously undruggable PPI interfaces, providing new leads for drug development. Project Narrative Our computational methodology development work will lead to powerful computational tools for rational design of covalent and non-covalent inhibitors, which would significantly accelerate the drug discovery process. Our computational modulator design would result in highly specific and potent inhibitors of a variety of therapeutic targets, which can be used as tools for studying cell signaling and gene regulation, and as new leads for drug development.",Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions,10152659,R35GM127040,"['inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune condition ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Goals ', ' Ligands ', ' Methods ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Work ', ' Tertiary Protein Structure ', ' Peptide Domain ', ' Protein Domains ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Biological ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Protein Binding ', ' bound protein ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' Molecular Dynamics Simulation ', ' molecular dynamics ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Molecular Modeling Nucleic Acid Biochemistry ', ' Molecular Modeling Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Molecular Models ', ' molecular modeling ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' drug development ', ' drug discovery ', ' mimetics ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Therapeutic Uses ', ' small molecule ', ' Length ', ' Affinity ', ' Process ', ' Docking ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' multitask ', ' multi-task ', ' therapeutic target ', ' screening ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' ']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,556806,NY-12
"Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation Project Summary DNA and RNA aptamers are a useful class of synthetic affinity reagents. However, their performance can be greatly improved through the site-specific incorporation of chemically modified, ‘non-natural’ nucleotides that provide a greater chemical repertoire to enable superior aptamer affinity and specificity. Because a broad spectrum of chemical functional groups can be incorporated, non-natural aptamers offer the exciting potential for targeting molecules for which the generation of monoclonal antibodies remains difficult, such as small- molecule drugs, metabolites and carbohydrates. Unfortunately, the access to non-natural aptamers is severely limited. This is because the process of generating non-natural aptamers is technically challenging and limited to a few specialized laboratories. The goal of this project is to develop an integrated instrument, the Non-Natural Aptamer Array (N2A2) that eliminates these bottlenecks and enable rapid and facile non-natural aptamer discovery at virtually any research laboratory. The N2A2 will be built on a modified version of a benchtop commercial sequencer (Illumina MiSeq), and will perform every stage of non-natural aptamer discovery— including sequencing, screening and binding measurements—as part of a single work-flow. There are three main innovative aspects of our N2A2 system. First, our approach will entirely eliminate the need for polymerase engineering, and thus allows us to incorporate virtually any chemical functional group through click chemistry. Second, N2A2 will enable us to directly obtain the binding affinity (Kd) of ~10^7 aptamers directly in complex samples (e.g. cell lysate or serum), thereby resulting in aptamers with high-specificity. Finally, we will develop a machine-learning (ML) approach to identify key motifs (“k-mers”) and predict novel sequences with potentially higher affinity and specificity that can be tested using the N2A2 instrument. We believe this powerful combination of massively parallel, sequence-linked binding measurements with ML-based predictions will allow us to explore sequence space that is currently inaccessible to traditional in vitro selection methods, and enable us to discover aptamers with superior performance. The success of this project will produce an integrated instrument that greatly streamlines and accelerates the discovery of non-natural aptamers for a wide range of targets in complex media. The instrument is based on a commercially available sequencer and we will make all software available to the public. In this way, we believe the N2A2 instrument could broadly expand access to robust, high quality, custom affinity reagents for biomedical research and clinical diagnostics. Project Narrative We will develop an integrated instrument that simplifies the discovery of non-natural aptamer reagents for a wide range of molecules that are difficult to target using conventional antibody reagents.

"Open data-driven infrastructure for building biomolecular force fields for predictive biophysics and drug design PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The study of biomolecular interactions and design of new therapeutics requires accurate physical models of the atomistic interactions between small molecules and biological macromolecules. Over the least few decades, molecular mechanics force ﬁelds have demonstrated the potential that physical models hold for quantitative biophysical modeling and predictive molecular design. However, a signiﬁcant technology gap exists in our ability to build force ﬁelds that achieve high accuracy, can be systematically improved in a statistically robust manner, be extended to new areas of chemistry, can model post-translational and covalent modiﬁcations, are able to quantify systematic errors in predictions, and can be broadly applied across a high-performance software packages. In this project, we aim to bridge this technology gap to enable new generations of accurate quantitative biomolec- ular modeling and (bio)molecular design for chemical biology and drug discovery. In Aim 1, we will produce a modern, open infrastructure to enable practitioners to rapidly and conveniently construct and employ accurate and statistically robust physical force ﬁelds via automated machine learning methods. In Aim 2, we will construct open, machine-readable experimental and quantum chemical datasets that will accelerate next-generation force ﬁeld development. In Aim 3, we will develop statistically robust Bayesian inference techniques to enable the auto- mated construction of type assignment schemes that avoid overﬁtting and selection of physical functional forms statistically justﬁed by the data. This approach will also provide an estimate of the systematic error in predicted properties arising from uncertainty in parameters or functional form choices—generally the dominant source of error—to be quantiﬁed with little added expense. In Aim 4, we will integrate and apply this infrastructure to produce open, transferable, self-consistent force ﬁelds that achieve high accuracy and broad coverage for modeling small molecule interactions with biomolecules (including unnatural amino or nucleic acids and covalent modiﬁcations by organic molecules), with the ultimate goal of covering all major biomolecules. This research is signiﬁcant in that the technology developed in this project has the potential to radically transform the study of biomolecular phenomena by providing highly accurate force ﬁelds with exceptionally broad chemical coverage via fully consistent parameterization of organic (bio)molecules. In addition, we will produce new tools to automate force ﬁeld creation and tailoring to speciﬁc problem domains, quantify the systematic error in predictions, and identify new data for improving force ﬁeld accuracy. This will greatly improve our ability to study diverse biophysical processes at the molecular level, and to rationally design new small-molecule, protein, and nucleic acid therapeutics. This approach will bring statistical rigor to the ﬁeld of force ﬁeld construction and application by providing a means to make data-driven decisions, while enhancing reproducibility by enabling it to become a rigorous and reproducible science using a fully open infrastructure and datasets. PROJECT NARRATIVE Scientists use computer simulations of proteins, DNA, and RNA, at atomic detail, to learn how these molecules of life do their jobs. They also use simulations to help design new medications – compounds that can bind and inﬂuence the behavior of these molecules of life, and thereby block diseases at the molecular level.

"Enabling the Accelerated Discovery of Novel Chemical Probes by Integration of Crystallographic, Computational, and Synthetic Chemistry Approaches ABSTRACT Identification of high-quality chemical probes, molecules with high specificity and selectivity against macromolecules, is of critical interest to drug discovery. Although millions of compounds have been screened against thousands of protein targets, small-molecule probes are currently available for only 4% of the human proteome. Thus, more efficient approaches are required to accelerate the development of novel, target-specific probes. In 2019, a new bold initiative called “Target 2035” was launched with the goal of “creating […] chemical probes, and/or functional antibodies for the entire proteome” by 2035. In support of this ambitious initiative, we propose to develop and test a novel integrative AI-driven methodology for rapid chemical probe discovery against any target protein. Here, we will build an integrative workflow where the unique XChem database of experimental crystallographic information describing the pose and nature of chemical fragments binding to the target protein will be used in several innovative computational approaches to predict the structure of organic molecules with high affinity towards specific targets. The candidate molecules will be experimentally validated and then optimized, using computational algorithms, into lead molecules to seed chemical probe development. The proposed project is structured around three following interrelated keystones: (i) Develop a novel method for ligand-binding hot-spot identification and discovery of novel chemical probe candidates; (ii) Develop novel fragment-based integrative computational approach for accelerated de novo design of chemical probes; (iii) Consensus prediction of target-specific ligands, synthesis, and experimental validation of computational hits.  More specifically, we will develop a hybrid method to predict structures of high-affinity ligands for proteins for which XChem fragment screens have been completed. These approaches will be used for screening of ultra- large (>10 billion) chemical libraries to identify putative high affinity ligands within crystallographically determined pockets. Then, we will develop and employ an approach using graph convolutional neural networks for de novo design of a library of strong binders that will be evaluated to select the best candidates for chemical optimization. Finally, we will combine traditional structure-based and novel approaches, developed in this project to select consensus hit compounds against three target proteins: transcription factor brachyury, hydrolase NUDT5, and bromodomain BAZ2B. Iterative design guided by the computational algorithms, synthesis, and testing will progressively optimize molecules to micromolar leads to chemical probes for the target proteins.  Completion of the proposed aims will deliver a robust integrative workflow to identify leads for chemical probes against diverse target proteins.

"Open data-driven infrastructure for building biomolecular force fields for predictive biophysics and drug design PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Current generation molecular simulation models are insufﬁciently accurate, and current generation tools for building those models are limited, not automated, and based on aging infrastructure. Our original R01, “Open Data-driven Infrastructure for Building Biomolecular Force Fields for Predictive Biophysics and Drug Design,” aims to solve these problems, producing a modern infrastructure for building, applying, and improving accurate molecular mechanics force ﬁelds. As part of our NIH-funded project, we have collaborated closely with the Molecular Sciences Software Institute (MolSSI) to use the QCArchive ecosystem to gen- erate and continuously expand very large quantum chemical datasets relevant to biomolecular systems on a variety of supercomputing resources. QCArchive now contains over 42M quantum chemical calculations for over 39M molecules, and has become incredibly popular, with over 1.79M accesses/month. Large quantum chemical datasets relevant to biomolecular systems are incredibly valuable to the AI/ML community. Data is the key element needed for both fundamental research into ML architectures and constructing predictive models for downstream use. Unfortunately, quantum chemical datasets are incredibly expensive to generate, limiting in-house generation of large, useful datasets needed to drive AI/ML research to a few large companies and researchers with access to sufﬁcient computing resources. While AI/ML quantum chemical methods have shown immense promise for biomolecular systems, the limited access to large, curated datasets has greatly hindered researchers from making rapid progress in this area. We aim to bridge this gap by working closely with MolSSI QCArchive developers to address robustness, scal- ability, and data delivery challenges to meet the needs of the biomolecular AI/ML community requiring access to large quantum chemistry datasets (Aim 1). Additional software developers will enable improvements to the QCArchive infrastructure to meet the rapidly growing demands of the AI/ML community. As QCArchive is primarily maintained by a single MolSSI Software Scientist, additional developers are necessary for fully enabling the AI/ML community to take full advantage of the wealth of data generated by our NIH-funded project directly, as well as the data actively being generated by the tools our project has engineered to enable distributed, fault-tolerant quantum chemistry that is rapidly populating QCArchive. We will additionally develop interfaces and dashboards to enable facile discovery, retrieval, and import of quantum chemical datasets within popular machine learning frameworks (Aim 2). To ensure our tools are speciﬁcally useful for the most promising AI/ML applications, we will collaborate directly with AI researchers in the OpenMM, TorchMD, and SchNetPack communities actively developing and deploying quantum machine learning (QML) potentials for biomolecular simulation, with the goal of producing generally useful tools suitable for the wider community yet capable of driving these high-priority applications. PROJECT NARRATIVE Scientists use computer simulations of proteins, DNA, and RNA, at atomic detail, to learn how these molecules of life carry out their functions and to design new medications. This project is designed to improve the models used to perform these simulations, and as a byproduct of this process uses a large amount of supercomputer time to generate valuable quantum chemical data relevant to biomolecular systems. This supplement will make it possible for us to freely and easily share this data with machine learning researchers, enabling anyone to easily access and use this data for building better models of biomolecular systems.",Open data-driven infrastructure for building biomolecular force fields for predictive biophysics and drug design,10412594,R01GM132386,"['Aging ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' computational simulation ', ' computerized simulation ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Drug Design ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Elements ', ' Engineering ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Goals ', ' Industrialization ', ' Institutes ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Science ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Ensure ', ' Chemicals ', ' Ingestion ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' chemical reaction ', ' computational quantum chemistry ', ' quantum chemistry ', ' success ', ' supercomputer ', ' simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' molecular mechanics ', ' drug discovery ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Retrieval ', ' Supercomputing ', ' super computing ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' rapid growth ', ' cluster computing ', ' data grid ', ' datagrid ', ' distributed computing ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' quantum ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' fundamental research ', ' community based participatory research ', ' community led research ', ' community participatory research ', ' community research ', ' participatory action research ', ' data sharing ', ' open data ', ' open science ', ' open-source data ', ' dashboard ', ' TensorFlow ', ' Infrastructure ', ' software infrastructure ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R01,2021,177686,CO-02
"POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS: ULTRASENSITIVE DETECTION, EARLY LIFE EXPOSURES-CLINICAL OUTCOMES (PRETERM BIRTHS, CHRONIC LUNG DISEASE, AND NEUROCOGNITIVE DEFICITS), PREVENTION AND REMEDIATION Project Summary The overarching goal of this project is the development of new and innovative approaches to ultrasensitive detection and identification of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules and their functionalized derivatives (polycyclic aromatic compounds, or PACs). Ms. Mary Bajomo, will pursue research central to these project goals, as outlined by both Specific Aims. The Specific Aims of this Diversity Supplement form a central, essential subset of the work required to achieve the project goals, and provide an essential foundation for the sensing methods to be developed over the course of this project. They also lay the groundwork for bringing Machine Learning methods into the subfield of spectroscopic chemical sensing. Pursuing research at the interface between Chemistry and Machine Learning presents an exceptional training opportunity for Ms. Bajomo, and will allow her to interact strongly with the three PIs and their research groups in three fields: the Halas group, for experimental chemistry in the area of surface-enhanced spectroscopic sensing, the Nordlander group, on nanoparticle-based substrate design, and the Patel group, experts in Machine Learning and Data Science. Our hypothesis is that Machine Learning classifiers can be developed and used to distinguish between specific PAH and PAC molecules found in environmental or biological samples through their vibrational spectroscopic signatures. An essential aspect of this approach is the identification of PAH and PAC molecules while embedded in a molecular or polymer capture layer that has been designed to extract PAH/PAC molecules from environmental and/or biological samples that has its own specific spectroscopic signature “background”. These investigations are foundational to the detection of multicomponent mixtures of PAH/PAC molecules from realistic environmental or biological samples, using a combination of surface- enhanced spectroscopies and Machine Learning algorithms analogous to image recognition in cluttered, complex background environments. The two Specific Aims that Ms Bajomo will pursue are: Specific Aim 1: The identification and quantitative characterization of a universal capture layer for the wide range of PAH and PAC compounds encountered in biological and environmental samples. This capture layer would be serve as a universal coating for surface-enhanced Raman and Infrared spectroscopic substrates, and allow for the extraction of PAH and PAC molecules from solution in concentrations suitable for detection, consistent with concentrations of these chemicals found in samples of interest. Specific Aim 2: To develop surface-enhanced chemical sensing data as input to Machine Learning classifiers, to benchmark their effectiveness in identifying specific PAH molecules and distinguishing PAH/PAC molecules from each other by ML methods. This close synergy between experimental spectroscopic studies and ML classifier testing presents an outstanding opportunity for graduate training at the interface between two extremely important and dynamic research field for Ms. Bajomo.

"West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification Project Summary – Overall West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification (WCMC) The West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification (WCMC) is committed to the overall goals of the NIH Common Fund Metabolomics Initiative and specifically aims to largely improve small molecule identifications. Understanding metabolism is important to gain insight into biochemical processes and relevant to battle diseases such as cancer, obesity and diabetes. Compound identification in metabolomics is still a daunting task with many unknown compounds and false positive identifications. The major goal of the WCMC is therefore to develop processes and resources that accelerate and improve the accuracy of the compound identification workflow for experts and medical professionals. The WCMC for Compound Identification is structured in three different entities: the Administrative Core, the Computational Core and the Experimental Core. The Center is led by the Director Prof. Fiehn in close collaboration with quantum chemistry experts Prof. Wang and Prof. Tantillo, and metabolomics experts Dr. Barupal and Dr. Kind with broad support from mass spectrometry, computational metabolomics and programming experts. The Administrative Core will assist the Computational and Experimental Core to develop and validate large in-silico mass spectral libraries, retention time prediction models and innovative methods for constraining and ranking lists of isomers in an integrated process of cheminformatics tools and databases. The developed tools and databases will be made available to all Common Fund Metabolomics Consortium (CF-MC) members and professional working groups. The WCMC will also provide guidance for compound identification to the National Metabolomics Data Repository. The broad dissemination of developed compound identification protocols, training for compound identification workflows, databases and distribution of internal reference standard kits for metabolomic standardization will overall widely support the metabolomics community.

"Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines Project Abstract  The protection of human health depends on the continued discovery of biologically active compounds and their development into useful pharmaceuticals. Historically, synthetic chemistry has enabled medicinal chemists to create and optimize novel lead compounds and has empowered process chemists to produce compounds at the scale necessary for the treatment of a population. The processes of drug discovery and drug production are undergoing a dramatic change with the development of efficient enzyme catalysts as practical tools for synthesis. Medicinal chemists are now harnessing the promiscuous activities of enzymes to access in a single step medicinally relevant compounds that otherwise require multiple-step chemical syntheses. Further, process chemists are starting to leverage the unrivalled efficiency and inherent sustain- ability of enzymes to replace the expensive catalysts and the toxic reagents and solvents that characterize many current production routes. As a result, enzymes are rapidly becoming important tools for pharmaceu- tical synthesis.  These transformative developments are unfortunately limited by the relative dearth of useful synthetic reactions in the ‘biocatalytic toolbox’. Our group has made fundamental advances to expanding this toolbox by using directed evolution to obtain new, useful biocatalysts starting from enzymes whose activities may have been low or even undetectable for the desired substrate or reaction.  This proposal seeks to expand and generalize a powerful biocatalytic platform for the synthesis of chiral amines. Such compounds are prevalent as building blocks for pharmaceuticals that encompass all realms of human health such as antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer drugs. The ability to improve upon these compounds is dependent on access to suitable building blocks. We have identified the enzyme TrpB as a unique biocatalyst for the synthesis of chiral amines. This enzyme mediates a bond-forming reaction be- tween two substrates, one nucleophilic and one electrophilic. Previous work has almost exclusively focused on the activity of this enzyme with diverse nucleophilic substrates, for which TrpB has modest promiscuity. The research proposed here, by contrast, aims to expand the electrophilic substrate scope of the enzyme to make highly functionalized α-amino acids, as well as other classes of chiral amine such as amino alcohols and β-amino acids. The result of this research will be a new suite of biocatalysts that can be used to syn- thesize a wide range of chiral amine building blocks for the novel medicinal compounds essential for ad- vancing the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases. Project Narrative  The naturally occurring enzyme TrpB will be engineered to synthesize amino acids and chiral amines, which are ubiquitous precursors for bioactive compounds, both natural and synthetic. The results of this pro- ject will allow chemists and biologists direct access to these useful medicinal building blocks using a simple, efficient, and sustainable biocatalytic platform.",Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines,10141255,R01GM125887,"['Acrylates ', ' Aldehyde-Lyases ', ' Aldolases ', ' Amines ', ' amine ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Branched-Chain Amino Acids ', ' branched amino acids ', ' branched chain aminoacid ', ' Amino Alcohols ', ' aminoalcohol ', ' Transaminases ', ' Aminotransferases ', ' Antifungal Agents ', ' Antifungal Drug ', ' Therapeutic Fungicides ', ' anti-fungal ', ' anti-fungal agents ', ' anti-fungal drug ', ' antifungals ', ' Antineoplastic Agents ', ' Anti-Cancer Agents ', ' Antineoplastic Drugs ', ' Antineoplastics ', ' Cancer Drug ', ' Neoplastic Disease Chemotherapeutic Agents ', ' Tumor-Specific Treatment Agents ', ' anti-cancer drug ', ' anticancer agent ', ' anticancer drug ', ' Carbon ', ' chemical synthesis ', ' Dehydration ', ' body water dehydration ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Health ', ' Homoserine ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Indoles ', ' Industry ', ' Production ', ' Propanolamines ', ' Aminopropanols ', ' Protein Engineering ', ' genetic protein engineering ', ' protein design ', ' Pyridoxal Phosphate ', ' Pyridoxal 5-Phosphate ', ' Reagent ', ' Research ', ' Solvents ', ' Threonine ', ' L-Threonine ', ' Tryptophan Synthase ', ' Tryptophan Synthetase ', ' tryptophan desmolase ', ' Tweens ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' serine containing aminolipid ', ' Ser-L ', ' serine-containing lipid ', ' catalyst ', ' base ', ' carboxylate ', ' cofactor ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Active Sites ', ' analog ', ' enzyme activity ', ' Anti-Bacterial Agents ', ' Antibacterial Agents ', ' anti-bacterial ', ' antibacterial ', ' Directed Molecular Evolution ', ' directed evolution ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Reaction ', ' Route ', ' interest ', ' empowered ', ' success ', ' thermolability ', ' thermostability ', ' condensation ', ' Physical condensation ', ' 2-amino-1,3-propanediol ', ' serinol ', ' novel ', ' Property ', ' drug discovery ', ' drug production ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Address ', ' Synthesis Chemistry ', ' Synthetic Chemistry ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' human disease ', ' novel lead compound ', ' ']",NIGMS,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,291940,CA-27
"Using Common Fund datasets for xenobiotic localization Project Summary Subcellular localization, such as the nucleus lysosomes, and mitochondria, has tremendous potential to enhance the effectiveness of the therapeutic molecules rather than random distribution throughout the cell. With improved subcellular localization and enhanced concentration, a specific molecule can be more efficacious as well as less toxic which is usually a concern of random distribution and nonspecific localization. Therefore, understanding subcellular distribution and the mechanism for a specific molecule can further modulate subcellular dysfunction mediated diseases. Xenobiotic localization at the subcellular level has a profound effect on several processes. The overarching goal of the proposed work is to develop a novel platform with computational tools for specific xenobiotic localization. The proposed work will take advantage of three common fund datasets. In specific aim-1, we aim to develop a suite of machine learning (ML) models for hierarchical levels of micro-compartmentation and 40 specific subcellular locations. These machine learning models will be first built using three different types of features (fingerprints-based, pharmacophore-based, and physicochemical descriptors-based). Then, they are fused using an advanced multilayer combinatorial fusion algorithm to get the best consensus model. We will also perform the scaffold analysis to identify critical scaffolds that play a role in accumulating molecules at specific subcellular locations. In specific aim-2, we will conduct experimental validation of the predictions developed ML models. More specifically we will test 50 compounds for their subcellular location. In specific aim-3, we plan to build an open portal that incorporates datasets, ML model, prediction server, and documentation. All the data and models generated from the project are made available as open-source. Project Narrative  We propose to develop a novel platform to predict xenobiotic localization at the subcellular level by leveraging and integrating various Common Fund data sets.

"Next-generation integrated quantum force fields for biomedical applications Next-generation integrated quantum force ﬁelds for biomedical applications PI: Darrin M. York, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ 08854-8087 USA.  We have recently developed novel framework for next-generation quantum mechanical force ﬁelds (QMFFs) designed to meet the challenges of biomolecular simulations and drug discovery applications. QMFFs have tremendous computational advantages relative to their fully QM counterparts, being inherently parallelizable and linearly scaling, offering tremendous computational speedup, and promising quantitative accuracy potentially superior to full QM methods. QMFFs accurately model multipolar electrostatics, charge penetration effects, and non-linear polarization response. QMFFs thus offer a transformative technology for drug discovery applications, in particular, for advancing the predictive capability of free energy simulations in lead reﬁnement. These are critically important for the diverse chemical space of drug molecules, including halogen bonding, cation-  and metal-ligand interactions. Further, QMFFs offer a mechanism for modeling covalent inhibitors. Speciﬁcally, we propose to: I. Develop new QMFFs for drug discovery. QMFFs will be developed based on both semiempirical and ab initio density-functional methods in the following stages: 1) determination of multipolar mapping parameters enhancing the DFTB electrostatic potential to reach greater accuracy, 2) augmentation of electronic response terms using chemical potential equalization (CPE) corrections using an orthogonal perturbation-response approach to solve the under-polarization problem of DFTB methods, 3) parameterization of non-electrostatic non-bonded interac- tion parameters using realistic potentials that capture many-body exchange and dispersion interactions, and 4) exploration of statistical potentials, using machine learning approaches applied to quantum data sets, to correct internal conformational energies and short-range interactions. II. Develop new free energy methods to enable protein-ligand binding predictions using QMFFs. We will develop a novel integrated free energy pipeline to pre- dict alchemical binding free energies for ligands and inhibitors. This will include new GPU-accelerated methods for  -space self-adaptive mixture sampling ( -SAMS) and 2D-vFEP analysis, coupled with conformational space enhanced sampling methods for alchemical steps of the thermodynamic cycle, and advancements in free en- ergy “book-ending” methods (BBQm) to efﬁciently connect molecular mechanical force ﬁeld and QMFF model representations. III. Test and validate QMFFs and free energy methods, and apply to MIF inhibitor binding. The methods will be broadly tested against established data sets for solvation free energies, and a drug discovery data set. More in-depth validation studies will be conducted by examining the relative binding free energies of inhibitors of the macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF). Finally, exploratory applications will examine mechanisms, characterize transition states and predict rates for covalent inhibition for a series of MIF inhibitors. Next-generation integrated quantum force ﬁelds for biomedical applications PI: Darrin M. York, Laboratory for Biomolecular Simulation Research, Rutgers University, Piscat- away, NJ 08854-8087 USA.

"A Multiwell Plate Format Microfluidic Immobilization Chip for High-Content Imaging of Whole Animals for in vivoNeurotoxicology Testing Project Summary: Neurotoxicological evaluation of new compounds intended for human use or of potential human exposure is mandated by international regulatory bodies and largely relies on lethality testing in higher-order vertebrate animals. High screening costs, long experimental times, and legislative requirements to reduce dependence on animal testing have led many industries to search for alternative technologies. In vitro toxicology testing uses isolated cells or monotypic cell culture and can only provide limited insight since these models lack biologically relevant intact multi-typic cellular network structures. While both technologies have been augmented by in silico technologies, there is still a non-trivial gap between what can be learned and translated from simple, fast, inexpensive in vitro methods versus longer, complex, and costly in vivo studies in higher order animals. Newormics’ approach to filling this gap is to enable in vivo neurotoxicological assessment in Caenorhabditis elegans, an accepted alternative invertebrate model organism, by developing neuron-specific toxicity assays, delivered via a proprietary high-density, large-scale microfluidic immobilization device for high-content, high throughput analysis. Building on advances made during Phase I and important market learnings from participation in the NIH I-Corps program, Phase II proposes several new elements of innovation to achieve our goals in 3 specific aims. In Aim 1, we will convert our first-generation microfluidic device to a high-density (384- well) vivoChip with improved microfabrication technologies, incorporate on-chip culture for transfer-less exposure and testing, and integrate automation for chip loading, imaging, and analysis. These measures will significantly increase test scale (from 80 compounds per chip to 280) and lower the consumable and labor costs per test. In Aim 2, building on our dopaminergic neurotox assay from Phase I, we will develop four neurotox assays with brightly fluorescently labeled dopaminergic, serotonergic, GABAergic, and cholinergic neurons providing the unprecedented ability to assess subtle phenotypic effects of chemicals on individual intact, functional neurons. To achieve real-time image processing, multi-parameter phenotyping, and managing the terabytes of image data generated per test, we will build a computational platform empowered by a graphic user interface. This platform will be used for image compilation, user-annotated phenotype definition and scoring, and automated report generation with appropriate statistical analysis. In Aim 3, with our industry partners, we will validate our platform and assays using reference chemicals. As more chemicals are tested, we will build a database which can be further mined. The outcome of this work will enable many industries to reduce lethal animal testing and get safer industrial and personal consumer products to market faster for economic benefit, reaching regulatory compliance for reduced animal use, and improved healthcare for neurological diseases. Narrative: The proposed work will enable the use of a small invertebrate model organism, C. elegans, for neuron-specific analysis of neurodegeneration phenotypes from high-resolution fluorescence images of individual neurons at high throughputs. The proposed imaging system and the neuron-specific assays will provide an unprecedented ability to assess developmental neurotoxicity in an intact, live, whole organism, down to a neuronal mechanism- of-action level.

"Molecular Dynamics and Artificial Intelligence Based Tools to Innovate Covalent and Noncovalent Drug Design Abstract Cancer and infectious diseases are threatening modern human kind. To combat the challenge, targeted cova- lent inhibition and targeted protein degradation are emerging as the new frontiers in drug discovery. This SBIR project seeks to meet two unmet needs in the emerging covalent as well as traditional reversible drug discovery programs by developing two commercial solutions based on cutting-edge research in molecular simulations and data science. In the Phase I period, ComputChem LLC has developed a local/cloud software application iTitrate that can offer accurate and reliable predictions of protein pKa values and nucleophilic cysteine and lysine. As the ﬁrst of its kind, iTitrate is based on a unique and extensively validated constant pH molecular dynamics approach and a very accurate and efﬁcient generalized Born implicit-solvent model. In Phase I, ComputChem also devel- oped a prototype of a novel small-molecule pKa prediction tool based on artiﬁcial intelligence. Building on the Phase I progress, the objective of the Phase II project is to signiﬁcantly accelerate, enhance, and demonstrate the capabilities of iTitrate and improve the accuracy of iKa. iTitrate can be applied to expedite efforts in a vari- ety of covalent drug discovery programs, including targeted covalent inhibitor design; kinome or proteome wide scanning for covalently targetable sites; protein-protein interaction inhibition; and proteolysis targeting chimera design. iTitrate can be further developed and integrated with iKa to offer a novel solution for accurate protonation state assignment and pH-dependent modeling of protein-ligand complexes, which would add signiﬁcant value to computer-aided lead optimization and other in silico drug design tasks.

"Altering Hepatitis B Virus assembly through pharmacological intervention Project Summary/Abstract Viruses are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) being one of the most infectious and prevalent among them. Roughly 250 million people worldwide suffer from chronic HBV infection, including 1-2 million in the United States. Of those infected, approximately 15-25% will develop se- rious liver problems, including cirrhosis, cancer, and ultimately failure, leading to 600,000 deaths annually. While therapies exist to manage chronic HBV infection, all target viral genomic processes such as reverse transcription and DNA replication, and none provide a cure due to viral persistence and resistance. A promising orthogonal approach to eliminating infection is to target HBV's capsid, the protein shell that encapsulates the viral genome. The Finn laboratory has previously developed compounds that induce the misdirected assembly of non-functional HBV capsids, showing that small molecules have the power to affect the structures of these large multi-protein assemblies. While much is known about the structures of the intermolecular interactions with these compounds identiﬁed after the fact, little about the dynamics of such interactions has been explored, and a predictive under- standing of functional (antiviral) binding has yet to be developed. Both deﬁciencies will begin to be addressed in this program. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations coupled with in vitro experiments on HepAD38 cells, the PIs have identiﬁed seven compounds based on motifs previously unknown to interact with HBV that target the capsid assembly process. These compounds bind in a known pocket at the interface of two capsid-protein (Cp) dimers, possess moderate antiviral activity, and low toxicity. In the ﬁrst aim, using docking, free-energy perturba- tion, and synthetic chemistry, the PIs will optimize the lead compound to improve its efﬁcacy against HBV. In the second aim, using molecular dynamics simulations, advanced free-energy calculations, and experimental assays on different HBV protein oligomers, up to and including the whole virus capsid, the PIs will determine how small molecules interfere with capsid assembly. Both aims will beneﬁt from using a machine-learning-based classiﬁ- cation scheme as well as novel enhanced sampling methods. The lessons learned here concerning how small molecules can re-direct the assembly pathway into unproductive conformations can be generalized for application to other viruses. Project Narrative In spite of the dramatic increase in our understanding of the structure and properties of hepatitis B virus (HBV), this pathogen remains a major threat to human health. That knowledge also makes HBV an important test case for new antiviral strategies. This project aims to limit the impact of HBV by using computer simulations and synthetic chemistry to develop an improved understanding of the assembly process of HBV as well as new drugs that can eliminate HBV infection in ways that may be generalized to other pathogenic viruses.",Altering Hepatitis B Virus assembly through pharmacological intervention,10159864,R01AI148740,"['Affect ', ' Antiviral Agents ', ' Antiviral Drugs ', ' Antivirals ', ' anti-viral agents ', ' anti-viral drugs ', ' anti-virals ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Capsid ', ' Cations ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' computational simulation ', ' computerized simulation ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' HIV-1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' HIV1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Infection ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Methods ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Protein Conformation ', ' Reverse Transcription ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Viral Genome ', ' virus genome ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' viral infection ', ' virus infection ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' Virus ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Encapsulated ', ' Failure ', ' Virus Assembly ', ' viral assembly ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Viral ', ' chronic HBV infection ', ' chronic hepatitis B virus infection ', ' Chronic Hepatitis B ', ' dimer ', ' intermolecular interaction ', ' Molecular Dynamics Simulation ', ' molecular dynamics ', ' success ', ' Cryo-electron Microscopy ', ' Electron Cryomicroscopy ', ' cryo-EM ', ' cryoEM ', ' Cryoelectron Microscopy ', ' DNA Replication ', ' DNA Synthesis ', ' DNA biosynthesis ', ' protein oligomer ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Free Energy ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' drug development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Coat Proteins ', ' Viral Coat Proteins ', ' Viral Outer Coat Protein ', ' Capsid Proteins ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' small molecule ', ' Address ', ' protein structures ', ' proteins structure ', ' protein structure ', ' Protein Dynamics ', ' Synthesis Chemistry ', ' Synthetic Chemistry ', ' Classification Scheme ', ' Scheme ', ' Process ', ' Docking ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Cirrhosis ', ' cirrhotic ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' Hepatitis B Virus ', ' HBV ', ' Homologous Serum Hepatitis Virus ', ' lead optimization ', ' pathogenic virus ', ' viral pathogen ', ' virus pathogen ', ' viral genomics ', ' virus genomics ', ' ']",NIAID,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,393060,GA-05
"Differential Scanning Fluorimetry (DSF) Methods for Studying Protein Stability Abstract. There is great interest in technologies that measure protein stability, because many devastating diseases (e.g. cystic fibrosis, Alzheimer’s disease) are linked to protein misfolding and instability. One especially promising way to treat these diseases is to use small molecules, termed “correctors” that bind to the damaged protein and partially restore its folding. Multiple correctors have received FDA approval (e.g. ivacaftor, tafamadis, migalastat), but there are hundreds of additional misfolding diseases. What are the hurdles to the rapid discovery of additional correctors? One important barrier is that previous correctors have been uncovered through prolonged searches, using specialized (i.e. target-specific) technologies that are not versatile enough for use across many proteins-of-interest (POIs). Here, we propose next-generation Differential Scanning Fluorimetry (DSF) to fill this gap. In a typical DSF experiment, a POI is heated in a qPCR instrument and its un-folding is monitored by its binding to a solvatochromatic dye (e.g. Sypro Orange, SO). The resulting temperature vs. fluorescence curves are then used to estimate the melting transition (Tm), with putative correctors identified by their effect on this value (DTm). DSF is versatile because it does not require protein labeling or structural knowledge. Moreover, unlike comparable platforms, such as circular dichroism (CD) or differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), DSF is amenable to 384-well plate format, facilitating large-scale chemical screens. While DSF has the potential to transform corrector discovery, there are major hurdles to overcome. For example, DSF often fails because SO does not bind the target protein or it binds to hydrophobic patches on the native state, obscuring the Tm. Further, for some POIs, the temperature-fluorescence curves are complex, with multiple transitions, and therefore not readily analyzed or fit using standard equations. Based on our preliminary screens of ~50 different proteins, these issues cause DSF to fail in more than 60% of cases. We propose to solve these issues through disruptive innovations: (SA1) Design and synthesis of next-generation dye libraries that significantly expand the scope of DSF and (SA2) Theory- and experiment-driven, dramatic improvements in data analysis, enabled by machine learning and made publicly available through a web portal (DSFWorld). Encouraged by preliminary success, we also propose to: (SA3) Expand the scope of DSF applications by pioneering studies of multi-protein complexes and conformational changes. Importantly, we will benchmark each of these innovations against current state-of-the-art approaches, with a focus on a critical understanding of strengths and weaknesses. Together, these studies are expected to dramatically expand the scope of DSF technology. PROJECT NARRATIVE. Protein instability is the cause of many devastating and untreatable human diseases.

"Simulation of Proton Translocation in Biomolecules PROJECT SUMMARY  The transport of protons in biomolecular systems is a phenomenon of fundamental importance to processes such as ATP synthesis, enzyme catalysis, the maintenance of pH gradients, proton pumping, viral infection, and substrate/ion transport across membranes via protein transporters, symporters, and antiporters. Modeling biomolecular proton translocation in silico is a significant challenge due to the complex chemical reactions involved in Grotthuss proton shutting between water molecules and with protonatable amino acids, as well as the complexity of the target biomolecular systems. In most cases, it is not only important to understand the mechanism of proton binding and transport, but also its coupling to other mechanistically relevant biomolecular processes, such as protein conformational changes, substrate binding, other protonation events, and dynamic hydration.  In this project the continued development and application of a powerful multiscale computer simulation methodology is described for the study of proton transport in several key classes of proton translocating biomolecular systems, including channels (influenza A and B M2 channels), antiporters/symporters (ClC Cl-/H+ antiporter and phosphate transporter, respectively), and transporters (proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter and EmrE multidrug transporter). The overall research plan is made possible by a novel reactive molecular dynamics simulation approach integrated with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods that allows for the study of explicit long-length and -time scale proton transport through water molecules and ionizable molecular groups in hydrogen-bonded networks, as well as by new innovations in enhanced free energy sampling methodology, machine learning, kinetic network theory, and coarse-graining. A primary goal in the research with this methodology in hand is to reveal the mechanisms of proton transport, as well as its coupling to hydration and conformational changes, in the above mentioned biomolecular systems. All of these studies will be carried out in collaboration with leading experimentalists, while continuing to add a new dimension to the field of biomolecular computer simulation as a whole. 1 PROJECT NARRATIVE  In this project, computer simulations will be used to study proton transport in several important biomolecular systems. Proton translocation is of fundamental significance throughout biology, as demonstrated by the pH-dependence of biomolecular structure and function and the central role of transmembrane proton gradients in bioenergy conversion. Moreover, understanding proton transport is of fundamental importance and direct relevance to numerous aspects of human health, including metabolism, aging, diabetes, neurodegeneration, retinal degeneration, antivral and anti-bacterial therapeutics, and homeostasis. 1",Simulation of Proton Translocation in Biomolecules,10167719,R01GM053148,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Aging ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Anions ', ' Behavior ', ' Sampling Biases ', ' Biology ', ' Carrier Proteins ', ' Transport Protein Gene ', ' Transport Proteins ', ' Transporter Protein ', ' Catalysis ', ' Charge ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' computational simulation ', ' computerized simulation ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diffusion ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Elements ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Proton Pump ', ' H(+) Pump ', ' H+ Pump ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hydrogen Bonding ', ' H-bond ', ' Influenza ', ' Grippe ', ' Kinetics ', ' Maintenance ', ' Medicine ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' Motion ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Oligopeptides ', ' inorganic phosphate ', ' Phosphates ', ' Protein Conformation ', ' Proteins ', ' Protons ', ' H+ element ', ' Hydrogen Ions ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Retinal Degeneration ', ' degenerative retina diseases ', ' retina degeneration ', ' retinal degenerative ', ' retinal degenerative diseases ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Specificity ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' viral infection ', ' virus infection ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Wisconsin ', ' antiporter ', ' Ion Transport ', ' protonation ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' insight ', ' Progress Reports ', ' Funding ', ' Anti-Bacterial Agents ', ' Antibacterial Agents ', ' anti-bacterial ', ' antibacterial ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Therapeutic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Entropy ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Event ', ' Reaction ', ' System ', ' Consult ', ' chemical reaction ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' Molecular Dynamics Simulation ', ' molecular dynamics ', ' Co-Transporters ', ' symporter ', ' Free Energy ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' chemical bond ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' molecular mechanics ', ' Phosphate Transport Proteins ', ' Phosphate Transporters ', ' Inorganic Phosphate Transporter ', ' Influenza A ', ' Influenza Viruses Type A ', ' Influenzavirus A ', ' Orthomyxovirus Type A ', ' Type A Influenza ', ' Influenza A virus ', ' Influenza B ', ' Influenza Viruses Type B ', ' Orthomyxoviruses Type B ', ' Influenza B Virus ', ' delta pH ', ' deltapH ', ' pH gradient ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Hydration ', ' Hydration status ', ' Length ', ' Defect ', ' ATP Synthesis ', ' ATP Synthesis Pathway ', ' Data ', ' Quantum Mechanics ', ' Transport Process ', ' Molecular Transport ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' anti-influenza drug ', ' anti-flu drug ', ' antiflu drug ', ' quantum ', ' Outcome ', ' migration ', ' Coupled ', ' Coupling ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multi drug transporter ', ' multidrug transporter ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' Grain ', ' in silico ', ' kinetic model ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2021,310328,IL-01
"A Preclinical Program for Targeting Mycobacterium tuberculosis KasA ABSTRACT  We present herein a grant application focused on the late-stage development of preclinical candidate JSF-3285. Per our recently published research, we have disclosed the genesis of this program that led to the hit compound DG167 and identification of the essential β-keto acyl synthase KasA as its target. Building on this effort, our preliminary data detail the optimization to arrive at JSF-3285 which is efficacious in the acute and chronic models of M. tuberculosis infection in mice at doses as low as 5 mg/kg once-daily oral. This proposal seeks to build on this data by conducting the requisite drug combination and relapse studies to achieve clinical status and begin IND-enabling studies. In addition, we propose a second generation program based on preliminary data consisting of a structurally distinct amide series with promising in vitro efficacy, mouse PK, and X-ray structural data. The grant's second aim will evolve this series, leveraging our extensive X-ray structural data, SAR, and machine learning models, to produce at minimum novel early lead compounds if not compounds equal to or surpassing JSF-3285. The sum total of the two aims, featuring JSF-3285 and second generation candidate/s, will lend a high probability to a KasA inhibitor becoming clinically relevant in the next 5 years. PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFIT  This proposal will develop a new therapy that will help to cure drug-susceptible and drug-resistant forms of tuberculosis. It will also have the potential to reduce the length of time need to treat tuberculosis and inhibit new resistance from occurring.

"Determination of structure, dynamics and energetics of enzyme reactions Project Summary  Understanding enzyme mechanisms is of paramount importance from both the basic biophysics perspective of understanding life processes and the role of enzymes in diseases. To achieve a detailed understanding of enzyme catalysis, the effects of protein structure and dynamics on the reaction energetics need to be elucidated. We propose a combined computational and experimental approach that combines the synthetic, computational and structural biology expertise of a team of investigators that has been working together for >15 years to create a “molecular movie” where the position, movement and energy of every atom in the system followed over the entire reaction pathway. The proposal exploits the emerging convergence of timescales accessible by molecular simulation using GPUs and time resolved structural biology. Specific Aim 1 describes the simulation of the complete reaction pathway of Pseudomonas mevalonii (Pm) HMGCoA Reductase (HMGR) and will use transition state force fields (TSFFs) generated by the quantum guided molecular mechanics method to allow the µsec MD simulations of the chemical steps. TSFFs not only circumvent the well-known boundary problem of QM/MM, but are also 102-104 times faster. This allows a realistic modeling of the coupling of µsec dynamics and catalysis that was demonstrated in the last grant period to be essential for understanding the reaction. Together with accelerated MD simulations of the conformational changes involved in the reaction using standard force fields, these computational studies cover the fsec to µsec timescale. In Specific Aim 2, the computational results will be merged with the results of a three-tiered approach to obtain structural snapshots with progressively increasing time resolution: (i) “Frozen” intermediates that map out the overall pathway on long timescales, (ii) time resolved Laue crystallography using pH jump initiation on the msec timescale and (iii) use of photocaged substrates to allow time resolved Laue experiments on the µsec timescale. This approach will be applied to the study of HMGR, an enzyme of high biophysical and biomedical significance that has a complex reaction mechanism involving three chemical steps, six large-scale conformational changes and two cofactor exchange steps. The project is highly innovative because it (i) uses a combination of MD simulations using TSFFs and time resolved crystallography to span timescales of at least 12 orders of magnitude, (ii) iteratively couples the Markov State analysis of long timescale trajectories to the Singular Value Decomposition used to analyze time resolved crystallography data, thus providing new tools to generate and experimentally validate trial structures (iii) applies global optimization and machine learning techniques to allow the automated fitting of TSFFs for proteins, which will enhance the application of this powerful method to other proteins and (iv) provides new photocaged substrates for the study of enzyme mechanisms to the chemical biology community. All tool compounds, methods and codes developed in this project will be made available to the scientific community. Public Health Statement  The detailed study of enzyme mechanisms is a cornerstone of biophysical chemistry that, while basic in nature, has had a major impact on human health including the development of new mechanism-based drugs for a range of diseases and an understanding of the mechanism of action for existing drugs that allows the design of combination therapies. The combination of Laue crystallography and long-scale MD simulations will allow simultaneous studies of structure, dynamics and energetic studies with unprecedented detail. The application to HMG CoA Reductase, arguably the single most important drug target in western industrialized countries, will demonstrate the applicability of the methodology to an enzyme of high mechanistic complexity. 1","Determination of structure, dynamics and energetics of enzyme reactions",10266027,R01GM111645,"['Biochemistry ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Biology ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Catalysis ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Combined Modality Therapy ', ' Multimodal Therapy ', ' Multimodal Treatment ', ' combination therapy ', ' combined modality treatment ', ' combined treatment ', ' multi-modal therapy ', ' multi-modal treatment ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Couples ', ' Crystallization ', ' Crystallography ', ' Crystallographies ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Freezing ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase ', ' 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA Reductase ', ' HMG CoA Reductases ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Oxidoreductase ', ' Dehydrogenases ', ' Oxidoreductase Gene ', ' Reductases ', ' Proteins ', ' Pseudomonas ', ' Chrysemonas ', ' Flavimonas ', ' Public Health ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Science ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' X-Ray Radiation ', ' X-ray ', ' Xray ', ' Mutagenesis ', ' Genetics-Mutagenesis ', ' Mutagenesis Molecular Biology ', ' base ', ' cofactor ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Active Sites ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Anti-Bacterial Agents ', ' Antibacterial Agents ', ' anti-bacterial ', ' antibacterial ', ' Collaborations ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' developed country ', ' developed nation ', ' developed nations ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' computer biology ', ' Computational Biology ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Msec ', ' millisecond ', ' Complex ', ' Reaction ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' electron density ', ' enzyme mechanism ', ' experience ', ' Molecular Dynamics Simulation ', ' molecular dynamics ', ' particle ', ' structural biology ', ' biophysical chemistry ', ' Free Energy ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' movie ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' molecular mechanics ', ' protein structures ', ' proteins structure ', ' protein structure ', ' Data ', ' Protein Dynamics ', ' Resolution ', ' Validation ', ' Enzymatic Biochemistry ', ' Enzymology ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' computer studies ', ' computational studies ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' molecular scale ', ' quantum ', ' Coupling ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' synthetic biology ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' new drug target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new therapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2021,321539,IN-02
"Inverted Spectroscopic Infrared Microscope (ISIM) for High Throughput Multi-Dimensional Cell Assays Abstract The goal of this research is to develop a novel spectroscopic cellular assay that will enable us to measure the real-time intra-cellular response of a cell to various extra-cellular stimuli. The uniqueness of our approach relies on several innovations. We will construct an Inverted Spectral Infrared Microscope (ISIM) based on Fourier- transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and combining it with a novel biosensor based on plasmonic nanostructures (metasurfaces). The biosensor will be integrated with multi-well plates to enable high- throughput. The proposed assay will detect biochemical and morphological changes of the cell, with the emphasis on the reorganization of the cellular membrane and its cytoskeleton. The multi-dimensional nature of the spectroscopic data will enable the application of machine learning techniques and improve its sensitivity in comparison with traditional one-dimensional real-time assays. To our knowledge, this will be the first real-time cellular assay that satisfies all of the four requirements below: (i) high throughput, (ii) multi-dimensionality of the collected time-dependent data, (iii) specific focus on biochemical changes of the cell, and (iv) focus on the changes occurring in close proximity of the cellular membrane. The assay will be validated using very common external stimuli of the cell, such as small-molecule compounds acting on G-protein coupled receptors. Relevance Statement: The goal of our program is to develop a novel multi-dimensional real-time cell assay. This will be accomplished by constructing an FTIR-based inverted spectral infrared microscope (ISIM) and combining it with a novel biosensor. The biosensor is based on the integration of plasmonic metasurface fabricated on an infrared-transparent glass with multi-well microtiter plates. The proposed geometry will enable high throughput while the metasurface will dramatically enhance the signal-to-noise ratio and reduce the penetration depth of the infrared light into the cell. These innovations will enable us to quantify the effects of extra-cellular signaling on the excitation of intra-cellular signaling pathways.
