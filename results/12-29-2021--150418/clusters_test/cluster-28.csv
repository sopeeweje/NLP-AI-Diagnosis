"PED Screen: Pediatric Sepsis EHR Registry, Clinical Outcomes, and Predictive Model Project Summary/Abstract Each year over 75,000 children develop sepsis in the United States resulting in substantial morbidity, up to 20% mortality, and billions in US health care expenditures. There have been substantial advances that demonstrate improved patient outcomes with adherence to early aggressive emergency care. However, methods to accurately, reliably, and rapidly identify children who require these resource-intensive therapies are lacking. In addition, understanding the impact of these therapies on near-term outcomes, before significant morbidity occurs, is also lacking. Current algorithms do not reliably discriminate between patients who develop sepsis and those who are clinically similar upon initial presentation but do not progress to sepsis. As a result, children requiring life-saving treatments do not receive them, or do not receive them in a timely fashion, and others may be over-treated, wasting healthcare resources and potentially diverting emergency care from those in need. With the advent of electronic health records (EHR), there are now information-enabled solutions that offer unique opportunities to identify non-biased, heterogeneous samples of children and allow us to accurately and reliably measure risk factors and near-term outcomes for sepsis. This work addresses the critical need to improve pediatric sepsis outcomes by developing methods to accurately identify at-risk children presenting for emergency care. Utilizing the infrastructure of the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN), this proposal will innovatively capture EHR data to create a multi-center registry with the ultimate goal to improve the detection and treatment of pediatric sepsis in the ED setting. To accomplish this, we propose the following specific aims: We will develop an expanded multicenter sepsis registry for pediatric patients from merged electronic health record clinical data from different hospitals with different EHR data sources. We will automate the determination of organ dysfunction in children with sepsis directly from structured and narrative data within the multicenter EHR registry. From the registry and outcome data, we will derive and validate a prediction model of pediatric sepsis using emergency department EHR data from the first 4 hours of care that predicts subsequent organ dysfunction within 48 hours. Each of these aims works to the goal of improving the emergent care for pediatric sepsis with innovative deliverables from this project including the existence of a broad and rich EHR registry, an automated process of outcome determination, and a prediction model of risk of sepsis. We will also have a strong foundation for future projects to implement and evaluate decision support tools, improve diagnostic techniques, engage in comparative effectiveness studies, measure quality of care, establish linked bio-repositories, and guide clinical trial design. The proposed project, thus, has enormous potential to improve our ability to improve the quality of care provided to our most acutely ill children.  Project Narrative Sepsis is a leading cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality with life-saving treatment dependent on early and accurate identification. We will establish a multi-center data registry from electronic health records (EHR), identify a multi-center cohort of pediatric patients at risk for sepsis, automate sepsis-related pediatric organ dysfunction directly from the registry EHR data, and develop an emergency department based prediction model of sepsis related organ dysfunction. Each of these aims has the ultimate goal of improving the emergent care for pediatric sepsis with innovative deliverables from this project including the existence of a broad and rich EHR registry, the automated process of important proximal outcome determination, and an emergency department prediction model of risk of sepsis. ","PED Screen: Pediatric Sepsis EHR Registry, Clinical Outcomes, and Predictive Model",10102260,R01HD087363,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Algorithms ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' health care expenditure ', ' healthcare expenditure ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Savings ', ' Shock ', ' Circulatory Collapse ', ' circulatory shock ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' AHCPR ', ' AHRQ ', ' Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' wasting ', ' Measurement ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Visit ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Applied Science ', ' Applied Research ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' patient registry ', ' Organ failure ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' Derivation procedure ', ' Derivation ', ' Emergency Care ', ' ED care ', ' ER care ', ' Emergency Department care ', ' Emergency Room care ', ' Emergency health care ', ' Emergency healthcare ', ' Emergency medical care ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Sepsis ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' data registry ', ' Emergent care ', ' pediatric patients ', ' child patients ', ' support tools ', ' electronic registry ', ' pediatric emergency ', ' septic patients ', ' sepsis patients ', ' Infrastructure ', ' risk prediction model ', ' Pediatric cohort ', ' comparative effectiveness study ', ' patient health information ', ' patient health record ', ' patient medical record ', ' ']",NICHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,597143,IL-07
"FreeSurfer Development, Maintenance, and Hardening Abstract: Imaging of the human brain has seen explosive growth in the last two decades mainly through the various modalities of MRI. The massive amount of data requires automatic and robust tools for analysis. FreeSurfer (FS, surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) is one of the preeminent tools used for neuroimage analysis. FS has more than 44,000 downloads, and the core FS manuscripts have been cited more than 22,000 times. FS is part of the analysis core for many NIH-funded large-scale data acquisition projects such as the Human Connectome Project (HCP), Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), Framingham Heart Study (FHS), The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD), as well as the UK BioBank. One third of the 600+ ADNI-based publications cite FS. Simply put, much of the innovative research done in neuroimaging would not be possible without FS. Started in 1998, FS is best known for providing detailed and automated anatomical analysis of T1-weighted MRI images, especially for the cortical surface. However, FS anatomical analysis provides an ideal substrate for all modes of brain imaging including functional MRI, diffusion MRI, PET, optical/NIRS, as well as EEG/MEG. FS provides tools to perform these analyses as well as software to integrate with other analysis tools (e.g., SPM, FSL, AFNI). FS has been used for presurgical planning and even in the operating room.  The original grant mostly centered around Sequence Adaptive Multimodal Segmentation (SAMSEG). SAMSEG uses parametric Bayesian generative modeling to segment brain images. The SAMSEG framework fits atlas priors and multivariate Gaussian intensity models to brain images (including MRI artifacts such as bias fields). SAMSEG can take any modality or combination of modalities as input. Since it adapts its intensity model, it is robust to differences in scanner. Since it is a generative model, it is easy to extend to encompass more segmentation details. For example, the SAMSEG framework has been used to segment hippocampal subfield, amygdalar nuclei, thalamic nuclei, and extracerebral structures.  The main vision for the renewal is to extend the SAMSEG framework to accommodate longitudinal models, incorporate more anatomical details, and to use SAMSEG output as a basis for cortical surface placement that is, like SAMSEG, modality independent and capable of using any combination of modalities. In addition, we propose a series of new tools that will assist in the individual and group analysis of large studies by creating study-specific models. In addition to this new technical development, we are requesting support for software engineering, maintenance, and user support – mundane and not innovative, but high-impact this type of support is critical to the thousands of researchers who rely on FreeSurfer. Narrative: This work will support the popular FreeSurfer neuroimaging analysis software program used by thousands of researchers world-wide. FreeSurfer uses cutting edge algorithms to automatically extract a host of biomarkers from brain imaging data which can be used for research, pharmaceutical evaluation, and diagnosis. This proposal will allow for continued support of FreeSurfer from the developers as well as new development to make FreeSurfer faster, more robust, and easier to interpret.","FreeSurfer Development, Maintenance, and Hardening",10130964,R01EB023281,"['Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Atlases ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' bone ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Engineering ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Industrialization ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maintenance ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Operating Rooms ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' PET ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET imaging ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PETT ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' Probability ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' cranium ', ' Skull ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Engineering ', ' Computer Software Development ', ' Computer Software Engineering ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic Nuclei ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' base ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Surface ', ' Series ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Evaluation ', ' Lesion ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' programs ', ' Hereditary ', ' Inherited ', ' Stream ', ' System ', ' success ', ' synergism ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Modality ', ' Modeling ', ' Free Will ', ' Documentation ', ' Leukoaraiosis ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Data ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' Multiple Sclerosis Lesions ', ' MS Lesions ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' data acquisition ', ' Framingham Heart Study ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' Bayesian Modeling ', ' Bayesian adaptive designs ', ' Bayesian adaptive models ', ' Bayesian belief network ', ' Bayesian belief updating model ', ' Bayesian framework ', ' Bayesian hierarchical model ', ' Bayesian network model ', ' Bayesian nonparametric models ', ' Bayesian spatial data model ', ' Bayesian spatial image models ', ' Bayesian spatial models ', ' Bayesian statistical models ', ' Bayesian tracking algorithms ', ' cognitive development ', ' Gaussian model ', ' Gaussian statistics ', ' Gaussianity ', ' Gaussianity model ', ' connectome ', ' human imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' ']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,555356,MA-08
"Characterizing patients at risk for sepsis through Big Data Characterizing Patients at Risk for Sepsis Through Big Data SUMMARY The goal of this KL2 research proposal is create an extension of an existing data-driven sepsis algorithm, the artificial intelligence sepsis expert (AISE), by forecasting the type and sequence of sepsis-specific organ failure using clinical data from the electronic medical record, then identifying the incremental benefit received by adding high-resolution data derived from cardiovascular waveforms (arterial waveform and electrocardiographic waves), and small molecule metabolite data over time to provide some mechanistic context. The most important data (features) used in real-time from AISE will be used as inputs for a fuzzy k- means clustering algorithm (“Saving Organs from Sepsis”, or SOS) using retrospectively-collected data, designed to better characterize patients at risk for sepsis by their organ failure. I have selected three organs in particular: shock, acute respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury (AKI). Principal component analyses (PCA) data from 2,375 ICU patients with sepsis will be projected onto a novel visual representation for patient phenotyping based on risk of (trajectory toward) different types of organ failure. I will identify if this SOS algorithm can accurately forecast new organ failure within 12 hours based on SOS. To better understand the impact of specific features on organ failure, I will test the ability of each high- resolution features, and metabolomics data to forecast septic shock. Among those who develop septic shock, I will measure all nine high-resolution features from the beginning of the ICU stay up to shock onset and compare those changes to those who develop sepsis but not septic shock, and those who do not develop sepsis. I will then see if the collective addition of high-resolution data improves performance of septic shock forecasting. Finally, I will conduct a prospective observational study to collect metabolomic information in a 60- patient study to identify the incremental improvement of adding metabolomics data to SOS for predicting septic shock, over SOS with just EMR and waveform data. The results of this work will provide preliminary data for further career development and NIH-funding. The long-term goal would be to build a model that optimizes the timing of appropriate therapy, thus decreasing the incidence of sepsis and associated organ failure. As a K23 candidate, I will use this award to acquire formal didactic training and more hands-on experience in machine learning, signal processing, metabolomics analysis. I will seek focused training that will complement my experience as a clinical trialist so that I can design high-quality studies to contribute to Big Data analytics in critical care research and practice. My overarching career goal is to become a leader in the application of Big Data analysis of critically ill patients to predict progression of disease, specifically sepsis. The Emory environment is an ideal place to develop these capabilities. Emory Healthcare houses over 200 medical, surgical, and subspecialty ICU beds, many of which are “wired” to store streaming data. In addition to the physical resources, my development will be enhanced by my superb mentorship team, led by Dr. Greg Martin. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sepsis, the body’s response to a life-threatening infection that causes damage to itself, is a leading cause of death in the U.S. and around the world, and failure of vital organs is one of the biggest contributors. This project is designed to predict organ failure specific to sepsis using cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology using readily-available information, and experimental blood tests.

"Sepsis phenotypes at risk for infections caused by multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacilli: elucidating the impact of sepsis definition and patient case mix on prediction performance PROJECT ABSTRACT Sepsis is a devastating syndrome that represents a leading cause of death, morbidity, and healthcare costs. Its impact is amplified by rising rates of antimicrobial resistance. Improving sepsis outcomes primarily results from prescribing timely antibiotics based on the estimated risk of multidrug resistance (MDR). Previous models grossly overestimated the MDR risk and exacerbated the escalating rates of antimicrobial resistance and excess mortality. The overall goal of this proposed K08 research is to identify common sepsis phenotypes that will enable better prescribing practices and standardized comparisons across hospitals, which will help practicing clinicians, researchers, healthcare institutions, and policy makers. These themes correlate with NIGMS's interest in finding innovative methods and leveraging big data to improve sepsis outcomes. Our three specific aims reflect these goals: (1) establish resistance thresholds for MDR Gram- negative bacilli (GNB) that cause sepsis, (2) assess the impact of sepsis definition on the performance of risk prediction models for MDR GNB, and (3) identify sepsis phenotypes at high risk for MDR GNB in a well-balanced cohort and assess the impact of case mix on risk prediction model performance. We will mathematically derive resistance thresholds that link population resistance rates to individual patient risk of death in sepsis caused by MDR GNB, assess factors that impact prediction performance, and incorporate rich clinical data from 15 hospitals in our healthcare system to identify stable common sepsis phenotypes. Dr. Vazquez Guillamet has training in Infectious Diseases and Critical Care Medicine and experience in antimicrobial resistance in critically ill patients. This proposal will build on her clinical work and previous research experience in finding innovative methods to solve challenging problems at the intersection of infectious diseases and critical care medicine. Dr. Vazquez Guillamet has six career objectives: (1) pursue advanced training in clinical epidemiology; (2) acquire skills in advanced linear regression and multilevel modeling; (3) learn supervised machine learning methods; (4) acquire skills in big data management in healthcare and methods to handle missing data; (5) improve scientific communication, grantsmanship, and leadership, and (6) participate in training in the responsible conduct of research. She will achieve these goals through didactic coursework, hands-on research experience, and active mentoring from experts in Infectious Diseases, Critical Care Medicine, and applied clinical informatics. She will continue to develop innovative methods to mitigate the antimicrobial resistance crisis, especially in critically ill patients, and become an analytics translator at the intersection of clinical medicine and clinical applied informatics. The fertile research environment at Washington University in St. Louis, the experienced mentorship team, and a well-crafted career development plan will enable Dr. Vazquez Guillamet to achieve her long-term goal of becoming an independently funded clinician-investigator utilizing big data to develop applications for risk prediction, surveillance, and outcome comparisons in antimicrobial resistance and sepsis. PROJECT NARRATIVE The significant burden of sepsis augmented by the escalating rates of antimicrobial resistance has incited many national performance improvement initiatives. Research efforts have focused on predicting patients at risk for infections caused by multidrug resistant pathogens but existing models have led to risk overestimation thus promoting indiscriminate antimicrobial use and further fueling the emergence of resistance. The candidate, Dr. Vazquez Guillamet has focused on innovative ways to assess the impact of antimicrobial resistance and to develop generalizable useful risk prediction models. The current proposed research expands her previous work with the overall goal to develop clinical decision support tools that will improve antibiotic prescribing practices and will allow valid, case-mix adjusted comparisons across hospitals in terms of resistance prevalence rates and antimicrobial use.",Sepsis phenotypes at risk for infections caused by multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacilli: elucidating the impact of sepsis definition and patient case mix on prediction performance,10256063,K08GM140310,"['Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Bacillus ', ' Case Mixes ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Communication ', ' Critical Care ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Environment ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Hospitals ', ' Infection ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Standardization ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Excess Mortality ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Development Plans ', ' Multi-Drug Resistance ', ' Multidrug Resistance ', ' Multiple Drug Resistance ', ' Multiple Drug Resistant ', ' Resistance to Multi-drug ', ' Resistance to Multidrug ', ' Resistance to Multiple Drug ', ' Resistant to Multiple Drug ', ' Resistant to multi-drug ', ' Resistant to multidrug ', ' multi-drug resistant ', ' multidrug resistant ', ' Funding ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' tool ', ' Antibiotic Treatment ', ' bacterial disease treatment ', ' bacterial infectious disease treatment ', ' Antibiotic Therapy ', ' Empiricism ', ' Life ', ' Frequencies ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Informatics ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' multi-level model ', ' multilevel model ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Institution ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Antimicrobial resistant ', ' Resistance to antimicrobial ', ' anti-microbial resistance ', ' anti-microbial resistant ', ' resistance to anti-microbial ', ' resistant to anti-microbial ', ' resistant to antimicrobial ', ' Antimicrobial Resistance ', ' Data ', ' NIGMS ', ' National Institute of General Medical Sciences ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' attributable mortality ', ' attributable death ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Sepsis ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' antimicrobial ', ' anti-microbial ', ' user-friendly ', ' clinical epidemiology ', ' high risk ', ' combat ', ' clinical care ', ' primary outcome ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' multi-drug resistant pathogen ', ' MDR organism ', ' MDR pathogen ', ' multi-drug resistant organism ', ' multidrug resistant organism ', ' multidrug resistant pathogen ', ' multiple drug resistant organism ', ' multiple drug resistant pathogen ', ' support tools ', ' hands on research ', ' individual patient ', ' predictive tools ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' clinical decision support ', ' septic patients ', ' sepsis patients ', ' personalized risk prediction ', ' Individualized risk prediction ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' risk prediction model ', ' infection risk ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' clinical database ', ' big data management ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K08,2021,165542,MO-01
"Using Clinical Treatment Data in a Machine Learning Approach for Sepsis Detection Abstract Significance: We propose to evaluate the performance of HindSight in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). HindSight is a novel encoding software designed to optimize alerts for sepsis prediction and detection. HindSight identifies clinicians’ sepsis-related decisions in the electronic health records of former patients and then uses these events to supply InSight with labeled examples of true positive sepsis cases. In our retrospective work, we have shown that HindSight enables InSight to adapt to the idiosyncrasies of real-world clinical deployment by successfully reducing false and irrelevant alarms, without human supervision. The goal of this project is to demonstrate that the retrospective success of HindSight can be successfully translated to live clinical environments. Research Question: To what extent can a machine-learning-based labeler, which has retrospectively learned to autonomously label sepsis cases according to a clinician-labeled sepsis gold standard, successfully reduce false alerts in a prospective RCT? Will this tool perform more successfully than a sepsis CDS tool that is not designed to autonomously reproduce clinician identification of sepsis? Prior Work: In our Phase I work, HindSight achieved an AUROC of 0.899, 0.831 and 0.877 for clinician sepsis evaluation, treatment, and onset, respectively. By using an online learning algorithm to incorporate HindSight-labeled data into the InSight predictor, we showed that the online-trained InSight can adapt to the HindSight-labeled data and outperform both baseline and periodically re-trained versions of InSight (p < 0.05). Specific Aims: To prospectively validate HindSight’s performance on real-time patient data streams in four diverse hospitals non-interventionally (Aim 1); and to evaluate the effect of the tool in a prospective, interventional RCT (Aim 2). Methods: HindSight will be evaluated in the background at four academic and community hospitals. Following any necessary algorithm optimization arising from live hospital validation, we will perform an RCT to evaluate reductions in false alerts from InSight trained on HindSight sepsis labels (experimental arm), compared to InSight trained on gold standard Sepsis-3 labels (control arm). The primary outcome measure of interest will be false alert reduction. Successful completion of Aim 1 will be demonstrated by a positive predictive value (PPV) in a live clinical setting for which the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval meets or exceeds the benchmark from prior retrospective studies. Meeting the retrospective PPV benchmark indicates that prospective CDS quality reflects retrospective CDS quality, and is sufficiently high to reduce alarm fatigue and improve clinical utility. Success of Aim 2 is contingent upon achieving a 15% relative reduction in false alerts when comparing between the two treatment arms (p < 0.05; Fisher’s Exact Test). Future Directions: The clinical validation of HindSight’s impact on reducing false alerts in a multi-center, cross-ward RCT will demonstrate that alerts match local clinical practice and will promote commercial expansion to new hospital systems. Narrative Machine learning is a powerful method for creating clinical decision support (CDS) tools, when training labels reflect the desired alert behavior. In our Phase I work for this project we developed HindSight, an encoding software designed to examine discharged patients’ electronic health records (EHR), identify clinicians’ sepsis treatment decisions and patient outcomes, and pass these labeled examples to an online algorithm for retraining of InSight, our machine-learning-based CDS tool for real-time sepsis prediction.

AcidoCEST MRI with an exogenous contrast agent is an innovative variation of this technique that measures extracellular pH in solid tumors. We have also developed an exceptionally innovative method that acquires endogenous CEST MR images with multiple powers, which can measure the chemical exchange rate of endogenous proteins that can assess relative differences in pH. We will improve our CEST MRI acquisition methods by accelerating the imaging speed, reducing and eliminating complications due to patient motion, eliminating complications caused by fat signal, and expanding to 3D imaging methods. We will also improve image analysis methods that are required for CEST contrast from endogenous proteins and exogenous contrast agents.  Our research has strong impact because acidoCEST MRI can track changes in tumor acidosis in response to chemotherapy and chemoradiation therapy in patients who have breast cancer and head & neck cancer. Endogenous CEST MRI can improve the diagnoses of brain tumor recurrence vs. pseudoprogression, and evaluations of lung cancer vs. lung infection. We will perform clinical studies with our endogenous and exogenous CEST MRI methods to image patients with brain, breast, lung, and head & neck cancers.  To amplify the impact of our research, we will develop versions of our CEST MRI acquisition methods for the many versions of the 13 Siemens hardware platforms and software operating systems at the MD Anderson Cancer Center. We will also develop user-friendly CEST analysis methods for many researchers at MD Anderson. We will leverage our unique research environment and expertise with intra-institutional dissemination to provide inter-institutional dissemination, by sharing share these acquisition and analysis tools with other CEST MRI researchers. We will collaborate with NIST to provide the first CEST MRI phantom that can standardize the development and implementation of intra- and inter-institutional CEST MRI methods.  Our team of outstanding investigators includes experts in CEST saturation methods, CEST MR image analysis, clinical contrast agents, rapid MRI acquisition methods, high field 7T MRI, clinical radiology, biostatistics, histopathology and oncology. Based on our expertise and years of productivity in clinical CEST MRI, we have developed an exceptional research approach. As the world's largest cancer center and a health destination, the MD Anderson Cancer Center has the patient population that provides very strong institutional support for our clinical studies. NARRATIVE We will develop new acquisition and analysis methods that assess tumor acidosis with CEST MRI, using exogenous CEST agents and endogenous sources of CEST contrast. We will apply our new methods to evaluate tumor acidosis in patients with breast cancer, head & neck cancer, lung cancer, and brain cancers. We will disseminate our CEST MRI acquisition and analysis methods to other CEST MRI researchers, along with a NIST-approved standard for clinical CEST MRI studies.",Development and Dissemination of Clinical CEST MRI Acquisition and Analysis Methods for Cancer Imaging Applications,10231170,R01CA231513,"['Acidosis ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Neoplasms ', ' Brain Neoplasia ', ' Brain Tumors ', ' tumors in the brain ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Contrast Media ', ' Contrast Agent ', ' Contrast Drugs ', ' Radiopaque Media ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Glioblastoma ', ' Grade IV Astrocytic Neoplasm ', ' Grade IV Astrocytic Tumor ', ' Grade IV Astrocytoma ', ' glioblastoma multiforme ', ' spongioblastoma multiforme ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Patients ', ' Productivity ', ' Proteins ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' radio-therapy ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Destinations ', ' Measures ', ' Malignant neoplasm of brain ', ' Brain Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Brain ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' lung imaging ', ' Pulmonary imaging ', ' lung scanning ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Ensure ', ' Chemicals ', ' Evaluation ', ' Lesion ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' lung cancer ', ' Oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Head and Neck Cancer ', ' Malignant Head and Neck Neoplasm ', ' head/neck cancer ', ' malignant head and neck tumor ', ' Solid Neoplasm ', ' Solid Tumor ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' chemo-/radio-therapy ', ' chemo-radio-therapy ', ' chemo-radiotherapy ', ' chemoradiotherapy ', ' radio-chemo-therapy ', ' radio-chemotherapy ', ' radiochemotherapy ', ' chemoradiation ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' extracellular ', ' respiratory ', ' interest ', ' Histopathology ', ' Speed ', ' Malignant Neck Neoplasm ', ' malignant neck tumor ', ' Neck Cancer ', ' Head Cancer ', ' response ', ' 3-D Imaging ', ' 3D imaging ', ' Three-Dimensional Imaging ', ' Ovarian Tumor ', ' Ovary Neoplasms ', ' Ovary Tumor ', ' ovarian neoplasm ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' chemical standard ', ' Address ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' in vivo ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Clinical/Radiologic ', ' Non-Malignant ', ' nonmalignant ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Operating System ', ' preclinical study ', ' pre-clinical study ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' cancer imaging ', ' oncologic imaging ', ' oncology imaging ', ' tumor imaging ', ' head and neck cancer patient ', ' HNC patient ', ' frontier ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Implant ', ' user-friendly ', ' chemotherapy ', ' tumor ', ' patient population ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' Breast Cancer Patient ', ' Breast Tumor Patient ', ' inter-institutional ', ' clinical imaging ', ' clinical translation ', ' Lung infections ', ' pulmonary infections ', ' Patient imaging ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R01,2021,637830,TX-09
"Development of a Mobile Health Personalized Physiologic Analytics Tool for Pediatric Patients with Sepsis Project Summary  Sepsis, defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, encompasses a continuum that ranges from sepsis to severe sepsis, septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and eventually death if untreated. Sepsis is the leading cause of child mortality worldwide, with most of these deaths occurring in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) yet few clinical tools have been developed for identifying, monitoring, or managing septic children in LMICs. There is immense potential for novel clinical tools that can help clinicians more rapidly identify children with advanced stages of sepsis (severe sepsis, septic shock and MODS), who are at highest risk for decompensation and death. Mobile health (mHealth) tools, wearable devices, and artificial intelligence techniques have rapidly proliferated for a multitude of medical applications and could serve to bridge the gap in care of critically ill patients in LMIC settings. By enabling the detection of subtle physiologic changes indicating clinical deterioration, these tools may allow clinicians to intervene earlier, better direct care, and allocate scarce resources, all without the need for advanced laboratory diagnostics or critical care infrastructure. Furthermore, remote monitoring capabilities may also prove highly valuable in improving patient care and protecting the safety of healthcare workers during times of infectious disease outbreaks such as from novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).  This proposed research will develop a context-appropriate mHealth tool linking continuous physiologic data obtained from a wearable device with a novel machine learning approach known as personalized physiologic analytics (PPA) run on a standard smartphone to provide clinicians with accurate assessments of sepsis severity and mortality risk in septic children admitted to the Dhaka Hospital of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b). Formative research among clinicians at icddr,b will be used to develop this mHealth tool incorporating the PPA algorithm with a clinical decision support and alert system for use by front-line clinicians. Finally, the tool’s feasibility, usability, and accuracy for detection of sepsis severity and MODS will be validated in a new population of pediatric patients with sepsis.  Knowledge gained from this study will greatly advance the evidence base for the use of mHealth tools and artificial intelligence techniques to help clinicians worldwide better care for critically ill children in LMIC settings earlier in the course of their disease, thereby reducing morbidity and mortality from sepsis. The results of this investigational research will be used to inform a multi-center clinical trial which would seek to assess the impact of using this mHealth tool on clinical outcomes as well as the cost-effectiveness of this tool. This tool may also provide an effective means of assessing patient responses to various therapeutic interventions via continuous physiologic monitoring in future clinical trials. The proposed initiatives will also build a base of technical and professional expertise at icddr,b in mHealth research capacity and user-centered design. Project Narrative Worldwide, sepsis is responsible for the majority of deaths in children each year with most of these deaths occurring in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), yet few clinical tools have been developed for identifying, monitoring, or managing children with sepsis in LMICs. The proposed research will develop and validate a mobile health tool which links continuous physiologic data obtained remotely from a wearable device with a standard smartphone and machine learning approach known as personalized physiologic analytics to provide clinicians with accurate assessments of advanced stages of sepsis (severe sepsis, septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome), and risk of death in septic children without the need for laboratory diagnostics or expensive monitoring equipment.

"GeneRAlizable Sepsis Phenotyping (GRASP) using Electronic Health Records and Continuous Monitoring Sensors Abstract Sepsis, a heterogeneous syndrome characterized by whole-body inflammation caused by the body's response to an infection, is the most expensive and deadly condition treated in hospitals, with over 270,000 cases of sepsis-related deaths in the U.S. alone. Untreated sepsis may result in dilated and leaky blood vessels and severe hypotension requiring vasoactive medications (aka septic shock), and eventual injury to kidneys, lungs, and liver (aka organ injury) with mortality rates in excess of 40%. Successful prevention and management of sepsis, septic shock, and organ injury rely on the ability of clinicians to anticipate and estimate the risk, and administer the right life-saving treatments (e.g., antibiotics, fluids and vasopressors) at the right time. In recent years, data-driven modeling has been shown to enable early prediction of sepsis and to reveal clusters (or phenotypes) of sepsis, which may help with personalizing therapeutic interventions. However, crossing the translational chasm between clinical research and improving patient care also requires addressing 1) `data deserts' at different levels of care through better data integration, smarter lab ordering, and utilization of continuous monitoring wearable sensors; 2) interoperability and portability of clinical data and analytics; 3) principled dissemination and implementation studies; and 4) education of the next generation of caregivers to effectively utilize advanced analytical tools. The proposed research program builds upon PI's K01 early career development award focused on multicenter development and validation of sepsis predictive analytic algorithms (including hourly EHR data spanning ED and inpatient encounters from over 500,000 hospitalized patients across five district healthcare systems). Drawing insights from recent advances in domain adaptation and multi-task learning (sub-fields of machine learning), this project aims to discover generalizable dynamic phenotypes that are directly relevant to the prediction and management of sepsis, septic shock, and downstream organ injury. We propose to augment EHR-based analytics with high-resolution data from bedside devices (e.g., monitors, ventilators, dialysis, and IV pumps) and wearables (e.g., continuous blood pressure and lactate sensors) to address existing gaps in monitoring. Additionally, this program aims at advancing FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) and OMOP (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership) interoperability standards through the implementation of specific resources for high-resolution data sources. Finally, this research program will be conducted in close collaboration with our dissemination and implementation and hospital quality improvement teams to ensure early assessment of usability, barriers to implementation, and effective education to maximize the potential for clinical impact. Project Narrative The proposed project is making use of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and computers to collect and analyze data from hospitalized patients with sepsis. We plan to develop methods to identify patterns in the patient data which predict who is at risk for deterioration and which treatments they may benefit. We have a very strong team of doctors and researchers who work closely together, covering all aspects of the proposed research, which we hope will help us improve the care of hospitalized patients with sepsis.",GeneRAlizable Sepsis Phenotyping (GRASP) using Electronic Health Records and Continuous Monitoring Sensors,10277331,R35GM143121,"['Algorithms ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Computers ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Dialysis ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hypotension ', ' Low Blood Pressure ', ' Vascular Hypotensive Disorder ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' Inpatients ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Savings ', ' Septic Shock ', ' Syndrome ', ' Time ', ' Vasoconstrictor Agents ', ' Vasoactive Agonists ', ' Vasoconstrictor Drugs ', ' Vasoconstrictors ', ' Vasopressor Agents ', ' vasopressor ', ' Work ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Ventilator ', ' Caring ', ' Injury to Kidney ', ' kidney injury ', ' renal injury ', ' base ', ' Pump ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' Collaborations ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Pattern ', ' Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' portability ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' data integration ', ' next generation ', ' Sepsis ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' Outcome ', ' analytical tool ', ' interoperability ', ' usability ', ' personalized therapeutic ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' Data Analytics ', ' Internet of Things ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable biosensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' multi-task learning ', ' multitask learning ', ' Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources ', ' FHIR ', ' advanced analytics ', ' organ injury ', ' injury to organs ', ' Dissemination and Implementation ', ' implementation study ', ' ']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R35,2021,395000,CA-52
"Model Based Deep Learning Framework for Ultra-High Resolution Multi-Contrast MRI Sensitive imaging biomarkers are urgently needed for screening of high‐risk subjects, determine early disease progression, and assess response to therapies in neurodegenerative disorders. The atrophy of several brain regions is an established biomarker in AD, which strongly correlates with AD neuropathology. The accuracy of subfield volumes and cortical thickness estimated from current MRI methods is limited because of the vulnerability to motion, low spatial resolution, low contrast between brain sub‐structures, and dependence of current segmentation frameworks on image quality. Short motion‐compensated MRI protocols to map the human brain at high spatial resolution with multiple contrasts, along with accurate and computationally efficient segmentation algorithms, are urgently needed tor early detection and management of subjects with neurodegenerative disorders. We propose to introduce a 15‐minute motion‐robust 3‐D acquisition and reconstruction scheme to recover whole‐brain MRI data with 0.2 mm isotropic resolution with several different inversion times on 7T, along with segmentation algorithms that are robust to acceleration. The key difference of this framework from current approaches, which rely on MRI data 1 mm resolution, is the quite significant increase in spatial resolution to 0.2 mm as well as the availability of multiple conteasts. This improvement is enabled by innovations in all areas of the data‐processing pipeline, including acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis. These innovations are facilitated and integrated by the model based deep learning framework (MoDL); this framework facilitates the joint exploitation the available prior information, including motion and models for magnetization evolution, with convolutional neural network blocks that learn anatomical information from exemplar data. The successful completion of this framework will yield sensitive biomarkers, which will be considerably less expensive than PET and does not involve radiation exposure. As 7T clinical scanners become more common, this framework can emerge as a screening tool for high‐risk subjects (e.g. APOE, PSEN mutations) and assess progression in patients with short follow‐up duration. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is now a major public health concern with life expectancy at an all-time high. In US alone, the number of affected patients is expected to triple to 13.8 million by the year 2050. This proposal focuses on the development of an ultra-high resolution multicontrast MRI protocol, with the objective of improving the accuracy of brain atrophy rates in early AD subjects. The successful completion of this proposal will yield a biomarker that is sensitive to early brain changes in AD, which can facilitate early detection in high risk population, measure progression, and quantify the efficacy of brain sparing drugs.",Model Based Deep Learning Framework for Ultra-High Resolution Multi-Contrast MRI,10120861,R01AG067078,"['Acceleration ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', '

"Development and Validation of Radiation-Free Pediatric Renal Function Quantification Project Abstract Motivation: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than 500 million people. Children commonly develop CKD from urinary obstructive diseases and nephrotoxic therapies, and then suffer severe growth failure,  hypertension, cardiovascular risks, and neurocognitive deficits, and eventually end-stage kidney disease. Accurate renal function quantification will improve clinical management of hydronephrosis (1 in 100 babies) and  dosing/selection of chemotherapeutic regimens in oncology patients. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the biomarker of renal function, is derived from blood or urine tests. These tests only provide global GFR and are limited in accuracy, especially in children, and even more so in children with cancer. MRI offers superb anatomic delineation without ionizing radiation, and is thus ideal for pediatric kidney imaging. However, MRI has not been widely adopted for pediatric renal function evaluation due to lack of reliability and cumbersome workflow. These hurdles stem from the fact that the critical components required for global and regional GFR calculation, including high spatiotemporal resolution, plasma flow and arterial input function, are difficult to obtain, and that accurate image segmentation of kidneys (cortex and medulla) is labor intensive. Additionally, although the same contrast agent injection can be used for obstruction evaluation, certain areas of the kidney suffer from significant signal loss using standard MRI acquisition techniques due to high contrast agent concentrations. This project addresses these major challenges for automated comprehensive renal function evaluation in children. Approach: The project has three development aims, which are validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable novel free-breathing time-resolved 3D dynamic contrast enhanced MRI that simultaneously provides accurate GFR calculation and renal plasma flow. This is achieved by incorporating self-navigated motion compensation, fast acquisition with parallel imaging and compressed sensing, and phase-contrast flow imaging. The second aim is to develop multiple new image analysis methods to extract GFR and renal plasma flow (RPF) that  leverage novel flow data of Aim 1, as well as automated new machine-learning image processing techniques for the segmentation of kidneys and ultimately global and regional GFR calculation. In Aim 3, we will develop and integrate ultrashort-echo-time techniques to address the MRI signal loss due to T2* effects from high contrast concentration for patients with obstruction, and further incorporate motion compensation and accelerated  imaging methods to enable time-resolved high-resolution dynamic MRI for contrast washout kinetics analysis in the same MR exam. Aim 4 will determine the performance of these methods in a clinical setting. Significance: This work will lead to robust, automated comprehensive pediatric renal MRI for safer and more accurate renal function evaluation in children. The techniques will facilitate widespread application in the com- munity setting and permit robust evaluation of renal function, for both children and adults. Project Narrative Kidney diseases in children often stem from blockages of the urinary tract or toxicity from medications, such as antibiotics or chemotherapies.

"Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission for High Resolution Neuroimaging at 7T Project Summary The goal of this project is to develop a framework for high-performance parallel transmission (pTx) that is trans- ferable to a wide range of MRI scanners, and apply it to push the spatial encoding limits of echo planar imaging (EPI) at 7 Tesla. EPI is by far the most widely used pulse sequence for rapid functional, diffusion, and perfusion imaging, and has been the focus of considerable development in recent years to increase its speed and spatial resolution. Now there is a strong desire to push EPI's spatial resolution down to the micro scale. For functional MRI (fMRI), this would enable imaging of ﬁne structures (layers, columns, and nuclei) of cortical and subcortical architecture while better resolving the hemodynamic response. For diffusion MRI (dMRI), micro scale EPI would improve surface and laminar analysis of ﬁbers in the cortex, as well as brain parcelation using fractional anisotropy differences between gray matter regions, while broadly reducing partial volume effects. It would further enable EPI to be broadly applied to accelerate anatomic scans that are geometrically matched to fMRI and dMRI scans. However, increasing the resolution of single-shot EPI requires longer readouts which extend echo times and re- duce functional contrast in fMRI and signal-to-noise in dMRI at 7 Tesla, while increasing geometric distortions and blurring. Segmented or multishot EPI is a classic method to increase spatial resolution without increasing readout durations, but is underutilized, primarily due to its high sensitivity to motion and dynamic phase changes between shots which cause large image artifacts.  We propose to develop a new multishot EPI technique called shuttered EPI, which addresses the lim- itations of conventional multishot EPI by imaging a set of spatially disjoint shutters in each shot. The shutters are produced by a multidimensional excitation pulse and are spatially shifted between shots to cover an entire slice. However, with thin slices the length of the excitation pulses are impractical (20-100 ms). Many-coil pTx (> 8 coils) can shorten the length of these pulses to feasible durations, but current 7 Tesla scanners have only 8 transmit channels due to cost, footprint, cabling, and other constraints. In the ﬁrst project period we pioneered a technique called array-compressed pTx (acpTx) which overcomes this limitation. Using acpTx, 8 transmit chan- nels can control an arbitrarily large number of coils, where the channels and coils are connected via an array compression network that is optimized with RF pulses for speciﬁc excitations. In this project, we will develop and apply acpTx methods and hardware (a many-coil head transmit array and an 8 channel-to-many coil array com- pression network) to achieve feasible RF pulse durations when exciting the shutter patterns required for shuttered EPI. These developments will be implemented on two major 7T scanner platforms and evaluated in submillimeter (600 micron) fMRI and dMRI acquisitions. Overall, the project encompasses the synergistic design of RF pulses, hardware, acquisitions and reconstructions to achieve a major advance in spatial encoding. Project Narrative Diffusion and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 7 Tesla ﬁeld strength using echo planar imaging (EPI) has the potential to deliver clear images of brain structure and function at the level of layers, columns, and nuclei. However, when existing EPI scans are pushed to the spatial resolutions required to resolve these structures, they become highly sensitive to off resonance-induced geometric distortions, relaxation-induced blur- ring, physiological noise and motion. To address this problem, in this project we will develop many-coil array- compressed parallel transmission and apply it to enable shuttered multishot EPI scans that are robust to these effects.",Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission for High Resolution Neuroimaging at 7T,10093035,R01EB016695,"['Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Diffusion ', ' Elements ', ' Goals ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Head ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Image Enhancement ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Problem Formulations ', ' Relaxation ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Time ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Anisotropy ', ' Echo-Planar Imaging ', ' Echo-Planar Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Echoplanar Imaging ', ' Echoplanar Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Planar Medical Imaging ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Surface ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Fiber ', ' Measurement ', ' Homebound Persons ', ' Home-Bound Persons ', ' House-Bound Persons ', ' Shut-In ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' magnetic field ', ' Performance ', ' phase change ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' response ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI Scans ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Slice ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' blood oxygen level dependent ', ' blood oxygenation level dependent ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' reconstruction ', ' time use ', ' virtual ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' spectroscopic imaging ', ' imaging spectroscopy ', ' motion sensitivity ', ' perfusion imaging ', ' ']",NIBIB,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,558172,TN-05
"The Development of Individual Differences in Adolescent Brain Structure and Risk Rescuing Missed Longitudinal MRI visits in the UNC Early Brain Development Studies Database PROJECT ABSTRACT  In our ongoing R01 (MH123747-01A1) “The Development of Individual Differences in Adolescent Brain Structure and Risk”) project, we aim to characterize the portion of individual differences in brain structure in the early adolescent brain is already present in the earlier years of life. Early adolescence and puberty is a major period of postnatal brain development, characterized by dynamic structural and functional brain maturation and reorganization, and emerging risk for psychiatric disorders, though it is not known how this period of development contributes to individual differences in brain structure and risk. The UNC Early Brain Development Study (EBDS) is a unique and innovative longitudinal study that has followed children, enrolled prenatally, with imaging and cognitive/behavioral assessments at birth, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 years. 482 children from this cohort are now reaching adolescence, and we are following these children at 12, 14, and 16 years of age via MRI, cognitive and behavioral assessments, with a focus on the phenotypes of executive function, attention, and anxiety, consistent with RDoC constructs important for psychiatric disorder risk. One particular aim is to investigate the use of machine learning (ML) for the predictive analysis of early brain development to cognitive and behavioral outcomes in adolescence and to risk for subsequent psychiatric disorders. Yet, most machine learning (ML) algorithms applied to longitudinal data do not perform well (or at all) when data points are missing, as ML methods need both complete data and large sample sizes. As longitudinal studies suffer commonly from significant missing data at different time points due to acquisition failure as well as participant attrition, even a rich database like the UNC EBDS is reduced to a significantly lower sample size by selecting only complete datasets to apply predictive ML (less than a third of the datasets of EBDS data from age 1 – 10 years is complete).  Here, we propose to rescue missing EBDS timepoints (at ages 1 - 10 yrs) of structural MR image data via multi-modal, multi-timepoints image predictions. This image data imputation includes cross-modality image generation (generating missing MRI data from existing MRI data at the same time), where available, as well as multi-timepoints imputation of longitudinal data (generating missing MRI data from existing MRI data at different time points). We will then apply our out-of-distribution model to provide additional information on the appropriateness of the imputed data. Subsequently, the same image processing that was applied to the original EBDS MRI data will be applied to the imputed/generated MRI data to compute missing information of morphometric measures (regional volumes, cortical thickness, surface area, and white matter fiber tract properties). This imputed data will be a highly significant resource for longitudinal ML/AI studies of brain development performed on the EBDS dataset, as it would allow for an increase in training data of over 200%. The original MR images, the imputed MR images, and the morphometric measures will all be shared via NDA, alongside the trained imputation network for use by others. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Studies of brain development suffer commonly from missing data due to acquisition failure as well as participant attrition. This missing data severely impact machine learning algorithms as they need both complete data and large sample sizes. Here, we will rescue missing data via advanced image data generation for the UNC Early Brain Development Study so that machine learning algorithms can be applied to study how early brain development predicts cognition and behavior later in adolescence, as well as risk for psychiatric disorders.",The Development of Individual Differences in Adolescent Brain Structure and Risk,10412438,R01MH123747,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Cognition ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Phenotype ', ' Puberty ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Time ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Training ', ' Fiber ', ' Failure ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Sample Size ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Visit ', ' visual processing ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' Participant ', ' Study Subject ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' 10 year old ', ' 10 years of age ', ' age 10 years ', ' ten year old ', ' ten years of age ', ' 16 year old ', ' 16 years of age ', ' age 16 years ', ' sixteen year old ', ' sixteen years of age ', ' Network-based ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' early adolescence ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' data archive ', ' data library ', ' predictive test ', ' predictive assay ', ' postnatal period ', ' post-natal period ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' detection method ', ' detection procedure ', ' detection technique ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,286650,NC-04
"Sepsis phenotypes at risk for infections caused by multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacilli: elucidating the impact of sepsis definition and patient case mix on prediction performance SUPPLEMENT ABSTRACT Sepsis is a devastating syndrome that represents a leading cause of death, morbidity, and healthcare costs. Its impact is amplified by rising rates of antimicrobial resistance. Improving sepsis outcomes primarily results from prescribing timely antibiotics based on the estimated risk of multidrug resistance (MDR). Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are data- driven approaches looking for patterns in massive datasets. While the AI/ ML algorithms rapidly advanced and built successful imaging processing applications, the promise of AI/ML in sepsis and antimicrobial resistance research remains largely unfulfilled. The main reasons stem from deficient, inaccessible and poorly labeled clinical data allowing for only a small portion of the electronic health records (EHR) data to be used. More so, clinical narratives such as notes and imaging reports which contain unstructured data elements in free text format are almost never used. Our parent K08 award aims to identify sepsis phenotypes at risk for MDR GNB that will enable better antibiotic prescribing practices and standardize comparisons across hospitals. We propose to accomplish our goal by leveraging big data and using innovative methods such as ML methods. This supplement will strengthen our project by analyzing in detail the barriers to efficiently using EHR data including unstructured data elements and providing data engineering solutions. The objective is to provide the framework for ML use in sepsis research. Demonstrating reproducibility and rigor of our ML methods and making the algorithms and datasets accessible per FAIR and TRUST principles will be responsive to NIGMS and broader NIH priorities. Our aims reflect these priorities: 1) Analyze barriers to use of EHR structured data and provide data engineering solutions for data enrichment, 2) Extract and assess the importance of unstructured data in developing ML sepsis models, and 3) Compare the ML sepsis models using unstructured and structured data VS structured data only and ensure algorithm fairness by testing it across subgroups of interest based on gender and race. We will incorporate clinical data from the 15 hospitals in our healthcare system serving an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse patient population in rural, suburban and urban hospitals. Dr. Vazquez Guillamet has training in Infectious Diseases and Critical Care Medicine and experience in sepsis research. This supplement complements and broadens the initial K08 award. It serves as the natural next step in deepening her expertise in innovative methods. This supplement will provide the opportunity for meaningful collaborations with data scientists with ample expertise in unstructured data methods and data engineers specialized in ML methods. It will help Dr. Vazquez Guillamet to promote clinically applicable algorithms for challenging problems such as sepsis treatment. For this supplement, Dr. Vazquez Guillamet will continue the collaboration with her multidisciplinary team of mentors and add data engineering support. An accredited course in unsupervised machine learning will be added to her career development plan. She will continue her path to becoming an analytics translator at the intersection of clinical medicine and clinical applied informatics. The fertile research environment at Washington University in St. Louis with focus on data availability, the experienced mentorship team now incorporating data engineering expertise and a well-crafted career development plan will enable Dr. Vazquez Guillamet to achieve her long-term goal of becoming an independently funded clinician-investigator utilizing big data to develop applications for risk prediction, surveillance, and outcome comparisons in sepsis and antimicrobial resistance. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sepsis and antimicrobial resistance are critical issues. The parent K08 of Dr. Vazquez Guillamet aims to identify sepsis phenotypes at risk for MDR GNB by using mathematical models and machine learning (ML) methods. The proposed supplement expands her initial proposal by 1) analyzing barriers to efficient use of electronic health records (EHR) structured data and proposing data engineering solutions for data enrichment, 2) assessing the relevance of unstructured data extraction, and 3) ensuring algorithm fairness by comparing the model’s performance across gender and race subgroups. The candidate, Dr. Vazquez Guillamet has continued to focus on innovative ways to assess sepsis outcomes and to advance as an analytics translator. The current proposal broadens her parent K08 and it will build the framework for ML research in sepsis by providing a shareable, robust and standardized dataset, data dictionary and computational steps.",Sepsis phenotypes at risk for infections caused by multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacilli: elucidating the impact of sepsis definition and patient case mix on prediction performance,10412800,K08GM140310,"['Accreditation ', ' Algorithms ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Award ', ' Bacillus ', ' Case Mixes ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' Cognition ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Critical Care ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environment ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Ethnic People ', ' Ethnic Population ', ' Ethnicity People ', ' Ethnicity Population ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Hospitals ', ' Urban Hospitals ', ' City Hospitals ', ' Metropolitan Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infection ', ' Laboratories ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Minority People ', ' Minority Population ', ' Morbidity -

"Non-invasive Evaluation of Intracranial Atherosclerotic Disease Using Hemodynamic Biomarkers The proposed study will be based on a multimodal approach using 4D flow MRI, perfusion-weighted MRI (PWI), diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) and high-resolution vessel wall imaging (VWI) together with patient information (demographics and clinical factors) to predict the risk of recurrent stroke of patients with intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) stenosis. This will allow integrating the vulnerability of the stenosis as well as the patient by assessing the hemodynamic impact, plaque stability, and stroke lesion pattern together with patient information into a prediction model. PWI will provide tissue perfusion, VWI will provide plaque stability, DWI will provide stroke lesion pattern and 4D flow MRI will provide macroscopic hemodynamics of the circle of Willis (CoW). We will concentrate on the following innovative developments: 4D flow MRI: In order to allow 4D flow MRI scanning with a high dynamic velocity range (necessary to measure slow and fast velocities simultaneously), we recently developed dual-venc 4D flow MRI. However, this method suffers from extended scan tome of an already long acquisition. We, therefore, aim to minimize scan time for dual-venc 4D flow MRI scan while using the required spatial resolution and volume coverage, targeting 5-10 minutes so that this sequence can be added to clinical protocols. We aim to achieve this by integrating compressed sensing acceleration. Rigorous testing of the sequence will be done in phantom experiments as well as in a healthy test-retest control study. Data Analysis and Outcome Prediction: Currently, the multi-modal information that can be acquired with MRI has not been combined and used for comprehensive prediction of recurrent stroke risk in ICAD. Information that can be acquired from different MRI modalities may be critical in characterizing ICAD patient status. We will develop a new analysis tool that combines all data into a single network graph. All imaging data will be reported relative to supplying the intracranial artery of the CoW by using the vascular territory region of interest analysis. This will allow gathering all imaging parameters in a network graph. In a cross-sectional patient study, we will use combined data to see if it enables differentiation between healthy subjects, ICAD subgroups. Patient Study: In Aim 3, we will develop a machine-learning algorithm to predict which of the patients are at risk of experiencing a recurrent stroke. In order to achieve this, we will enroll a total of 150 ICAD patients from two institutions (Northwestern Memorial Hospital and San Francisco General Hospital). The combined data from the four different MR modalities and all other patient information will be used to identify only the discriminative features. This will be realized by using support vector machine recursive feature elimination to rank features associated with the risk of an ischemic event. The SVM will be trained and tested using information from the patient's clinical follow-up as outcome measure. The outcome (ischemic event or death yes/no)) will enable the development of the SVM classifier to predict outcome. Project Narrative (2 – 3 sentences) In the proposed study, we will develop an advanced intracranial MRI protocol together with a comprehensive image processing pipeline allowing full characterization of intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD). Imaging biomarkers together with clinical and demographic factors will enable the identification of patients at risk to suffer recurring stroke. Machine learning methods will be used to predict risk. Successful completion will allow for better identification of patients who could benefit from endovascular stenting to reduce stroke recurrence.",Non-invasive Evaluation of Intracranial

"Advanced Image Analysis Tools for Super-Resolved MRI in Small Animals SUMMARY Imaging in animal models plays a key role in biomedical research, enabling both foundational studies for understanding disease processes, as well as translational studies evaluating novel therapies. In vivo imaging, in particular, offers the benefits of minimal harm to the animal and opportunities for measuring developmental, longitudinal changes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most extensively used in vivo imaging modalities because of its excellent sensitivity to a multitude of biological parameters and flexibility with different animal models, such as rodents, ferrets, and non-human primates. MRI has been used not only to advance understanding of neurodegenerative diseases, but also aging, cancer, addiction, and cardiovascular disorders. However, despite the research community’s desire for emulating clinical trials and performing high-throughput studies, automated analysis of MRI in animal models has significantly lagged state-of-the-art tools that are available in the analysis of human imaging. A major reason is that most animal MRI acquisitions are two- dimensional with high in-plane resolution but thick slices, whereas the most powerful image analysis tools work best on isotropic acquisitions. As a result, many researchers have been resigned to performing analyses involving laborious, manual delineations. Our team has recently developed a novel algorithm that uses deep learning to extract isotropic spatial resolution from a standard anisotropic MRI acquisition possessing without the need for external high-resolution training data, which is typically unavailable and difficult to procure. The ability to retrospectively recover isotropic spatial resolution from these two-dimensional MRI acquisitions allows for significantly reduced costs compared to high- resolution isotropic acquisitions. Moreover, it opens up the possibilities for more advanced analyses by enabling key image processing algorithms, such as registration and segmentation, to be more accurately performed and with greater automation. We therefore propose to perform the following Specific Aims in this R21 application: 1) Optimize and evaluate our deep learning-based unsupervised super-resolution approach for animal MRI; 2) Develop and evaluate a super-resolution algorithm for higher-dimensional data; 3) Publicly release the developed tools. Our overarching hypothesis is that the provided tools will enable significantly more sensitive imaging biomarkers, thereby increasing statistical power and reducing the size and cost of animal studies. The combination of the proposed resolution enhancement with state-of-the-art techniques for image analysis will also increase reproducibility by obviating the need for laborious, and potentially inconsistent manual delineations. Furthermore, these efforts will enable both pre-clinical and clinical trials to be implemented with nearly identical analysis pipelines. This application is being submitted in response to PAR 19-369, “Development of Animal Models and Related Biological Materials for Research.” NARRATIVE Animal models are critical for developing new therapies and improving the understanding of a wide variety of diseases such as cancer, traumatic brain injury, and Alzheimer’s disease. Although magnetic resonance imaging enables monitoring of disease progression in animals, computational tools for extracting imaging biomarkers have lagged behind state-of-the-art tools available for clinical data, often because of limitations in spatial resolution. This project will develop and publicly release novel tools for improving the spatial resolution in animal images, leading to more robust, automated image analyses that will improve translation of animal studies to humans.",Advanced Image Analysis Tools for Super-Resolved MRI in Small Animals,10303505,R21OD030163,"['Adoption ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Animals ', ' Automation ', ' Biocompatible Materials ', ' Biomaterials ', ' biological material ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Feedback ', ' Ferrets ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Manuals ', ' Masks ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Pathology ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' Disease Progression ', ' tool ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' interest ', ' Brain scan ', ' cardiac imaging ', ' cardiac scanning ', ' heart scanning ', ' heart imaging ', ' human data ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' validation studies ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Data ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Device ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Slice ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' cost ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' translational study ', ' Four-dimensional ', ' 4-dimensional ', ' two-dimensional ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' usability ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' animal model development ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' cancer addiction ', ' Algorithmic Analysis ', ' Algorithmic Analyses ', ' Analyses of Algorithms ', ' Analysis of Algorithms ', ' in vivo imaging ', ' imaging in vivo ', ' 4D MRI ', ' 4-D MR imaging ', ' 4-D MRI ', ' 4-D flow MR imaging ', ' 4-D flow MRI ', ' 4-D flow imaging ', ' 4-D flow magnetic resonance imaging ', ' 4-D magnetic resonance imaging ', ' 4D MR imaging ', ' 4D flow MR imaging ', ' 4D flow MRI ', ' 4D flow imaging ', ' 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging ', ' 4D magnetic resonance imaging ', ' four dimensional MR imaging ', ' four dimensional MRI ', ' four dimensional flow ', ' four dimensional magnetic resonance imaging ', ' diffusion weighted ', ' animal imaging ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' preclinical trial ', ' pre-clinical trial ', ' human imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' automated image analysis ', ' multidimensional data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' analysis pipeline ', ' automated analysis ', ' ']",OD,HENRY M.

"Diagnosis of indeterminate brain lesions using MRI-based machine learning and polygenic risk models PROJECT SUMMARY In 2017 an MRI was performed at a rate of over one for every 10 US residents. The majority of these were brain MRIs. Indeterminate mass lesions are present on over 1% of brain MRIs in individuals over 45 years old. Misinterpretation of brain MRI can lead to significant iatrogenic morbidity and mortality. For example, tumefactive Central Nervous System Inflammatory Demyelinating Disease (CNSIDD) is commonly misdiagnosed as a malignancy, even following pathological review. This results in inappropriate brain biopsies, debulking and radiation. While early tumor resection is associated with favorable outcome in patients with high- grade glioma, observation, biopsy at an alternate site or nonsurgical options are often more appropriate for other indeterminate mass lesions that can encompass low-grade primary brain tumor, CNSIDD, CNS lymphoma and brain metastasis. Thus, to prevent iatrogenic morbidity, there is a critical need for scalable and reproducible methods to distinguish CNSIDD from other brain lesions, and to accurately diagnose brain tumors prior to biopsy. We recently published a polygenic risk model demonstrating that the 25 known glioma germline risk variants can estimate absolute and lifetime glioma risk. The clinical significance of these models is driven by germline variants that are associated with >4-fold increased risk of glioma. We have also shown that the same 25 germline variants can predict glioma molecular subtype. As a complementary approach, we have shown that imaging characteristics differ across glioma, CNSIDD, CNS lymphoma and brain metastases. We have successfully utilized MRI-based machine learning to predict the molecular subtype in high-grade glioma. We hypothesize that both germline genotyping and MRI-based machine learning provide an opportunity to diagnose indeterminate mass lesions as well as predict glioma molecular subtype prior to surgery and thus personalized treatment. The project has the following three aims: Aim 1: Develop and validate a MRI-based machine learning model to differentiate adult diffuse glioma from tumefactive CNSIDD, CNS lymphoma and solitary brain metastases of unknown primary. Aim 2: Evaluate sensitivity and specificity of the polygenic glioma risk model to differentiate adult diffuse glioma from tumefactive CNSIDD, CNS lymphoma and solitary brain metastases. Aim 3: Integrate the polygenic glioma subtype model and MRI-based machine learning model to predict adult diffuse glioma molecular subtype and validate the integrated model using a prospective cohort. The proposed project will further enhance the care of patients by determining if an early MRI lesion is actually a glioma. Early definitive surgery in these patients could be curative.

"Pooled analysis of multiple sclerosis findings on multi-site 7 Tesla MRI Project Summary/Abstract Background: Although current MRI performs well as a tool to measure white matter (WM) inflammation in MS, its ability to quantify gray matter (GM) pathology, meningeal inflammation, and chronic inflammatory changes are limited. For this reason, researchers have looked to 7-tesla (7T) MRI for more robust in vivo measures of pathology. Although the increased sensitivity of 7T MRI for these aspects of MS have stimulated much interest, the impact of previous studies have been limited due to small sample sizes, varying methodologies, cumbersome analysis methods, and conflicting results – all of which have limited the generalizability of findings and more widespread dissemination of the use of this tool. Objective: In this study, we aim to advance the use of 7T MRI as a tool for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment effect monitoring by performing multi-site, large sample size evaluation of imaging correlates of cortical and deep GM lesions, chronic active WM lesions (WM lesions with paramagnetic rims on MRI), and meningeal inflammation (leptomeningeal inflammation (LME) on MRI) and validation of their clinical relevance. We also will look develop automated tools for identification and quantification of these findings on 7T MRI. Study Design: Imaging and clinical data will be derived from previous and ongoing studies of the use of 7T MRI in MS performed at multiple collaborative sites under the umbrella of the North American Imaging in MS (NAIMS) Collaborative, including the University of Maryland, Baltimore, Harvard-Brigham and Women’s Hospital, the National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the University of Pennsylvania, and the Montreal Neurological Institute at McGill University. This includes data on up to 814 individual persons with MS, 1232 individual study visits, and a follow up period of up to 5 years. GM lesions, WM lesions with paramagnetic rims, and LME will be identified on 7T, with critical evaluation of methods and their relationship to clinical data. Further, the manual analysis results will be used as training sets for deep learning algorithms for identification of these abnormalities on future 7T MRI scans. Impact: This study would provide the data on measurement variability and generalizable clinical importance of the imaging findings being investigated, along with providing automated tools for future, high-throughput studies. In advancing these precise measures of aspects of MS pathology only poorly measured on lower field MRI, this study will lead to more accurate MS diagnoses, improvements in the ability to monitor changes in MS pathology over time, and perhaps lead to the screening of new pharmaceutical interventions to target GM lesions, WM lesions with paramagnetic rims, and LME. Project Narrative In this study, multiple institutions performing research using 7-tesla (7T) MRI research on patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) will combine data for a large scale, pooled analysis project. The investigators will refine methods for visualizing cortical and deep gray matter lesions, chronically inflamed white matter lesions, and meningeal inflammation on 7T MRI in MS and will evaluate their clinical relevance on a large scale and develop machine learning algorithms for future identification. It is expected that validating findings on 7T and their clinical relevance along with providing automated tools for analysis will lead to the use of 7T MRI as a more widespread clinical tool, resulting in earlier diagnoses, better prognostication, and more effective treatment monitoring in MS.",Pooled analysis of multiple sclerosis findings on multi-site 7 Tesla MRI,10278178,R01NS122980,"['Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Baltimore ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Demyelinations ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inflammation ', ' Institutes ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Maryland ', ' Masks ', ' Meninges ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Multiple Sclerosis ', ' Disseminated Sclerosis ', ' insular sclerosis ', ' Persons ', ' Pathology ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Standardization ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' physically handicapped ', ' physical disability ', ' physically disabled ', ' Caring ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Inflammatory ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Meningeal ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' magnetic field ', ' American ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Histopathology ', ' Structure ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Devices ', ' high throughput analysis ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI Scans ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Institution ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ', ' NINDS ', ' National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke ', ' Multiple Sclerosis Lesions ', ' MS Lesions ', ' Outcome ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Consumption ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' treatment effect ', ' comparative ', ' clinical care ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' screening ', ' Algorithmic Analysis ', ' Algorithmic Analyses ', ' Analyses of Algorithms ', ' Analysis of Algorithms ', ' cognitive disability ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' prognostic tool ', ' multiple sclerosis patient ', ' MS patient ', ' patients with MS ', ' patients with multiple sclerosis ', ' imaging study ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' Visualization ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2021,535821,MD-07
"Enhancing Quality in Pediatrics Sepsis with Shock Prediction and Early Electronic Decision Support (EQUIP with SPEED) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Pediatric septic shock is a leading cause of childhood death, in which morbidity-free survival depends on timely diagnosis and treatment. Although the medical community, general public and state legislatures have increasingly recognized that delays in diagnosing septic shock in children are an important cause of preventable morbidity, there are no validated predictive models to improve early sepsis diagnosis in children. The candidate, Dr. Halden Scott, is a pediatric emergency physician at Children's Hospital Colorado and the University of Colorado School of Medicine. She has critically evaluated early diagnostic strategies in an Electronic Health Record (EHR)-derived pediatric sepsis registry that she designed that will support the proposed research. She is seeking to develop into an independent health services researcher, through the proposed mentored research with the following goals: 1) Derive and test models to predict septic shock in an existing EHR-derived dataset, comparing models derived with two modern modeling techniques; 2) create an EHR decision support tool for the early recognition of septic shock; 3) conduct a pilot implementation trial of decision support in community and academic pediatric emergency care settings within the Children's Hospital Colorado network. This implementation and feasibility data will inform a future multicenter pragmatic trial of computerized decision support in diagnosis of pediatric septic shock, which Dr. Scott will propose in an R01 application before the end of the K award. Dr. Scott's research trajectory is facilitated and enriched by strong institutional clinical, informatics and administrative support, and her involvement in the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network and international sepsis guidelines committees.  This award would support Dr. Scott's career development goals: acquire skills in predictive modeling, the use of health information technology in learning health systems, and pragmatic trials. Dr. Scott's nationally renowned mentors will support these goals: Dr. Kempe, expert in pragmatic trials, program evaluation and implementation research; Dr. Fairclough, expert in statistics and modeling; Dr. Kahn, expert in research and clinical informatics. Additional advisors contribute expertise in machine learning, clinical pediatric emergency research, critical care and sepsis. This proposal responds to AHRQ priorities: improving health care quality through information systems, improving safety and quality by synthesizing evidence, and focuses on AHRQ priority populations including children and those with chronic care needs. The research, mentorship and training plan proposed are ideally suited to provide Dr. Scott with the skills needed to develop into an independent health services researcher focused on improving the quality of care for pediatric emergency conditions, particularly sepsis, through the use of health information technology in learning health systems, and conduct of pragmatic trials to test implementation of evidence-based practice in emergency settings. Project Narrative / Public Health Relevance  Pediatric septic shock, a leading cause of childhood death, is often recognized late, causing preventable morbidity, and improved early diagnostic approaches would improve the timeliness of sepsis diagnosis, accelerate treatment and improve outcomes.

"Sepsis online: learning while doing to understand biology and treatment PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT More than 1 million Americans are hospitalized with sepsis each year, and nearly one in five don’t survive. Most efforts to reduce sepsis deaths begin with the premise that patients are largely similar, and that ether moving treatment earlier or targeting therapeutics to a single mechanism will improve outcomes. In prior work funded by a NIGMS R35 award, we derived sepsis endotypes using a suite of machine learning methods inside the electronic health records (EHR) in a large integrated health system. These endotypes differed in biology, outcomes, and treatment response, and were reproduced in thousands of patients. But how will they lead to precision care? In this Renewal, we will leverage our clinical translational laboratory and remnant blood collection to better understand the biology of sepsis endotypes and explore new domains related to pathogen, microbiome, and molecular mechanisms. We will use Bayesian causal networks and reinforcement learning to optimize treatment policies over endotypes in more than 10 million EHR encounters. Finally, we will move learning online and embed endotypes inside the EHR at the point-of-care. These steps will take the science of sepsis endotypes and inform clinical decisions made under time pressure and uncertainty. By testing endotype treatment policies at the “live-edge”, we will strengthen causal inference, mechanistic insight, and learn while doing. My program will be supervised by external advisory boards with expertise in machine learning, inflammation, immunology, computational and systems biology, causal methods, artificial intelligence, and health information technology. This work will further develop my clinical-translational laboratory and cross-cutting mentorship of junior scientists. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sepsis endotypes are biological subtypes defined by distinct pathophysiologic mechanisms and identified by corresponding biomarkers. Endotypes may respond differently to sepsis treatment. Moving the science of sepsis endotypes from offline to online learning in the electronic health record has the potential to broaden our understanding of sepsis biology, improve causal inference, and advance precision care.",Sepsis online: learning while doing to understand biology and treatment,10169130,R35GM119519,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Award ', ' Biology ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' E-learning ', ' computer-assisted instruction ', ' computer-based education ', ' computer-based instruction ', ' computer-based learning ', ' computer-based training ', ' digital education ', ' digital learning ', ' eLearning ', ' electronic learning ', ' internet-assisted education ', ' internet-based training ', ' multimedia learning ', ' on-line education ', ' on-line learning ', ' online education ', ' online learning ', ' technology-enhanced learning ', ' virtual learning ', ' web-based instruction ', ' web-based training ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Ethers ', ' Inflammation ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' pressure ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Science ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Immunology ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' insight ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Integrated Health Care Systems ', ' integrated health system ', ' integrated healthcare systems ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' computer biology ', ' Computational Biology ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' American ', ' Systems Biology ', ' NIGMS ', ' National Institute of General Medical Sciences ', ' Collection ', ' Molecular ', ' point of care ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' microbiome ', ' Sepsis ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' Outcome ', ' pathogen ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' health information technology ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' personalized care ', ' Precision care ', ' individualized care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' improved outcome ', ' treatment optimization ', ' therapy optimization ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R35,2021,483099,PA-18
"Multi-Site Clinical Data to Power MRI Biomarker of Neonatal Brain Injury Abstract This project aims to release our recently gathered existing clinically-acquired data for neonatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). HIE affects 1-5/1000 term-born neonates and is a major cause of early-childhood mortality and morbidity. Neonatal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is acquired routinely for the clinical care of HIE. Neonatal brain MRI is expected to reveal 3D neuroanatomic mechanisms of adverse outcomes so that we can design new treatments specifically target those mechanisms. Neonatal brain MRI also carries hope to identify those neonates who are at risk to develop adverse outcomes later in life, so that early intervention program can target those at-risk neonates for maximum benefit. Despite MRI's vital role in caring for HIE, the current norm in clinical practice is to read MRI visually by expert neuroradiologist or neurologist. Expert reads, however, has many limitations – subjective, qualitative, insufficient to reveal mechanisms, and inadequate to predict outcomes. Objective and quantitative analysis of MRI is possible with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical and neuroimaging informatics. A major limitation, however, is the lack of publicly-available data on HIE. Our project aims to fill this gap, by archiving and releasing our clinically-acquired, large-scale (N=231), and multi-site (2 hospitals) data on HIE. Our data was acquired partly funded by NIH R01 (2012-2017) and foundations (2016-2020). Our data is comprehensive, including clinical data elements (from both mothers and neonates), neonatal brain MRI (structural and diffusion sequences), expert-consensus annotation of lesion regions in neonatal brain MRI, NICU outcome (death/survival, length of stay), and 2-year-old neurocognitive outcomes (normal/adverse, yes/no for development dealy, yes/no for the hearing/visual/motor impairment, and yes/no for cerebral palsy). Our data is also representative, coming from patients with different racial/ethnicity groups, in patients with a wide range of outcomes, from different MRI scanners (Siemens 3T or GE 1.5T), with different imaging protocols, and MRI scanned on different days of life. We will also derive new data from existing data. The anonymized (de-identified) data will be released to the NCBI dbGaP platform with the “Controlled Access” option, requiring IRB and data use agreement (DUA). The derived data will be released to dbGaP with the “Open Access” option, freely downloadable without any approval. Both release options are consistent with other clinical and MRI data that have already been released on dbGaP. We hope this first comprehensive data will boost future collaborative efforts for AI to automatically identify HIE lesions in MRI, and for AI to accurately predict HIE outcome integrating clinical and MRI information. Project Narrative We aim to publicly release our existing clinically-acquired data for neonatal brain injury caused by hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE).

"Ultrasound-based sensors for the fusion and motion correction of MRI and PET/CT data Project summary Radiology departments are equipped with many different types of medical imaging scanners, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Computed Tomography (CT), X-ray, ultrasound imaging (USI) and Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT), among others. Clearly, none of these modalities is ideal; otherwise, there would be no rationale for anybody to purchase any others. Each modality is characterized by its own contrast mechanism and provides its own type of information.  An ideal scanner might be defined here as one that could provide any of these contrasts, whose hardware would include that required for all of the main scanning techniques, whereby one could simply select the desired scan type, e.g., MRI+CT+USI, and proceed. Clearly, in practice, such an ideal scanner would be quite impractical. Hardware components associated with each modality would compete for the small amount of space available around the patient and these components would interfere in ways that might seriously impede their functioning. Even if such technical problems could be solved, complexity would likely drive cost to prohibitive heights. A more realistic multi-modality strategy is to perform scans sequentially, on different physical scanners, and to fuse images afterward, mostly through software. Exceptions include hybrid scanners such as PET/CT, which are widespread, and PET/MRI, which are available but uncommon. The fact that both involve PET is not a coincidence, but rather a testimony to the fact that PET may well currently be the best available tool for diagnosing/staging cancer, and that it further requires good anatomical images such as those provided by CT or MRI for proper attenuation correction maps to be calculated.  In particular, PET/MRI scanners are true masterpieces of engineering. The two combined modalities prove especially useful in the fields of cancer detection/staging and neuroscience. Arguably, the main problem with these scanners may be that they are rare and very expensive, two problems that are not unrelated of course. Masterpieces of engineering may demand respect but they also tend to demand a high price; in contrast, the present project represents a practical and low-cost approach to multi-modality imaging. For the same reasons that drove vendors to develop PET/MRI scanners, because both modalities are so powerful in their own rights yet so complementary as well, we focus here on combining PET and MRI acquisitions. But the proposed work is not limited to these two scan types, and in the future it might well prove generalizable to any combination of sequential scans from any imaging modalities and/or radiation therapy devices. It is based on the developments of ultrasound-based sensors that can be attached to the patient's skin and accompany him/her through sequential scans, acting as a common thread across modalities. Fifty-four patients scheduled for a clinical PET/CT scan will be recruited to validate the proposed technology, and half of them will be scanned by MRI as well. Project narrative Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanners provide different and complementary diagnostic information; while PET/MRI systems combine both technologies into a same physical scanner, such multi-modality scanners tend to be very expensive and not widely available. A small, low-cost ultrasound-based sensor that attaches to the skin is proposed here that can act as a common thread between sequentially-performed PET and MRI scans, allowing data from separate scanners to be combined and fused in effect as if they had come from a single multi-modality scanner.",Ultrasound-based sensors for the fusion and motion correction of MRI and PET/CT data,10092861,R01EB030470,"['Adoption ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Breathing ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' inspiration ', ' Award ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrons ', ' Negative Beta Particle ', ' Negatrons ', ' Engineering ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Gamma Rays ', ' Gamma Radiation ', ' γ-Radiation ', ' γ-Ray ', ' Health ', ' Hybrids ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Metals ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Discipline of Nuclear Medicine ', ' Atomic Medicine ', ' Nuclear Medicine ', ' Radiology / Radiation Biology / Nuclear Medicine ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Patient Schedules ', ' Patients ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' PET ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET imaging ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PETT ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' Publishing ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' radio-therapy ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rights ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' sound ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Emission-Computed Tomography ', ' Computed Tomographic Scintigraphy ', ' Computerized Emission Tomography ', ' Radionuclide CAT Scan ', ' radionuclide emission tomography ', ' single photon emission computed tomography ', ' SPECT ', ' SPECT imaging ', ' Single-Photon Emission-Computed Radionuclide Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' Vendor ', ' Work ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' X-Ray Radiation ', ' X-ray ', ' Xray ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Localized Disease ', ' Attenuated ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' respiratory ', ' magnetic field ', ' attenuation ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI Scans ', ' Skin ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Curved Tube ', ' Data ', ' multi-modal imaging ', ' multi-modality imaging ', ' multimodality imaging ', ' Multimodal Imaging ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' image registration ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' prototype ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' imaging system ', ' contrast imaging ', ' anatomic imaging ', ' anatomical imaging ', ' recruit ', ' sensor technology ', ' sensing technology ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' motion sensor ', ' data streams ', ' ']",NIBIB,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,1342160,MA-07
"Identification of Precision Sepsis Subphenotypes Using Vital Sign Trajectories Project Abstract The scientific goal of this K23 is to apply cutting-edge data science approaches to identify novel subphenotypes within the heterogeneous sepsis syndrome. This K23 application proposes a 5-year training program to propel Dr. Sivasubramanium Bhavani towards his career as an independent physician-scientist. Dr. Bhavani’s career goal is to be an expert in developing computer-aided diagnostic tools to map the extensive clinical and biological data in the electronic health record (EHR) to personalized treatment plans for critically ill patients. Dr. Bhavani will accomplish this career goal by completing 3 short-term goals: 1) Gain expertise in unsupervised machine learning, 2) Gain expertise in deep learning neural networks, and 3) Gain expertise in clinical informatics principles for model application to real-world data. Dr. Bhavani has outlined an integrated program of didactics, seminars, conferences, and consistent communication with expert mentors to provide the necessary career development. Dr. Bhavani’s mentors are Dr. Craig Coopersmith, a past president of the Society of Critical Care Medicine with a long career of NIH-funded sepsis research, and Dr. May Wang, a renowned expert in machine learning. In addition, Dr. Bhavani’s advisors are Drs. John Hanfelt, Annette Esper, Matthew Semler and Matthew Churpek, with collective expertise in longitudinal clustering, sepsis biomarkers, and bioinformatics. With the support of the K23, Dr. Bhavani will contribute to the development of precision medicine approaches to sepsis. Sepsis is a severe and heterogeneous syndrome characterized by a dysregulated host response to infection that results in over 270,000 deaths in the U.S. annually. Decades of clinical trials have failed to identify therapies that consistently benefit patients with sepsis. The one-size-fits-all treatment approach has not worked, and there is a need to identify sepsis subphenotypes that may have different responses to treatment. To date, most studies have identified sepsis subphenotypes using static measurements of labs and vital signs. However, sepsis is a dynamic process with biological and physiological responses that evolve over minutes to hours. The objective of this proposal is to identify novel sepsis subphenotypes using dynamic data, specifically longitudinal vital signs. In Aim 1, Dr. Bhavani will apply cutting-edge machine learning algorithms to longitudinal vital signs to develop and validate novel vitals trajectory subphenotypes. In Aim 2, Dr. Bhavani will investigate the immune signatures of these subphenotypes. In Aim 3, Dr. Bhavani will study the responses of the subphenotypes to one of the most common interventions in sepsis – intravenous fluids. Identification of subphenotypes with responses to different fluids could shift sepsis management from a one-size-fits-all approach to a precision medicine approach – the ultimate objective of sepsis subphenotypes. Through the training in this K23, Dr. Bhavani will be prepared for R01-level work in a) refining subphenotypes by combining dynamic clinical and immunological data and b) studying the responses of subphenotypes to additional treatments by using data from other RCTs. Project Narrative Sepsis is a severe life-threatening response to infection that results in over 270,000 deaths in the U.S. annually. The one-size-fits-all approach to treating sepsis has not worked, and thus it is essential to identify distinct sepsis subgroups that may have differential responses to treatments. This proposal applies cutting-edge machine learning algorithms to bedside vital signs (e.g., temperature, heart rate, etc.) to identify sepsis subgroups with differential responses to treatments, thus opening the doors for the precision medicine approach to sepsis.",Identification of Precision Sepsis Subphenotypes Using Vital Sign Trajectories,10350208,K23GM144867,"['Algorithms ', ' Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', ' Anti-Inflammatories ', ' Anti-inflammatory ', ' Antiinflammatories ', ' Antiinflammatory Agents ', ' antiinflammatory ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Critical Care ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Infection ', ' Inpatients ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Maps ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Physiology ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Resuscitation ', ' Societies ', ' Syndrome ', ' Temperature ', ' Training Programs ', ' Work ', ' crystalloid ', ' cytokine ', ' Immunophenotyping ', ' Immunologic Subtyping ', ' immunophenotype ', ' Measures ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Immunologic Markers ', ' Immune Markers ', ' immune-based biomarkers ', ' immunological biomarkers ', ' immunological markers ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Hospitalization cost ', ' Training ', ' Measurement ', ' Sepsis Syndrome ', ' Funding ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Hour ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Normal saline ', ' cohort ', ' treatment planning ', ' novel ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Intravenous Fluid ', ' IV Fluid ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Validation ', ' Immunologics ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologically ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Immunomodulators ', ' IMiD ', ' Immune modulatory therapeutic ', ' immune modulating agents ', ' immune modulating drug ', ' immune modulating therapeutics ', ' immune modulators ', ' immune modulatory agents ', ' immune modulatory drugs ', ' immunomodulating agents ', ' immunomodulatory agents ', ' immunomodulatory drugs ', ' immunomodulatory therapeutics ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' computer aided ', ' Sepsis ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' comparative ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' Data Science ', ' predicting response ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' septic patients ', ' sepsis patients ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' autoencoder ', ' autoencoding neural network ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' multiplex assay ', ' ']",NIGMS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,177902,GA-05
"Timely Response to In-Hospital Deterioration Through Design of Actionable Augmented Intelligence Abstract Development of augmented intelligence (AI) models for predicting clinical outcomes is growing exponentially. Automated clinical surveillance to assist in early detection of in-hospital deterioration such as sepsis and acute kidney injury (AKI) is a promising AI application. As many as 300,000 US hospital patients die each year from problems like sepsis and AKI and 5% or more of these deaths are preventable. Many more patients suffer harm or additional costs as a sequelae to delayed response. Compared to traditional rule-based risk predictions, advanced AI models using methods such as machine learning demonstrate improved reliability of predicting sepsis and AKI. The effectiveness of these systems in practice will likely depend on how AI risk information is integrated into clinical workflow and technologies, yet we are not aware of research to design or evaluate effective in-hospital AI risk information presentation and user interaction. It is widely known that explainable AI is desirable, but what needs to be explained and how to do it effectively and efficiently is not known. There is a need to understand end user perspectives on the value of AI for specific clinical contexts. We will draw on our team's recent research on effective clinical display design, theoretical models of human-AI performance, application of human-AI design principles, and application of human-centered design methods to design and evaluate effective approaches to support timely response to sepsis and AKI risk. Our primary objectives are to: identify factors that influence clinicians' perceptions of AI usefulness, generate design principles for effective health risk surveillance human-AI interaction, and design human-AI user interfaces that meaningfully improve human-AI performance when responding to sepsis and AKI. In Aim 1, we will develop a temporal reasoning AI model for predicting in-hospital development of sepsis and AKI. We will apply this model to retrospective patient data to serve as context for research activities. Using chart review, we will quantify realistic metrics of human-AI system performance that take into account whether the AI model would have predicted deterioration before the clinical team suspected or acted in response to the event. In Aim 2, we will interview clinicians while reviewing temporal progression of a patient's change in condition over their stay, including AI generated risk information. We will gather qualitative data on factors that influence clinicians' perceptions of usefulness of AI information toward the goal of early identification of patient problems. In Aim 3, we will conduct participatory design activities with clinicians to design effective human-centered AI display and interaction to support early response to in-hospital sepsis and AKI. Finally, in Aim 4, using simulated realistic patient care tasks and comparing to traditional patient information technologies, we will evaluate the impact of human-centered AI designs on human-AI performance. We will generate human-AI interaction design guidance for health risk surveillance. Our findings are expected to innovate design for human-AI interaction in electronic health records (EHRs) and health-care monitoring and communication technologies. Narrative As many as 15,000 preventable deaths and many more preventable invasive procedures occur each year in US hospitals due to late detection of unexpected deterioration and emergencies such as cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, sepsis, and bleeding. Advanced approaches to augmented intelligence (AI) through methods such as machine learning may help clinicians to identify and respond to problems early, but little is known about how to effectively present risk information and support interaction between AI and clinicians. The goals of this project are to: identify factors that impact the usefulness of AI, design human-centered AI approaches to reduce harm from late response to sepsis and acute kidney injury, and generate design principles to ensure that AI solutions can be used effectively by clinicians to improve patient care.",Timely Response to In-Hospital Deterioration Through Design of Actionable Augmented Intelligence,10217209,R01GM137083,"['Clinical Informatics ', ' Communication ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heart Arrest ', ' Asystole ', ' Cardiac Arrest ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Interview ', ' Methods ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Reaction Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Response Time ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Utah ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Trust ', ' Research Activity ', ' Saints ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' respiratory ', ' acute kidney injury ', ' Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Early identification ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' cost ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' biomed informatics ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Information Technology ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Sepsis ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' prototype ', ' Data Science ', ' improved outcome ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' clinical decision support ', ' preventable death ', ' preventable mortality ', ' human model ', ' model of human ', ' augmented intelligence ', ' risk prediction model ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIGMS,IDAHO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,402815,ID-02
"A precision medicine framework to improve long-term outcomes in Sepsis Survivors PROJECT ABSTRACT Advances in acute care have decreased short-term mortality of sepsis, resulting in an increasing number of survivors who experience significant morbidity and mortality. Recurrent infections account for 60% of hospital readmissions after sepsis and are an important cause of long-term mortality. Identifying sepsis survivors at risk for infections and understanding predisposing factors are therefore important first steps to develop personalized interventions to improve long-term outcomes. The overall research goal is to develop innovative targeted interventions to improve long-term outcomes after sepsis. This proposal focuses on identifying subgroups of sepsis survivors (phenotypes) at high risk for infection-related hospital readmissions and deaths. It is hypothesized that the combination of host factors, disease characteristics, and interventions prior to and during sepsis will identify distinct phenotypes that are captured by clinical data. These clinical phenotypes likely have distinct pathophysiologic mechanisms (e.g., immunosuppression), predispose to different outcomes (e.g., recurrent infections), and patients with the same phenotype may respond similarly to targeted interventions such as immunomodulation. In Aim 1, three nationally representative datasets of sepsis survivors will be assembled and analyzed by machine learning techniques to identify valid clinical sepsis phenotypes. In Aim 2, phenotypes at high-risk for infection-related readmissions and deaths at 6 months will be identified, and underlying biomarker profiles for these phenotypes analyzed. In Aim 3, these high-risk phenotypes will be used to conceptualize and simulate an adaptive platform trial designed to test the efficacy of three different immunomodulatory drugs. An adaptive trial design was chosen, because it can test multiple interventions simultaneously and reduces the chances of exposing patients to ineffective or harmful interventions. The research plan is augmented by expert mentoring and rigorous didactic training. Together, this will provide the candidate with essential career development skills in the science of precision medicine, including machine learning methodologies, Bayesian statistics, and innovate clinical trial design. This proposal has potentially groundbreaking implications for the future treatment of sepsis survivors, because it deviates from the current “one-size fits all” approach and attempts to create the framework for personalized interventions. This framework sets the stage for future independent investigator (RO1) applications evaluating personalized treatments in adaptive clinical trials, and will uniquely position the candidate as a future leader in the field of long-term outcomes after critical illness. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project is important for public health because sepsis is a life-threatening infection that affects 30 million people worldwide each year. Long-term outcomes for patients who survive a hospital admission for sepsis are poor, and many patients develop new disabilities or worsening of preexisting health conditions. This proposal supports the NIH’s mission to enhance health and reduce illness and disability by trying to identify interventions for sepsis survivors at highest risk for poor outcomes.",A precision medicine framework to improve long-term outcomes in Sepsis Survivors,10120705,K23GM132688,"['Affect ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' HLA Antigens ', ' HL-A Antigens ', ' Human Leukocyte Antigens ', ' Leukocyte Antigens ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunosuppression ', ' Immunosuppression Effect ', ' Immunosuppressive Effect ', ' immune suppression ', ' Infection ', ' IL7 gene ', ' IL-7 ', ' IL-7 Gene ', ' IL7 ', ' IL7 Protein ', ' Interleukin 7 Precursor ', ' Interleukin 7 Precursor Gene ', ' Interleukin-7 ', ' Interleukin-7 Gene ', ' Lymphopoietin-1 ', ' Mentors ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity -

"Functional Cardiovascular 4D MRI in Congenital Heart Disease SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect, affecting 1.2% of all live births. Imaging plays a major role in managing CHD but remains challenging for evaluating complex cardiac and vascular abnormalities across a wide range of age and habitus. To address these limitations, the PIs have developed cardiovascular 4D flow MRI which can measure complex 3D blood flow in-vivo, a task difficult or impossible to obtain with other imaging strategies. Recent efforts have focused on two forms of CHD: 1) bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) which is the most common form of CHD, and 2) single ventricle physiology (SVP), one of the most severe forms of CHD. Our 4D flow MRI studies have successfully identified new hemodynamic biomarkers to better characterize CHD. We were the first to establish a physiologic link between aberrant 3D blood flow, elevated wall shear stress (WSS), aortopathy phenotype, and aortic wall tissue degeneration on histopathology in patients with BAV. In patients with SVP, our findings demonstrated relationships between surgical correction strategies and flow distribution to the lungs, a known factor implicated in SVP outcome. We have achieved successful clinical translation at Northwestern, where 4D flow MRI is now used as a clinical tool in diagnostic MRI exams for patients with CHD and aortic disease. Over the past four years, the PIs have assembled one of the largest 4D MRI databases with over 2500 patient exams. For this renewal application, we identified a need to increase the dynamic range of 4D MRI flow sensitivity to account for data complexity (3D + time) and the wide age range in CHD by a combination of dual-venc flow encoding, compressed sensing, and SSFP imaging. Second, three is a need for longitudinal studies to identify predictors of BAV and SVP outcome. Third, making these unique but complex 4D MRI data sets and analysis tools more widely available to the greater research community is challenging. In addition, no automated methods currently exist for advanced processing such as atlas based analysis across large cohorts. Analysis is thus time consuming and requires manual interactions (e.g. 3D vessel segmentation) which limits reproducibility and translation. To address this need, an established Northwestern data archival and pipeline processing resource based on remote high-performance computing clusters (NUNDA) will be utilized for standardized data archival, sharing, and pipeline processing of 4D MRI data. This platform will provide the unique opportunity to utilize annotated data available in the 4D MRI database (>1300 BAV, SVP, and control 4D MRI data analyzed in the initial funding cycle) for application of machine learning concepts to establish (semi-)automated 4D MRI analysis workflows in NUNDA. Thus, the renewal application for this study aims to 1) develop a rapid (15 min) non-contrast 4D MRI for clinical translation, 2) leverage the existing large 4D MRI database to identify 4D MRI metrics predictive of long-term (> 5 years) CHD patient outcome, and 3) establish a remote NUNDA platform for 4D MRI data sharing and automated analysis across large cohorts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop non-contrast 4D MRI, a new diagnostic test to achieve an improved assessment for the most common and one of the most severe forms of congenital heart disease: bicuspid aortic valve and single ventricle physiology. We will leverage an existing large 4D MRI database to allow for long-term 5-8-year follow-up to establish new measures for improved outcome prediction and therapy management for patients with bicuspid aortic valve and single ventricle physiology. A comprehensive data archive will be established to allow for the dissemination of the 4D MRI data, analysis tools, and study results to the greater research community.",Functional Cardiovascular 4D

"Multi-Center Implementation and Validation of Efficient Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Analysis of Atherosclerotic Disease of the Cervical Carotid Abstract: Numerous investigations over the past decades have yielded substantial innovations in MR methods for the characterization of extracranial carotid atherosclerosis. Images obtained with these innovations under ideal conditions have given clinicians rich information about disease in the arterial wall and the hope for tools critically needed for adequate management of this insidious disease. Despite this, the great potential power of this technology has not made it into the routine clinical armamentarium. Indeed, because of the need for gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA), the long exam time (typically about 45 minutes to obtain the multiple contrasts in the 5 or 6 necessary sequences), and the steep learning curve required to interpret multi- contrast MRI most practitioners still revert to the simplified metric of diameter stenosis in assessing risk. After many collective years of investigations, the consortium of investigators collaborating on this proposal believes that the time is right to address these remaining limitations and ultimately shift the clinical paradigm. Overarching hypothesis: To achieve the great potential in the management of cervical carotid disease, a highly efficient and easily used MRI technique is required. Our hypothesis is that this can be accomplished using multi-parametric non-contrast MRI sequences coupled with the latest high signal to noise ratio (SNR) neck-shape-specific (NSS) RF coils and innovative machine learning (deep neural network) analysis methods. Aim 1: We will install identical RF coils, MRI sequences, and protocols at each of our 5 participating centers as well as rigorously test the accuracy of measurements and reproducibility of image quality from all centers. Aim 2: We will develop, train, and validate a user friendly, deep learning neural network system for the quantitative analysis of several key components considered to be present in the vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque. Aim 3: We will apply the analysis to a cohort of carotid disease subjects to establish the repeatability of the quantitative measures, as well as the accuracy of characterization in comparison to histopathology. Although we will develop and test the image quality, reproducibility and reliability in a network of highly skilled academic centers, we will design these methods to be applicable in the community hospital setting. At the conclusion of this project, we propose to have an integrated solution that can be used in subsequent investigations such as: the effect of pharmacologic intervention in modifying the composition of the plaque; studying the evolution of features of the untreated atheromatous disease over time; and, eventually, investigating the metrics that are predictive of deleterious outcomes, and that can be used in improving intervention strategies in this population. On successful completion, the RF coils and MRI sequences and analysis methods will be made available to other imaging centers in a manner that ultimately changes the paradigm of diagnosis and managing the treatment of cervical carotid atherosclerotic disease. Narrative: The goal of this project is to develop and test at multiple centers a highly efficient and easily used MRI technique for the analysis and management of cervical carotid disease.

"Situation Awareness to Improve Infant Sepsis Recognition in the Presence of Clinical Uncertainty PROJECT SUMMARY Sepsis has higher mortality in infants than other pediatric age groups, is associated with severe long- term morbidities in 30-50% of survivors, and burdens healthcare resources with prolonged hospitalization and complex interventions. Rapid identification of sepsis and timely initiation of antimicrobial therapy are critical to improve infant outcomes. However, limitations to current diagnostic approaches include the heterogeneous, subtle clinical presentation of infants and limited accuracy of laboratory tests. There is therefore an urgent need for strategies to improve the early detection of sepsis in infants to improve outcomes. Our objective is to improve sepsis recognition by developing an infant sepsis early recognition system that combines patient data with predictive model outputs to deliver timely, precise and relevant information to clinicians and nurses. Our hypothesis is that the integration of a predictive model with clinical data displays that improve situation awareness will improve timely sepsis recognition and management. We will utilize the strong foundation of our preliminary work in predictive modeling and existing data from our neonatal sepsis registry to produce novel methods to identify infants at greatest risk for neonatal sepsis. We have assembled a multi-disciplinary team of investigators from the disciplines of data science, clinical informatics, neonatology, and sepsis/infectious disease research to provide expert consensus recommendations. At the conclusion of the proposed work, we will have developed methods that support the integration of clinical data and machine learning outputs into decision support tools suited to clinical workflows. We anticipate such systems that pair advanced prediction methods with user-centered design processes will have broad applicability to many conditions and populations. This work will form the foundation for a future clinical trial to evaluate its ability to identify infants at highest risk of sepsis and provide clinicians and nurses with the decision support needed to improve their health and safety. PROJECT NARRATIVE The rapid diagnosis of bacterial sepsis and timely initiation of antibiotics is crucial for reducing neonatal mortality and improving morbidity. However, subtle clinical signs and inaccurate laboratory tests make rapid diagnosis especially difficult in infants.

"Renal MRI Biomarkers: The Route to Clinical Adoption Project Summary/ Abstract Functional renal MRI biomarkers are underused in research and clinical practice due to the need for dedicated in-house expertise and development. Transferring solutions to other centers is therefore a challenge, leading to a significant duplication of efforts, a lack of standardization in the methods, and difficulties in comparing results between centers. This also limits commercial buy-in, hinders the establishment of multi-center trials, and overall impedes the translation of these biomarkers into clinical practice. Our proposed workshop (https://www.ismrm.org/workshops/2021/Renal/) aims to bridge this gap. The purpose of this workshop is to bring together internationally recognized scientists and clinicians with new investigators who are currently developing and applying advanced renal MRI techniques in order to investigate the causes and consequences of kidney disease. The program of this workshop integrates clinical presentations outlining the needs for non-invasive testing and biomarkers with presentations on recent advances in contrast-based MRI, new applications of relaxometry, diffusion, and elastography, multinuclear applications, pre-clinical animal studies, and application of artificial intelligence techniques. With an important focus on the next generation, the workshop will include mentoring sessions for trainees and new investigators, called “Meet the Experts.” These mentoring sessions will provide specific information on clinical trials design, funding and regulations, as well as a hands-on “how I do it” sessions on available imaging post-processing software. This workshop is designed for researchers (including Ph.D. students and postdocs); clinicians (e.g., radiologists, nephrologists, renal transplant surgeons); MR technologists; government regulatory experts; nonprofit and academic groups interested in early diagnosis of renal disease; as well as members of the ISMRM, ASN, and PARENCHIMA. The program is designed for both senior investigators and junior scientists, with relevant topics for our attendees interested in continuing medical education. It presents knowledge of new methodologies in using quantitative MRI to diagnose and monitor a range of medical conditions, e.g., renal tissue injury, oxygenation, contrast and non-contrast perfusion, renal pre-transplant and post- transplant evaluations, etc. We will provide methods for utilizing this knowledge in clinical trials and practice, as well as guidance on data analysis. A key element of our plan is to reach out to women and minorities to encourage them to attend and participate in our workshop. This workshop will be a first in North America but follows three previous European meetings co-organized by the UK Renal Imaging Network (UKRIN) and the COST action “MRI Biomarkers for Chronic Kidney Disease” (PARENCHIMA). (https://renalmri.org). These previous workshops were attended by over 150 participants and presenters. Thus, we expect robust interest in the community for the proposed workshop.

"Collaborative Platform for Developing Sepsis Products by Leveraging Sepsis Endotypes Developed Using a Unified Biomarker-Clinical Dataset Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle): Reddy, Jr., Bobby Project Summary: Sepsis is a poorly understood clinical syndrome characterized by a dysregulation of the immune system’s response to infection. It is the leading cause of death and is the most expensive condition treated in U.S. hospitals, exerting a $20.3 billion burden in 2011, 5.2% of total costs to the healthcare system nationwide. One of the major challenges facing clinicians is to identify and recognize patients with sepsis and impending organ dysfunction. The clinical manifestations of sepsis are highly variable and the signs of infection and organ dysfunction can be subtle and may mimic other conditions. Sepsis is also highly time critical. Every 1-hour delay in antibiotics after emergency department (ED) triage or the onset of organ dysfunction or shock is associated with a 3–7% increase in the odds of a poor outcome. These conditions have created an environment where physicians have to diagnose a complex, heterogeneous condition in a short timeframe with limited information. There is currently a dire need for a tool that can quickly assess if a patient is at risk for sepsis. Prenosis is a company focused on elucidating the complexity of dysregulated host response to infection. In partnership with 4 hospitals, we have built the world’s largest and most rapidly growing dataset & data-rich biobank that combine time series biomarker data with clinical data for patients suspected of infection in hospital environments. This dataset & biobank currently have >2,000 patients, >70,000 proprietary biomarker measurements, >1,200,000 Electronic Medical Record (EMR) parameters, and >25,000 samples banked (all with accompanying full time series EMR data). We currently have executed contracts for 6 total hospital partnerships, with the potential to expand the dataset by >65,000 patients per year if our pipeline were at full capacity. In this proposed project, Prenosis will finalize the first version of the NOSISTM platform by growing our current proprietary dataset & biobank from its current size of about 2,000 patients to over 10,000 total patients (Aim 1). Using the current 2,000 patient dataset, we have demonstrated initial promising endotypes of sepsis that could be useful for a variety of critical clinical problems. As we grow the dataset to 10,000 patients, we will use unsupervised machine learning algorithms trained on roughly half of the patients (5,000) to definitively prove the robustness and usefulness of these endotypes. The other half of the patients (other 5,000) will be used as a multi-site validation cohort for the endotypes determined by the ML algorithms (Aim 2). We will also finalize the actual software platform for the NOSISTM product (Aim 3), including data security, restricted access by collaborators to train and jointly develop products, and templates for business partnerships with potential collaborators (with an initial focus on HIT companies and pharma companies). Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle): Reddy, Jr., Bobby Project Narrative: At least 30 percent of antibiotics prescribed in the United States are unnecessary. This has obviously catastrophic implications for the future of humanity. Sepsis is the third leading cause of death in the United States with an annual toll of over 230,000 people. Survival rates have been reported to drop by 7.6% per hour appropriate treatment is delayed. This drastic drop in survival rate leads to vast over prescription of antibiotics in hospital settings. Prenosis is a company focused on elucidating the complexity of dysregulated host response to infection. In partnership with 4 hospitals, we have built the world’s largest and most rapidly growing dataset & data-rich biobank that combine time series biomarker data with clinical data for patients suspected of infection in hospital environments.

We currently have executed contracts for 6 total hospital partnerships, with the potential to expand the dataset by >65,000 patients per year if our pipeline were at full capacity. In this project, we are proposing work to finalize our NOSISTM product. NOSISTM is a software platform that allows collaborators (hospital IT departments, researchers, health information technology (HIT) companies, drug companies, and government agencies) to utilize the constantly growing proprietary Prenosis dataset & accompanying data-rich biobank. Using NOSISTM, collaborators can develop new sepsis screening technologies and clinical decision support tools, dramatically increase success of clinical drug trials, and revolutionize our scientific understanding of the endotypes of dysregulation of host response.",Collaborative Platform for Developing Sepsis Products by Leveraging Sepsis Endotypes Developed Using a Unified Biomarker-Clinical Dataset,10252921,R44GM139529,"['Algorithms ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Award ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Charge ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Fees ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Government Agencies ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Hospitals ', ' University Hospitals ', ' Infection ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Proteins ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Security Measures ', ' Shock ', ' Circulatory Collapse ', ' circulatory shock ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Syndrome ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Triage ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Businesses ', ' Data Security ', ' Data awareness ', ' information security ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Measurement ', ' Data Storage and Retrieval ', ' data retrieval ', ' data storage ', ' Sample Size ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' payment ', ' Reporting ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Sampling ', ' Drops ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Security ', ' Validation ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Derivation procedure ', ' Derivation ', ' cost ', ' Sepsis ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' Outcome ', ' encryption ', ' commercialization ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' health information technology ', ' Secure ', ' screening ', ' data hosting ', ' support tools ', ' specific biomarkers ', ' clinical decision support ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' algorithm training ', ' data de-identification ', ' data deidentification ', ' de-identified data ', ' deidentified data ', ' ']",NIGMS,"PRENOSIS, INC.",R44,2021,989522,IL-13
"Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI Project Abstract Motivation: This is a competing renewal of our successful project, Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI, R01 EB009690. MRI offers superb soft tissue contrast for children, without the ionizing radiation and cancer risk of CT. However, MRI use has been limited due to long exams, low spatial resolution, and motion-artifacts. Thus, MRI often requires prolonged anesthesia with breath-holds and attendant risk; hence, children often lack the beneﬁts of cross-sectional imaging altogether or are exposed to ionizing radiation. The previous project addressed these concerns by creating a dedicated pediatric imaging system. Highly par- allel, high-SNR 3T receive coil arrays were designed and constructed speciﬁcally for pediatric body imaging. The high SNR was used to accelerate scans reconstructed with a combination of parallel imaging, new mo- tion correction algorithms, compressed sensing (CS), and higher dimensional imaging. The resulting system is now being used extensively in clinical practice, signiﬁcantly reducing anesthesia depth and duration, and has markedly increased our MRI utilization. Key technologies have been or are now being commercialized with GE Healthcare, including the pediatric receive array, CS, 4D ﬂow, full-Fourier single-shot T2-weighted scanning, and coil compression. Siemens has licensed ﬁve of our patents, implemented them in work-in-progress packages, and productized our coil compression and our ESPIRiT coil sensitivity estimation. Philips has licensed three of our patents. This ensures broad impact. Approach: Despite signiﬁcant progress and reduced anesthesia depth and duration, patient cooperation re- mains the main limitation to eliminate anesthesia in all pediatric body MRI exams. Many children will cooperate for several minutes, but then ﬁdget and get out of the scanner. Others are content until acoustic noise agi- tates them. Therefore the major emphasis now is greater exam execution speed, comprehensive elimination of acoustic noise, and increased robustness, particularly to contrast agent injection. The project has three interrelated development aims, validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable fast 2D imag- ing for quiet T2 and quiet low-distortion diffusion weighted imaging. A second aim is to develop free-breathing 3D contrast-enhanced and diffusion-weighted imaging that is silent and motion-robust. The third aim will enable au- tomated, smart scanning to speed the exam execution and adaptive protocols to increase the exam robustness. The impact of all of these developments in the clinic will then be assessed to assess the resulting reduction of anesthesia. Signiﬁcance: This work will lead to fast, robust, broadly-applicable pediatric MRI protocols with less anes- thesia, making MRI safer, cheaper, and more available to children. MRI will be transformed into a workhorse modality, reducing CT radiation burden. The techniques will facilitate wide application in the community setting and permit new MRI applications, for both pediatric and adult diseases. Project Narrative Pediatric MRI often requires anesthesia. After considerable progress reducing the depth and duration of anes- thesia, this work aims to reduce the frequency of anesthesia through a synergistic combination of fast, quiet, motion-robust, automated, and adaptive scanning. This will make MRI safer, cheaper, and more widely available to children, reducing the population risk of radiation from CT.",Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI,10155483,R01EB009690,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anesthesia procedures ', ' Anesthesia ', ' Breathing ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' inspiration ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Contrast Media ', ' Contrast Agent ', ' Contrast Drugs ', ' Radiopaque Media ', ' Diagnostic Imaging ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' Image Enhancement ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Motivation ', ' Noise ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patents ', ' Patients ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Ionizing radiation ', ' Ionizing Electromagnetic Radiation ', ' Radiation-Ionizing Total ', ' ionizing output ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Work ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' soft tissue ', ' Body part ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' data quality ', ' Funding ', ' Letters ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Scanning ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' Speed ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' Radiation ', ' design and construct ', ' design and construction ', ' 3-D Imaging ', ' 3D imaging ', ' Three-Dimensional Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI Scans ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Image Compression ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' patient cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' treatment compliance ', ' compliance behavior ', ' Address ', ' Bolus ', ' Bolus Infusion ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Pediatric Oncology ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' reconstruction ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' volunteer ', ' community setting ', ' clinical practice ', ' pediatric patients ', ' child patients ', ' contrast enhanced ', ' T2 weighted imaging ', ' T2 imaging ', ' T2 weighted image ', ' imaging system ', ' radiation risk ', ' clinical translation ', ' high dimensionality ', ' Injections ', ' Child Health ', ' patient tolerability ', ' patient tolerance ', ' ']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,631942,CA-18
"Validation and early development of a blood-based rapid diagnostic test for sepsis endotypes ABSTRACT Sepsis, a systemic inflammatory condition, occurs as a complication of infection and in severe cases may be associated with acute and life-threatening organ dysfunction. In the US alone, sepsis claims ~270,000 lives each year among ~1.7 million patients diagnosed annually, and globally, sepsis-related mortality is estimated to account for 20% of total deaths. Although improvements in the treatment protocol for sepsis and timely administration of antibiotics have reduced mortality rates, not a single drug for sepsis has ever been successfully brought to market, despite over 100 interventional trials, and it is treated today as 60 years ago: antibiotics and supportive care. Sepsis is unusual in that a great deal of the immune response is actually adaptive (beneficial) vs. disease-causing (maladaptive), so reversing the inflammatory response can cause the infection to go unchecked. We believe that a treatment should reverse the maladaptive (organ-damaging) components of the immune response, while keeping the adaptive (pathogen-fighting) components intact. We believe that to achieve impactful progress, new approaches are required that harness immune sub-groups. In this project, we propose a precision medicine approach to subdivide sepsis patients into treatable subclasses or “endotypes” using a companion diagnostic test, HostDx-Endotypes. We anticipate that classifying sepsis patients into such endotypes may allow us to identify improved treatment regimens, leading to the discovery of new targets or pathways for endotype-specific therapies and/or repurposing of available drugs. In Phase 1 work we already demonstrated proof-of-concept by identifying 3 sepsis endotypes (Inflammopathic, Adaptive, and Coagulopathic) and validated across multiple external data sets. We have shown that our HostDx Endotypes can stratify patients into novel, potentially treatable subgroups across 3 publications using several retrospective cohorts, and two prospective cohorts. We have also demonstrated the clinical utility of this paradigm with InSepTM, our robust classifier for acute infectious disease, based on our HostDx point of care test system platform. To bridge our proof-of-concept work to product development for HostDx-Endotypes, we will (Aim 1) employ rigorous machine learning algorithms and processes to finalize and lock an optimal classifier; (Aim 2) apply an innovative approach of drug repurposing to identify and rank-order endotype-specific drug candidates for clinical studies on sepsis treatment, and (Aim 3) translate the final mRNA panel to Inflammatix’s qLAMP cartridge and platform. At Phase II completion we will have produced the HostDx Endotypes research-ready cartridge, together with a list of repurposed drugs for intended clinical trials, and will be ready to enter the formal product development phase; we will have initiated the FDA pre-submission. Ultimately, the goal of this product will be to definitively link a patient sepsis endotype with a therapeutic intervention, to enable better therapy selection and resource allocation. NARRATIVE Sepsis is a significant public health crisis, but despite over 100 interventional drug trials, effective sepsis treatments have proven elusive; emerging data suggests that this may be related to immune sub-groups of sepsis, wherein some components provide beneficial responses, while others are disease-causing. Inflammatix believes that to achieve impactful progress, new approaches are required that harness these immune sub- groups, and our proposed HostDx-Endotypes test offers a precision medicine approach that would subdivide sepsis patients into treatable subclasses or “endotypes”. This point-of-care cartridge-based blood test will enable clinicians to make timely and precise determinations of sepsis endotype that would definitively link a patient sepsis endotype with a therapeutic intervention, to enable better therapy selection and resource allocation.",Validation and early development of a blood-based rapid diagnostic test for sepsis endotypes,10324978,R44GM142428,"['Affect ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Complication ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Blood Tests ', ' Hematologic Tests ', ' Hematological Tests ', ' Hematology Testing ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Infection ', ' Libraries ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Safety ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Cohort Analysis ', ' Cohort Analyses ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' therapy selection ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Inflammatory ', ' tool ', ' Supportive Therapy ', ' Supportive care ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' fighting ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Severities ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Venipunctures ', ' Immunomodulation ', ' immune modulation ', ' immune regulation ', ' immunologic reactivity control ', ' immunomodulatory ', ' immunoregulatory ', ' immunoregulation ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' drug action ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Subgroup ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' point of care ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' Expression Signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' gene expression signature ', ' transcriptional profile ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Sepsis ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' pathogen ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' transcriptomics ', ' Network-based ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' product development ', ' drug candidate ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' clinically actionable ', ' companion diagnostics ', ' diagnostic biomarker ', ' diagnostic marker ', ' genetic signature ', ' gene signatures ', ' patient stratification ', ' stratified patient ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' Retrospective cohort ', ' septic patients ', ' sepsis patients ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' learning classifier ', ' Phase I/II Clinical Trial ', ' Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial ', ' Rapid diagnostics ', ' drug repurposing ', ' repurposing agent ', ' repurposing medication ', ' rapid test ', ' rapid assay ', ' rapid tests ', ' biomarker signature ', ' point of care testing ', ' ']",NIGMS,"INFLAMMATIX, INC.",R44,2021,683888,CA-14
"Low- and Zero-dose Contrast-enhanced MRI Using Deep Learning Project Summary Motivation: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are used in approximately a third of all MRI scans. The unique relaxation parameters of GBCAs create indispensable image contrast for a wide range of clinical applications, such as angiography and tumor detection. However, the usage of GBCAs has been linked to the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). NSF can be painful, cause severe disability, and even death. The risk of developing NSF prevents millions of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) from receiving contrast-enhanced MRI exams. The recent identification of gadolinium deposition within the brain and body has raised additional safety concerns about the usage of GBCAs. Studies have demonstrated increased signal intensity on the unenhanced T1-weighted MR images that is correlated with previous GBCA exposure, and this gadolinium retention is independent of renal function. While initial reports focused on linear GBCAs, more recent reports show that gadolinium deposition occurs with macrocyclic GBCAs as well, albeit at lower levels. FDA has recently issued warnings about gadolinium retention following contrast-enhanced MRI, and required GBCA manufacturers to conduct human and animal studies to further assess the safety of these contrast agents. This project addresses these concerns by developing low-dose and zero-dose contrast-enhanced MRI using artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL). Approach: This fast-track project has two phases and three aims. Aim 1 (Phase I) is to develop a DL method that can synthesize full-dose contrast-enhanced MR images using pre-contrast images and contrast-enhanced images acquired with only 10% of standard GBCA dose. A software infrastructure will be constructed to seamlessly integrate the DL software between MR scanners and PACS. Aim 2 (Phase II) is to develop a DL method that can synthesize full-dose contrast-enhanced MR images using GBCA-free acquisitions with different image contrast. In Aim 3 (Phase II), we will clinically validate and evaluate both low-dose and zero-dose DL methods, including on patients with mild- to-moderate CKD. Non-inferiority tests and diagnostic performance of the synthesized full-dose images compared to the true full-dose images will be performed. Significance: This work will lead to safer contrast-enhanced MRI. The low-dose and zero-dose contrast-enhanced MRI method will benefit not only millions of patients with advanced CKD, who cannot currently undergo contrast-enhanced MRI, but many more patients with normal kidney function, who are at the risk of gadolinium retention after contrast-enhanced MRI. Project Narrative Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are widely used in MRI exams to create indispensable image contrast for monitoring treatment and investigating pathology and function. However, the usage of GBCAs has been linked to the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, preventing patients with advanced chronic kidney disease from receiving contrast-enhanced MRI exams, as well as potential gadolinium deposition in the body and brain for patients with normal kidney function.

"Next-Generation Cardiovascular MRI powered by Artificial Intelligence Project Summary/Abstract: Despite the accuracy and versatility of cardiovascular MRI, its footprint is only 1% among cardiac imaging tests (SPECT, echocardiography, CT, MRI) in the US. While there are several factors such as referral patterns favoring SPECT and echocardiography among cardiologists that account for low utilization, the two addressable obstacles that preclude widespread adoption are lengthy scan time (imaging facility operational cost) and reading (physician cost). These obstacles must be addressed for community hospitals with limited resources to adopt cardiovascular MRI into clinical routine practice. While compressed sensing (CS), since its introduction into the MRI world in 2007, has led to highly-accelerated cardiovascular MRI acquisitions, the subsequent image reconstruction remains too slow (> 5 min for 2D time series, > 1 hour for 3D time series) for clinical translation (unmet need 1). Downstream, image analysis for cardiovascular MRI is notoriously labor intensive (e.g. 30- to 60-min) and limited (“circles” at two cardiac phases for cine MRI, whereas perfusion and late gadolinium-enhanced (LGE) images are evaluated visually), for what is essentially a basic computer vision task (unmet need 2). In direct response, we will address these two unmet needs and unlock the enormous potential of CMR using deep learning (DL). DL applications have exploded since advancements in optimization and GPU hardware. While several recent studies have applied neural networks such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), U-Nets, and Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) for reconstruction and segmentation, no study has implemented an inline end-to-end pipeline that receives raw k-space from the MRI scanner and delivers both reconstructed images and fully processed images automatically with high speed (< 1 min). The objectives of this study are: a) developing a network for image reconstruction with maximal acceleration (aim 1), (b) developing a network for image processing tasks (aim 2), and c) developing an integrated, end-to-end network that does both (aim 3). By developing an architecture that can simultaneously learn maximal acceleration, fine tune end-to-end performance, and perform reconstruction/inference using feed-forward networks, we anticipate a disruptive technology that will lead to a paradigm shift in cardiovascular MRI and increase its footprint in community hospitals. This 2-year study is doable because of the requisite database of raw k-space (not derived from DICOM) data (N = 617) and annotated cardiac MR images (N=3,021) from over 3,000 patients existing at our institution. Success of this proposal will deliver a disruptive technology that has potential to cause a paradigm shift in cardiovascular MRI and enable widespread adoption of cardiovascular MRI into clinical routine practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE: The goal of this proposal is to develop a new-generation cardiovascular MRI technology empowered by artificial intelligence, more specifically deep learning.

"Precision Medicine Approach to Glucocortisteroids in Sepsis PROJECT SUMMARY Sepsis is a disorder that contributes to approximately 1 in 3 hospital deaths in the United States and 1 in 5 deaths worldwide. Advancing sepsis management has been challenging in part due to the heterogeneity of septic patients in demographics, comorbidities, infectious source, microbiologic etiology, and level of organ dysfunction. Our group has previously identified sepsis subclasses that differ in prognosis and response to treatment, suggesting that precision medicine may improve sepsis care. Glucocorticoids (GCs) are commonly used in septic patients despite inconsistent results from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and they are an ideal candidate to develop a precision medicine approach. Recently, two of the largest RCTs ever conducted to test efficacy of GCs in sepsis (APROCCHSS and ADRENAL) also demonstrated conflicting results. Reconciling discordant results between trials has proved challenging with traditional methods but may be facilitated by state-of-the-art computational approaches which incorporate machine learning to estimate the conditional average treatment effect based on individual covariate patterns. In this proposal, we will create a ‘knowledge network’ using clinical and biologic data from 4 RCTs of GCs in sepsis (APROCCHSS, ADRENAL, ESCAPe, HYPRESS) and electronic health record data (Sepsis Endotyping in Emergency Care project). In Aim 1, we will utilize unsupervised and supervised learning approaches using clinical data from RCTs to characterize heterogeneity of treatment effect, identify subclasses that benefit, and develop a treatment policy to reduce 90-day mortality. In Aim 2, we will use causal Bayesian modeling approaches that incorporate RCT and EHR data to identify effect modifiers and confounders of GC therapy and mortality. We will use these results to develop a treatment policy to reduce 90-day mortality. Secondary analyses will compare RCT-only policies in Aim 1 to RCT-EHR policies in Aim 2. In Aim 3, we will perform cytokine assays and RNAseq using samples from the ADRENAL, ESCAPe, and HYPRESS trials to identify endotypes that benefit from GCs. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team of clinical trialists, biostatisticians, computational biologists, and critical care specialists with an established track record of collaboration for this proposal. Successful completion of our Aims will reconcile discordant results of prior RCTs testing GCs in sepsis, develop a treatment policy that can be deployed in EHRs, and improve design of future RCTs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Personalized medicine holds the promise of improving care for patients with severe infections (sepsis). Glucocorticoids (often referred to as steroids) are commonly used in the treatment of septic patients, but it is unclear which patients benefit and which patients may be harmed.

"Artificial Intelligence Boosted Evolution and Detection of Genetically Encoded Reporters for In Vivo Imaging PROJECT SUMMARY Magnetic resonance (MR) reporter genes have the potential to monitor transgene expression non-invasively in real time at high resolution. These genes can be applied to interrogate the efficacy of gene therapy, to monitor viral therapeutics and viral gene delivery, to assess cellular differentiation, cell trafficking, and specific metabolic activity, and also assess changes in the microenvironment. Efforts toward the development of MR reporter genes have been made for over a decade, but, despite these efforts, the field is still in its early developmental stage. This reflects the fact that there are numerous complications, caused by the low sensitivity of detection, the need for substrates with their associated undesirable pharmacokinetics, and/or the difficult and, in some cases, delayed interpretation of signal changes. We have previously demonstrated that many of these challenges can be overcome with the use of a lysine rich protein (LRP) reporter gene, that is detectable by chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI. However, to mature the CEST reporter gene technology and bring it towards clinical translation, its sensitivity and specificity need to be improved. In particular, the LRP reporter gene specificity is limited by the fact that the lysine amide exchangeable protons of LRP have the same chemical shift as amide protons from endogenous proteins. It is therefore difficult to distinguish the reporter CEST contrast from the background CEST contrast, both of which may be changing with time. The specificity is further limited by the sensitivity of the CEST contrast to intracellular pH where the qualitative CEST contrast cannot distinguish between exchange rate and concentration effects. Finally, a decrease in cytosolic pH, observed in many disease pathologies, reduces the amide proton exchange rate and hence the CEST reporter sensitivity. We therefore propose to develop improved MRI reporter genes and quantitative MRI detection methods that will facilitate the clinical translation of these methods for imaging biological therapeutics, such as oncolytic virotherapy. We hypothesize that CEST reporter genes with improved sensitivity and specificity along with improved quantitative CEST methods will enable viral infection and replication to be monitored longitudinally throughout OV tumor therapy. To test this hypothesis and establish the clinical potential of MRI reporter genes we will capitalize on two transformative technologies developed in our labs; (Aim 1) an artificial intelligence based genetic programming algorithm will be used for optimizing the sensitivity and specificity of the CEST reporter gene and (Aim 2) a CEST magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) method will be used for the rapid quantification of both the reporter protein concentration and chemical exchange rate. (Aim 3) These methods will be validated for imaging oncolytic viral infection and replication in mouse glioblastoma tumor models. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cell and viral based therapies have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of many diseases. However, the optimization of such biological therapies depends critically on the ability to monitor the spread and persistence of the therapeutic agent and assess the tissue response. This project therefore proposes to develop and optimize a novel MRI reporter gene technology that allows for the imaging of biological therapeutics.

"Characterization of Renal Allograft Fibrosis and Prediction of Outcome Using a Quantitative MRI Approach Project Summary Renal transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients with end stage renal disease. However, improvements in long-term allograft survival have not matched the observed improvements in the management of rejection. Progressive allograft dysfunction is frequently encountered clinically. The final common pathway of cumulative and incremental renal damage from several etiologies identified by histopathology is interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IFTA), which is associated with progression of renal dysfunction and reduced allograft survival. Histopathologic assessment and staging of IFTA requires tissue sampling, which is limited due to its invasive nature, risk of complications, inter-individual variability and sampling error. In this proposal, we will test a non-contrast advanced multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) protocol comprised of advanced relaxometry (T1 mapping and T1) and advanced diffusion weighted imaging (IVIM-DWI) as noninvasive markers of renal allograft fibrosis. This is motivated by our preliminary data demonstrating that mpMRI yields highly repeatable parameter measurements that capture allograft fibrosis. Our preliminary experience correlating mpMRI with IFTA is valuable, as confounding physiologic and pathophysiologic variables such as vascular flow, edema and other Banff phenotypes commonly co-exist. The multiparametric approach allows us to simultaneously capture and characterize these concurrent physiologic and pathophysiologic processes. As a secondary objective, we will assess the value of urinary RNA level based biomarkers, which have been previously validated for the diagnosis of IFTA. In this proposal, we aim to: 1) acquire data in patients undergoing indication and surveillance biopsy, using a non-contrast mpMRI protocol comprised of advanced diffusion weighted and relaxometry methods in order to accurately detect and stage allograft IFTA, and 2) other histopathological Banff measures of inflammation. We will build and validate diagnostic models using advanced statistical methods including machine learning in independent model-building and validation sets of renal transplant patients for detection and staging of each Banff measure, and assess the added value of urinary biomarkers of fibrosis. 3) We will evaluate the performance of mpMRI and urinary biomarkers to predict renal outcomes in a longitudinal study for the entire patient cohort up to 24 months. Our long-term objective is to validate a robust quantitative advanced mpMRI approach and develop models that accurately and non-invasively measure renal allograft fibrosis and clinical outcome, which may potentially impact the care of renal transplant patients by enabling early detection, the non-invasive longitudinal monitoring of disease, therapeutic efficacy of new drugs and for prognostication. Characterization of Renal Allograft Fibrosis and Prediction of Outcome Using a Quantitative MRI Approach Project Narrative Caused by a variety of etiologies, acute and chronic renal allograft injury often results in the development of interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IFTA), is a significant cause of allograft failure and poor outcomes; the reference standard for which is tissue biopsy, which is limited due to sampling error and risk of complications. In this proposal, we will develop a short, non-contrast multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) protocol, consisting of advanced relaxometry (T1 mapping and T1) and advanced diffusion weighted imaging (IVIM-DWI) to accurately detect and stage allograft fibrosis, taking into account confounding Banff variables of inflammation and tested against biopsy. We will also assess the added value of urinary biomarkers of IFTA and if successful, this study will benefit a large population of patients with renal allograft fibrosis in the United States, enabling early diagnosis, optimized treatment planning, prognostication and longitudinal disease monitoring.",Characterization of Renal Allograft Fibrosis and Prediction of Outcome Using a Quantitative MRI

"Enabling the Next Generation of High Performance Pediatric Whole Body MR Imaging Project Abstract Motivation: We aim to develop and implement a new approach to transform pediatric MRI. The ultimate goal is ultra-fast and motion-robust imaging in a dedicated child-friendly environment to enable more children undergo MRI without anesthesia. For those who still require anesthesia, it will be briefer and lighter, and performed in a safer environment. This project leverages a small compact magnet, designed for adult brain MRI, with gradients that enable very fast imaging. With this magnet as an outstanding starting point, we will tailor our deep experience and multiple successes in developing new MRI approaches to high-density receiver coils, fast imaging sequences, and new image reconstruction methods to set a new standard for pediatric MRI. Approach: Although the compact scanner is designed for adult heads, with a 37 cm inner diameter, it can accommodate children under eight to ten years of age to image any body part. To transform this system for ideal pediatric scanning, three development aims will be pursued. The ﬁrst is to enable optimal signal reception. This will be accomplished through creating new receive chain electronics that are matched to the gradient capabilities, for ultra-high bandwidth imaging. This will be coupled to very thin and formed receive arrays that maximize the size of the patient that can be accommodated in the small bore of the scanner. The second aim is to develop methods of obtaining the highest performance out of the system by characterizing and correcting for its imperfections. This will be coupled to a bespoke approach to peripheral nerve stimulation, enabling maximal use of the gradients on each patient. These two developments will then be leveraged for high efﬁciency and motion robust noncartesian scanning. The ﬁnal aim is to develop a full environment and infrastructure that is well suited to pediatric imaging. Patient preparation and acclimation to MRI will be enhanced by virtual reality. Support equipment for anesthesia, new physiological sensors, and a novel child-friendly audiovisual system will be created. Signiﬁcance: The result of this project will be a revolutionary change in the way that MRI is used and per- formed for children. MRI will be more available, cheaper, safer, and have markedly improved image quality. Project Narrative We will leverage the outstanding magnet and gradients of a unique small bore MRI scanner to create a new standard for unprecedented whole-body pediatric MR imaging. We will develop, integrate, and validate a set of technologies speciﬁcally for pediatric imaging. These include ultra-high bandwidth MRI signal reception from thin form-ﬁtting hardware, high-speed image data acquisition and image reconstruction, and environmental support appropriate for children.",Enabling the Next Generation of High Performance Pediatric Whole Body MR Imaging,10218169,U01EB029427,"['Acclimatization ', ' Acclimation ', ' Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anesthesia procedures ', ' Anesthesia ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' ECG ', ' EKG ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' Electronics ', ' electronic device ', ' Environment ', ' Equipment ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' hemodynamics ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Motivation ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Respiration ', ' respiratory mechanism ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Technology ', ' Temperature ', ' Testing ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Time ', ' Vendor ', ' Measures ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' density ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' whole body imaging ', ' whole body scanning ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Body part ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' respiratory ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' mate ', ' Partner in relationship ', ' Social Support System ', ' Support System ', ' Radiation ', ' virtual reality ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Resolution ', ' Flare ', ' Preparation ', ' Peripheral Nerve Stimulation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' reconstruction ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' 8 year old ', ' 8 years of age ', ' age 8 years ', ' eight year old ', ' eight years of age ', ' 10 year old ', ' 10 years of age ', ' age 10 years ', ' ten year old ', ' ten years of age ', ' data acquisition ', ' open source ', ' commercialization ', ' Cone ', ' pediatric patients ', ' child patients ', ' T2 weighted imaging ', ' T2 imaging ', ' T2 weighted image ', ' imaging system ', ' contrast imaging ', ' imaging capabilities ', ' Child Health ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Immersion ', ' ']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,838976,CA-18
