"CLINICAL DECISION SYSTEMS RESEARCH RESOURCE Attention and effort on this computer program for consultative diagnosis in medicine have been focused during the past year on two areas primarily, (a) the development of the new CADUCEUS program, and (b) the expansion and updating of the medical knowledge base. Prototypic computer programs have been written for the operation of CADUCEUS and have been preliminarily tested.  A substantial portion of the medical knowledge base (diseases of the liver and biliary tract) has been reorganized in the CADUCEUS format.  The installation of a dedicated VAX computer this summer will allow these programs to be tested critically and then further work can proceed on both elements. The knowledge base in internal medicine has been expanded so that it now includes over 500 diseases and some 3,450 individual manifestations of disease. Many disease entities which were programmed some years ago have been updated. It is gratifying but not unexpected that this expansion and updating have improved the performance of INTERNIST-I.  The pediatrics knowledge base has been significantly expanded also.  Considerable progress has been made on an anatomy knowledge base for utilization in CADUCEUS.  Progress has also been made on the reorganization of the diagnostic program to a form utilizable for educational and testing purposes by medical students and physicians.  Future work will proceed along all of these lines with emphasis on the organization and refinement of the CADUCEUS diagnostic program.

"CLINICAL DECISION SYSTEMS RESEARCH RESOURCE A new diagnostic procedure for CADUCEUS has been developed, which we believe provides a framework for solving all of the known problems encountered in our use of INTERNIST-1.  During the five year period covered by the current proposal, we intend to pursue the following specific aims:  Revision of the structure of the CADUCEUS knowledge base will be undertaken to support the enhanced capabilities of the new diagnostic procedure.  The revised knowledge base will be expanded to encompass all of the major diseases of internal medicine, and much of neurology.  Evaluation of the new CADUCEUS system will be undertaken in two phases. First, through protocol analytic studies, we intend to study and refine the human/machine interface of CADUCEUS, exploring specifically various modes of cooperative human/machine problem solving.  Subsequently, we plan to carry out formal evaluation studies of the system in order to gauge its diagnostic accuracy, the value of its information gathering and explanatory capability, and its acceptability to a variety of potential client groups.  The overall objective for this five year effort will be to bring CADUCEUS to a state of maturity that will permit its distribution for general use by medical practitioners.
